  "description": "Constraint-based models of microbial physiology: Surprisingly versatileMicrobial cells evolved a remarkable ability to adapt to environmental conditions, or to withstand otherwise detrimental mutations, which makes them often very resilient to man-made interventions. These properties arise from the integrative functioning of biological networks. Functional genomics has allowed the cost-effective measurement of the network components; however, we still mostly fail to understand how their interactions lead to cellular function and adaptation. For this, modeling is required. Current mainstream constraint-based metabolic modeling efforts largely focus on the metabolic network only, albeit at genome-scale. They are based on reaction stoichiometry only, but nonetheless can be extremely valuable for mostly exploratory analysis of the metabolic potential of an organism. However, because these \u201cFlux Balance Analysis\u201d (FBA) methods lack important parts of the cell \u2013with their associated constraints- they often fail to predict changes in common regulatory strategies. One view that is becoming dominant in cellular physiology, is that physical and (bio)chemical constraints limits protein content and synthesis, impacting on how resources are partitioned over growth and stress processes to optimize fitness (\u201ccellular economics\u201d). Such constraints can lead to (evolutionary) trade-offs and can explain a large number of microbial physiological phenomena, such as overflow metabolism or catabolite repression. Current efforts in the modeling field aim to include such resource constraints into the constraint-based modeling format. We have developed theory to understand what the solution is to a flux maximization problem under resource constraints. We found that Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs), mathematical definitions of minimal patways, are the flux maximisers. Although the number of EFMs is enormous (in the millions), the number of active constraints determines the maximum number of active EFMs at optimum. So complexity of the flux space seems to be determined by the constraints, not by the seemingly infinite possibilities. Still, the resource allocation perspective is developed for steady-state growth under constant environments. What happens during dynamic growth conditions is largely unexplored. Such analysis requires dynamic models, one of which is dynamic FBA. We conclude that the constraint-based modeling approach is a powerful and versatile approach to explain the physiology of a cell through the interactions of its molecular components and the governing physico-chemical and biochemical constraints."

  "description": "Avoiding the 4-index transformation in one-body reduced density matrix functional calculations for separable functionalsOne of the major computational bottlenecks in one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM) functional theory is the evaluation of approximate 1RDM functionals and their derivatives. The reason is that more advanced approximate functionals are almost exclusively defined in the natural orbital basis, so a 4-index transformation of the two-electron integrals appears to be unavoidable. I will show that this is not the case and that so-called separable functionals can be evaluated much more efficiently, i.e. only at cubic cost in the basis size. Since most approximate functionals are actually separable, this new algorithm is an important development to make 1RDM functional theory calculations feasible for large electronic systems."

Our Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital and energy decomposition analysis reveal a synergy that can be traced to a charge-transfer interaction in the halogen-bonded tetramers. The halogen lone-pair orbital on one monomer donates electrons into the unoccupied \u03c3*N\u2212X orbital on the perpendicular N\u2212X bond of the neighboring monomer. This interaction has local \u03c3 symmetry. Interestingly, we discovered a second, somewhat weaker donor\u2013acceptor interaction of local \u03c0 symmetry, which partially counteracts the aforementioned regular \u03c3-symmetric halogen-bonding orbital interaction. The halogen\u2013halogen interaction in haloamines is the first known example of a halogen bond in which back donation takes place. We also find that this cooperativity in halogen bonds results from the reduction of the donor\u2013acceptor orbital-energy gap that occurs every time a monomer is added to the aggregate."

  "description": "Consistent Treatment of Hydrophobicity in Protein Lattice Models Accounts for Cold DenaturationThe hydrophobic effect stabilizes the native structure of proteins by minimizing the unfavorable interactions between hydrophobic residues and water through the formation of a hydrophobic core. Here, we include the entropic and enthalpic contributions of the hydrophobic effect explicitly in an implicit solvent model. This allows us to capture two important effects: a length-scale dependence and a temperature dependence for the solvation of a hydrophobic particle. This consistent treatment of the hydrophobic effect explains cold denaturation and heat capacity measurements of solvated proteins."

  "description": "Een praktische gids voor probiotica ter preventie van antibiotica-gerelateerde diarree in NederlandBACKGROUND Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a side-effect frequently associated with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although a number of clinical studies show that co-administration of specific probiotics reduces the risk for AAD, there is still unclarity among healthcare professionals on the recommendation of probiotic products. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to provide a practical guide to inform healthcare professionals, patients and consumers about the exact product characteristics of available probiotics with a proven efficacy to prevent AAD. DESIGN and METHODS The workflow in this paper includes three consecutive steps: a systematic review of relevant clinical studies for effective probiotics by a meta-analysis, compilation of a list of available probiotic products, and recommendation of probiotic products that match effective formulations. Our systematic review on the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD included only studies with randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trials, a clear definition of antibiotic associated diarrhea, and a probiotic administration regime for at least the duration of the antibiotic therapy. RESULTS Using our inclusion criteria, we selected 32 out of 128 identified trials and pooled the results of these studies for each specific dairy product and food supplement. The results indicate a total of seven single or multiple-strain formulations favoring the probiotic treatment group, with the strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG being the most effective (relative risk ratio of probiotic versus placebo 0.30 with 95% CI 0.16 - 0.5]. We selected products for recommendation from a compiled list of all probiotic dairy products and food supplements available in The Netherlands and categorized them into groups of products showing effects against the incidence of AAD in at least one, two, or three independent clinical studies. We excluded all products which did not unambiguously declare on the label the specific probiotic strain(s) and the number of colony forming units. CONCLUSION Here, we present a practical guide that informs healthcare professionals and patients on the availability of probiotic products with a proven efficacy for the prevention of AAD."

  "description": "Protein cost allocation explains metabolic strategies in Escherichia coliIn-depth understanding of microbial growth is crucial for the development of new advances in biotechnology and for combating microbial pathogens. Condition-specific proteome expression is central to microbial physiology and growth. A multitude of processes are dependent on the protein expression, thus, whole-cell analysis of microbial metabolism using genome-scale metabolic models is an attractive toolset to investigate the behaviour of microorganisms and their communities. However, genome-scale models that incorporate macromolecular expression are still inhibitory complex: the conceptual and computational complexity of these models severely limits their potential applications. In the need for alternatives, here we revisit some of the previous attempts to create genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression to develop a novel framework for integrating protein abundance and turnover costs to conventional genome-scale models. We show that such a model of Escherichia coli successfully reproduces experimentally determined adaptations of metabolism in a growth condition-dependent manner. Moreover, the model can be used as means of investigating underutilization of the protein machinery among different growth settings. Notably, we obtained strongly improved predictions of flux distributions, considering the costs of protein translation explicitly. This finding in turn suggests protein translation being the main regulation hub for cellular growth."

  "description": "Effect of metallation, substituents and inter/intra-molecular polarization on electronic couplings for hole transport in stacked porphyrin dyadsWe carried out a systematic study of the hole transport properties for a series of symmetrically stacked porphyrin dimers. In the first part of this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of electronic couplings to orbital relaxation due to molecular ionization and intermolecular interactions for a series of halogenated porphyrins. The effect of polarization was estimated by comparing electronic couplings from fragment orbital density functional theory (FODFT) and frozen density embedding electron transfer (FDE-CT). For the dimers considered, the effect of polarization was estimated to be less than 20%, in line with previous studies on different molecular dimers. Thus, we decided to employ a computationally cheaper FODFT method to continue our study of the effect of metals and substituents on the electronic couplings for hole transfer. We find that, compared to the non-metallated porphyrins, Ni, Fe and Pt significantly reduce the coupling, while Zn, Ti, Cd and Pd increase it. The effect of substituents was studied on a series of meso-substituted porphyrins (meso-tetrapyridineporphyrin, meso-tetraphenylporphyrin and derivatives) for which we could relate a reduction of the coupling to steric effects that reduce the overlap between the frontier orbitals of the monomers."

  "description": "Properties, performance and associated hazards of state-of-the-art durable water repellent (DWR) chemistry for textile finishingFollowing the phase-out of long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), the textile industry had to find alternatives for side-chain fluorinated polymer based durable water repellent (DWR) chemistries that incorporated long perfluoroalkyl side chains. This phase-out and subsequent substitution with alternatives has resulted in a market where both fluorinated and non-fluorinated DWRs are available. These DWR alternatives can be divided into four broad groups that reflect their basic chemistry: side-chain fluorinated polymers, silicones, hydrocarbons and other chemistries (includes dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries). In this critical review, the alternative DWRs are assessed with regards to their structural properties and connected performance, loss and degradation processes resulting in diffuse environmental emissions, and hazard profiles for selected emitted substances. Our review shows that there are large differences in performance between the alternative DWRs, most importantly the lack of oil repellence of non-fluorinated alternatives. It also shows that for all alternatives, impurities and/or degradation products of the DWR chemistries are diffusively emitted to the environment. Our hazard ranking suggests that hydrocarbon based DWR is the most environmentally benign, followed by silicone and side-chain fluorinated polymer-based DWR chemistries. Industrial commitments to reduce the levels of impurities in silicone based and side-chain fluorinated polymer based DWR formulations will lower the actual risks. There is a lack of information on the hazards associated with DWRs, in particular for the dendrimer and inorganic nanoparticle chemistries, and these data gaps must be filled. Until environmentally safe alternatives, which provide the required performance, are available our recommendation is to choose DWR chemistry on a case-by-case basis, always weighing the benefits connected to increased performance against the risks to the environment and human health."

  "description": "Effect of Intra- and Intermolecular Interactions on the Properties of para-Substituted Nitrobenzene DerivativesTo study the influence of intra- and intermolecular interactions on properties of the nitro group in para-substituted nitrobenzene derivatives, two sources of data were used: (i) Cambridge Structural Database and (ii) quantum chemistry modeling. In the latter case, \u201cpure\u201d intramolecular interactions were simulated by gradual rotation of the nitro group in para-nitroaniline, whereas H-bond formation at the amino group allowed the intermolecular interactions to be accounted for. BLYP functional with dispersion correction and TZ2P basis set (ADF program) were used to perform all calculations. It was found that properties of the nitro group dramatically depend on both its orientation with respect to the benzene ring as well as on the substituent in the para-position. The nitro group lies in the plane of the benzene ring for only a small number of molecules, whereas the mean value of the twist angle is 7.3 deg, mostly due to intermolecular interactions in the crystals. This distortion from planarity and the nature of para-substituent influence the aromaticity of the ring (described by HOMA index) and properties of the nitro group due to electronic effects. The results obtained by QM calculations fully coincide with observations found for the data set of crystal structures. "

  "description": "Time-dependent Dyson orbital theoryAlthough time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has become the tool of choice for real-time propagation of the electron density \u03c1N(t) of N-electron systems, it also encounters problems in this application. The first problem is the neglect of memory effects stemming from the, in TDDFT virtually unavoidable, adiabatic approximation, the second problem is the reliable evaluation of the probabilities Pn(t) of multiple photoinduced ionization, while the third problem (which TDDFT shares with other approaches) is the reliable description of continuum states of the electrons ejected in the process of ionization. In this paper time-dependent Dyson orbital theory (TDDOT) is proposed. Exact TDDOT equations of motion (EOMs) for time-dependent Dyson orbitals are derived, which are linear differential equations with just static, feasible potentials of the electron\u2013electron interaction. No adiabatic approximation is used, which formally resolves the first TDDFT problem. TDDOT offers formally exact expressions for the complete evolution in time of the wavefunction of the outgoing electron. This leads to the correlated probability of single ionization P1(t) as well as the probabilities of no ionization (P0(t)) and multiple ionization of n electrons, Pn(t), which formally solves the second problem of TDDFT. For two-electron systems a proper description of the required continuum states appears to be rather straightforward, and both P1(t) and P2(t) can be calculated. Because of the exact formulation, TDDOT is expected to reproduce a notorious memory effect, the \u201cknee structure\u201d of the non-sequential double ionization of the He atom."

  "description": "Corporate-NGO partnership for environmentally sustainable innovation: Lessons from a cross-sector collaboration in aviation biofuelsThis paper studies the initiation of a partnership between a corporation and a nongovernmental organization (NGO) for environmentally sustainable innovation, as well as its development over time. Proceeding from a dynamic capabilities approach, it provides a retrospective, longitudinal examination of a 10-year partnership between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature Netherlands (WNF), which promoted a market for aviation biofuels. The case study suggests that the progress of the partnership is determined by three specific dynamic capabilities of KLM and WNF: learning, coordination, and reconfiguration. The results reveal two microfoundations for each of these dynamic capabilities. For learning, these microfoundations are the sensing of strategic partners and the co-specialization of resources. For coordination, these consist of finding a fit between partners and having an integrated mission. Finally, the microfoundations of reconfiguration are the fostering of an institutional dialogue and the setting of new industry standards. This study is beneficial to scholars as it opens a research avenue concerning the dynamic capabilities and microfoundations that support corporate-NGO partnering for environmentally sustainable innovation. Practitioners can use these dynamic capabilities and microfoundations as guidelines for developing their own specific corporate-NGO partnerships."

  "description": "Network medicine framework shows that proximity of polyphenol targets and disease proteins predicts therapeutic effects of polyphenolsPolyphenols, natural products present in plant-based foods, play a protective role against several complex diseases through their antioxidant activity and by diverse molecular mechanisms. Here we develop a network medicine framework to uncover mechanisms for the effects of polyphenols on health by considering the molecular interactions between polyphenol protein targets and proteins associated with diseases. We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighbourhoods of the human interactome, whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the molecule\u2019s known therapeutic effects. The methodology recovers known associations, such as the effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on type 2 diabetes, and predicts that rosmarinic acid has a direct impact on platelet function, representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health. We experimentally confirm that rosmarinic acid inhibits platelet aggregation and \u03b1-granule secretion through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, offering direct support for the predicted molecular mechanism. Our framework represents a starting point for mechanistic interpretation of the health effects underlying food-related compounds, allowing us to integrate into a predictive framework knowledge on food metabolism, bioavailability and drug interaction. Molecular interactions between polyphenol targets and proteins associated with disease are explored through a network medicine framework. The network proximity of polyphenol protein targets to disease proteins can predict therapeutic effects, highlighting more broadly the potential of network medicine as a tool for nutritional sciences."

It became clear that the inclusion of information to enhance discussions among this mix of participants would be even more valuable.

The new method termed time-dependent density functional theory TD-DFT+TB does not rely on the DFTB parametrization and is therefore applicable to systems involving all combinations of elements. We show that the new method yields UV/Vis absorption spectra that are in excellent agreement with computationally much more expensive TD-DFT calculations. Errors in vertical excitation energies are reduced by a factor of two compared to TD-DFTB."

Previous studies from our group lead to the evidence that its overexpression in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. In the present study, we intended to extend the analysis of RAC1b expression to thyroid follicular neoplasms and to seek for clinical correlations. RAC1b expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR in thyroid follicular tumor samples comprising 23 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) and 33 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTAs). RAC1b was found to be overexpressed in 33% of carcinomas while no RAC1b overexpression was documented among follicular adenomas. Patients with a diagnosis of FTC were divided into two groups based on longitudinal evolution and final outcome. RAC1b overexpression was significantly associated with both the presence of distant metastases (P = 0.01) and poorer clinical outcome (P = 0.01) suggesting that, similarly to that previously found in PTCs, RAC1b overexpression in FTCs is also associated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, the absence of RAC1b overexpression in follicular adenomas hints its potential as a molecular marker likely to contribute, in conjunction with other putative markers, to the preoperative differential diagnosis of thyroid follicular lesions."

To better understand the mechanism of the hydrolytic cleavage of the Si\u2013alkoxy moiety of alkoxy(aminoalkyl)silanes (an important key step in the formation of amino-functionalized polysiloxanes), a systematic experimental and computational study on the hydrolysis of alkoxy(aminoalkyl)diorganylsilanes of the formula type R2(RO)Si(CH2)nNH2 (R = alkyl, n = 1\u20133) was conducted. For reasons of comparison, silanes of the formula types R2(RO)SiC(H)MeCH2NH2 and R2(RO)Si(CH2)nX [R = alkyl; n = 1\u20133; X = N(H)Me, NMe2, piperidino, NMe3+I\u2013, N(H)COOMe, N(Me)COOMe] and compounds Me2(MeO)Si(CH2)6Me and Me2(MeO)Si(CH2)6NH2 were included in this study. For this purpose, the various silanes were synthesized and studied for their hydrolysis kinetics in CD3CN/D2O under acidic and basic conditions by using 1H NMR spectroscopy as the analytic tool. These experimental investigations were complemented by computational studies (calculation of proton affinities, reaction barriers, and energies relative to reactants of intermediate transition complexes). The different hydrolysis reactivities observed are the result of a number of parameters, such as electronic and steric effects, the strong impact of the pD value, and intramolecular N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds between the protonated amino group and the alkoxy leaving group. This comprehensive study provided deep insight into the mechanism of hydrolysis of analogous \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-amino-functionalized alkoxy(aminoalkyl)diorganylsilanes of the formula type R2(RO)Si(CH2)nNH2 (R = organyl, n = 1\u20133) and a series of related \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 analogues with other nitrogen-based functional groups."

  "description": "Exchange\u2013Correlation Functionals via Local Interpolation along the Adiabatic ConnectionThe construction of density-functional approximations is explored by modeling the adiabatic connection locally, using energy densities defined in terms of the electrostatic potential of the exchange\u2013correlation hole. These local models are more amenable to the construction of size-consistent approximations than their global counterparts. In this work we use accurate input local ingredients to assess the accuracy of a range of local interpolation models against accurate exchange\u2013correlation energy densities. The importance of the strictly correlated electrons (SCE) functional describing the strong coupling limit is emphasized, enabling the corresponding interpolated functionals to treat strong correlation effects. In addition to exploring the performance of such models numerically for the helium and beryllium isoelectronic series and the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule, an approximate analytic model is presented for the initial slope of the local adiabatic connection. Comparisons are made with approaches based on global models, and prospects for future approximations based on the local adiabatic connection are discussed."

  "description": "Not Carbon s\u2013p Hybridization, but Coordination Number Determines C\u2212H and C\u2212C Bond LengthA fundamental and ubiquitous phenomenon in chemistry is the contraction of both C\u2212H and C\u2212C bonds as the carbon atoms involved vary, in s\u2013p hybridization, along sp3 to sp2 to sp. Our quantum chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above-mentioned shortening in C\u2212H and C\u2212C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of s-character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp3 to sp2 to sp."

  "description": "From functional potential of soil bacterial communities towards petroleum hydrocarbons bioremediationMolecular ecology researches are rapidly advancing the knowledge of microorganisms associated with petroleum hydrocarbon degradation, one of the major large-scale pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems. The design and monitoring of bioremediation techniques for hydrocarbons rely on a thorough understanding of the diversityof enzymes involved in the processes of hydrocarbon degradation and the microbes that harbor their allocated genes. This review describes the impact of hydrocarbon pollution on soil microbial communities, the state of the art of detecting functional genes, and functional groups. We will focus on i) the structure, function and succession behavior of microbial communities exposed to hydrocarbons, ii) key genes and pathways, iii) future prospect into bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in aerobic environments. The aim is to get a fundamental insight in these issues to ultimately improve petroleum hydrocarbons bioremediation.Keywords: Petroleum hydrocarbons, microbial communities, functional genes, oil degradation, bioremediation"

  "description": "Detection and prioritization of unknown compounds in water extracts from drinking water production.The goal of this study is to enhance the identification of unknown compounds inLC chromatograms of untreated raw water used for drinking water production by(1) preconcentration of samples and (2) prioritization of the unknown peaks basedon their bioactivity. Preconcentration was done by solid phase extraction (SPE) of3L large volume (LV) groundwater samples or by 6-week passive sampler (PS)deployment in the groundwater, using divinylbenzene as active phase. Bioactivityof the samples was tested as a decrease in bioluminescence in the Allivibriofischeri bioassay, which was chosen as a broad-scale bioanalytical tool respondingto many different types of pollutants. Samples were collected at three differentdrinking water production stations with low or high degree of anthropogenicinfluence. At two stations, different groundwater inlets were sampled. At onestation, samples were taken at different stages in the drinking water productionprocess. SPE and PS extracts were used for target analysis and non-targetscreening, and for testing in the bioassay before and after high-resolutionfractionation. More target compounds were detected in the concentrated LV andPS extracts than in a 1 mL direct injection of the water. As expected leastcompounds and lowest bioassay responses were detected in the raw water fromthe station with least anthropogenic influence. PS extracts gave much higherbioassay responses than the LV extracts. Both chemical and bioassay analysis ofsamples collected during subsequent steps in the drinking water productionprocess confirmed the efficient removal of (bioactive) contaminants. In addition tothe 4 peaks detected in the bioassay chromatogram of the reference station, themore anthropogenically influenced stations showed additional peaks indicative forthe presence of anthropogenic substances. Identification of suspect compoundsresponsible for these additional peaks will proceed according to a three-stepprocedure, i.e. based on (1) exact mass and isotopic pattern of compoundsavailable in different suspect lists, (2) fragment ions assigned to a precursoravailable in spectral libraries, and (3) estimated elemental composition. Referencestandards will be obtained for the suspect compounds to confirm their retentiontime and bioactivity. Results from the identification process are available by theend of May 2020, and will be presented at the SETAC Europe conference."

  "description": "Structure and dynamics of a mycobacterial typeVII secretion systemMycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of one of the most important infectious diseases in humans, which leads to 1.4 million deaths every year1. Specialized protein transport systems-known as type VII secretion systems (T7SSs)-are central to the virulence of this pathogen, and are also crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport across the mycobacterial cell envelope2,3. Here we present the structure of an intact T7SS inner-membrane complex of M. tuberculosis. We show how the 2.32-MDa ESX-5 assembly, which contains 165 transmembrane helices, is restructured and stabilized as a trimer of dimers by the MycP5 protease. A trimer of MycP5 caps a central periplasmic dome-like chamber that is formed by three EccB5 dimers, with the proteolytic sites of MycP5 facing towards the cavity. This chamber suggests a central secretion and processing conduit. Complexes without MycP5 show disruption of the EccB5 periplasmic assembly and increased flexibility, which highlights the importance of MycP5 for complex integrity. Beneath the EccB5-MycP5 chamber, dimers of the EccC5 ATPase assemble into three bundles of four transmembrane helices each, which together seal the potential central secretion channel. Individual cytoplasmic EccC5 domains adopt two distinctive conformations that probably reflect different secretion states. Our work suggests a previously undescribed mechanism of protein transport and provides a structural scaffold to aid in the development of drugs against this major human pathogen."

  "description": "Improvements on the minimax algorithm for the laplace transformation of orbital energy denominatorsWe present a robust and non-heuristic algorithm that finds all extremum points of the error distribution function of numerically Laplace-transformed orbital energy denominators. The extremum point search is one of the two key steps for finding the minimax approximation. If pre-tabulation of initial guesses is supposed to be avoided, strategies for a sufficiently robust algorithm have not been discussed so far. We compare our non-heuristic approach with a bracketing and bisection algorithm and demonstrate that 3 times less function evaluations are required altogether when applying it to typical non-relativistic and relativistic quantum chemical systems."

  "description": "Resilience of soil microbial communities to metals and additional stressors: DNA-Based approaches for assessing \"stress-on-stress\" responsesMany microbial ecology studies have demonstrated profound changes in community composition caused by environmental pollution, as well as adaptation processes allowing survival of microbes in polluted ecosystems. Soil microbial communities in polluted areas with a long-term history of contamination have been shown to maintain their function by developing metal-tolerance mechanisms. In the present work, we review recent experiments, with specific emphasis on studies that have been conducted in polluted areas with a long-term history of contamination that also applied DNA-based approaches. We evaluate how the \u201ccosts\u201d of adaptation to metals affect the responses of metal-tolerant communities to other stress factors (\u201cstress-on-stress\u201d). We discuss recent studies on the stability of microbial communities, in terms of resistance and resilience to additional stressors, focusing on metal pollution as the initial stress, and discuss possible factors influencing the functional and structural stability of microbial communities towards secondary stressors. There is increasing evidence that the history of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes play central roles in responses of microbial communities towards secondary stressors."

  "description": "Nucleophilic substitution at di- and triphosphates: leaving group ability of phosphate versus diphosphateAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the universal energy carrier in biochemical processes. Herein, we aim for a better understanding of the origin of the high-energy content of the triphosphate moiety involved, the influence of various physicochemical factors thereon, and implication for the actual SN2@P-induced hydrolysis, which drives uphill biochemical processes, such as, DNA replication. To this end, we have investigated the SN2@P-induced hydrolysis of triphosphate (PPP) versus that of diphosphate (PP) using density functional theory (DFT) at COSMO(H2O)-ZORA-OLYP/TZ2P. We find that SN2@P-induced hydrolysis of PPP is favored over that of PP, both kinetically and thermodynamically. The energetic advantage of PPP over PP is slightly diminished by the coordination of Mg2+ counterions. Our activation strain and energy decomposition analyses reveal that the activation barrier for PPP hydrolysis is lower compared to that for PP due to a weaker P\u03b1\u2013O leaving group bond."

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.In cetaceans, blubber is the primary and largest lipid body reservoir. Our current understanding about lipid stores and uses in cetaceans is still limited, and most studies only focused on a single narrow snapshot of the lipidome. We documented an extended lipidomic fingerprint in two cetacean species present in northern Norway during wintertime. We were able to detect 817 molecular lipid species in blubber of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The profiles were largely dominated by triradylglycerols in both species and, to a lesser extent, by other constituents including glycerophosphocholines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and diradylglycerols. Through a unique combination of traditional statistical approaches, together with a novel bioinformatic tool (LION/web), we showed contrasting fingerprint composition between species. The higher content of triradylglycerols in humpback whales is necessary to fuel their upcoming half a year fasting and energy-demanding migration between feeding and breeding grounds. In adipocytes, we assume that the intense feeding rate of humpback whales prior to migration translates into an important accumulation of triacylglycerol content in lipid droplets. Upstream, the endoplasmic reticulum is operating at full capacity to supply acute lipid storage, consistent with the reported enrichment of glycerophosphocholines in humpback whales, major components of the endoplasmic reticulum. There was also an enrichment of membrane components, which translates into higher sphingolipid content in the lipidome of killer whales, potentially as a structural adaptation for their higher hydrodynamic performance. Finally, the presence of both lipid-enriched and lipid-depleted individuals within the killer whale population in Norway suggests dietary specialization, consistent with significant differences in \u03b415N and \u03b413C isotopic ratios in skin between the two groups, with higher values and a wider niche for the lipid-enriched individuals.

  "description": "Cooperative Self-Assembly in Linear ChainsBased on Halogen Bonds\u00a9 2021 The Authors. ChemPlusChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbHCooperative properties of halogen bonds were investigated with computational experiments based on dispersion-corrected relativistic density functional theory. The bonding mechanism in linear chains of cyanogen halide (X\u2212CN), halocyanoacetylene (X\u2212CC\u2212CN), and 4-halobenzonitrile (X\u2212C6H4\u2212CN) were examined for X = H, Cl, Br, and I. Our energy decomposition and Kohn-Sham molecular-orbital analyses revealed the bonding mechanism of the studied systems. Cyanogen halide and halocyanoacetylene chains possess an extra stabilizing effect with increasing chain size, whereas the 4-halobenzonitrile chains do not. This cooperativity can be traced back to charge separation within the \u03c3-electronic system by charge-transfer between the lone-pair orbital of the nitrogen (\u03c3HOMO) on one unit and the acceptor orbital of the C\u2212X (\u03c3*LUMO) on the adjacent unit. As such, the HOMO-LUMO gap in the \u03c3-system decreases, and the cooperativity increases with chain length revealing the similarity in the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen and halogen bonds."

  "title": "D-dopachrome tautomerase contributes to lung epithelial repair via atypical chemokine receptor 3-dependent Akt signaling\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)Background: Emphysematous COPD is characterized by aberrant alveolar repair. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) contributes to alveolar repair, but for its structural and functional homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) this is unknown. MIF mediates its effects through CD74 and/or C-X-C chemokine receptors 2 (CXCR2), 4(CXCR4), and possibly 7 (ACKR3). DDT can also signal through CD74, but interactions with other receptors have not been described yet. We therefore aimed at investigating if and how DDT contributes to epithelial repair in COPD. Methods: We studied effects of recombinant DDT on cell proliferation and survival by clonogenic assay and annexin V-PI staining respectively. DDT-induced signaling was investigated by Western blot. Effects on epithelial growth and differentiation was studied using lung organoid cultures with primary murine or human epithelial cells and incubating with DDT or an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. DDT-ACKR3 interactions were identified by ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation. Findings: We found that DDT promoted proliferation of and prevented staurosporine-induced apoptosis in A549 lung epithelial cells. Importantly, DDT also stimulated growth of primary alveolar epithelial cells as DDT treatment resulted in significantly more and larger murine and human alveolar organoids compared to untreated controls. The anti-apoptotic effect of DDT and DDT-induced organoid growth were inhibited in the presence of an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. Furthermore, ELISA assay and co-immunoprecipitation suggested DDT complexes with ACKR3. DDT could activate the PI3K-Akt pathway and this activation was enhanced in ACKR3-overexpressing cells. Interpretation: In conclusion, DDT contributes to alveolar epithelial repair via ACKR3 and may thus augment lung epithelial repair in COPD.General information",

  "description": "Reduced mGluR5 Activity Modulates Mitochondrial FunctionThe metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is an essential modulator of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory; whereas in pathological conditions, it is an acknowledged therapeutic target that has been implicated in multiple brain disorders. Despite robust pre-clinical data, mGluR5 antagonists failed in several clinical trials, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mGluR5 function. In this study, we dissected the molecular synaptic modulation mediated by mGluR5 using genetic and pharmacological mouse models to chronically and acutely reduce mGluR5 activity. We found that next to dysregulation of synaptic proteins, the major regulation in protein expression in both models concerned specific processes in mitochondria, such as oxidative phosphorylation. Second, we observed morphological alterations in shape and area of specifically postsynaptic mitochondria in mGluR5 KO synapses using electron microscopy. Third, computational and biochemical assays suggested an increase of mitochondrial function in neurons, with increased level of NADP/H and oxidative damage in mGluR5 KO. Altogether, our observations provide diverse lines of evidence of the modulation of synaptic mitochondrial function by mGluR5. This connection suggests a role for mGluR5 as a mediator between synaptic activity and mitochondrial function, a finding which might be relevant for the improvement of the clinical potential of mGluR5."

To (a) determine the correlation between the local genetic ancestry components and vitamin B12 levels using ninety B12-related genes; (b) determine associations between these genes and their SNPs with vitamin B12 levels; (c) determine a polygenic risk score (PRS) using significant variants. This cross-sectional study included 168 children and adolescents, aged 9-13 years old. Total cobalamin was measured in plasma. Genotyping arrays and whole exome data were combined to yield\u2009~\u20097000 SNPs in 90 genes related to vitamin B12. The Efficient Local Ancestry Inference was used to estimate local ancestry for African (AFR), Native American, and European (EUR). The association between the genotypes and vitamin B12 levels were determined with generalized estimating equation. Vitamin B12 levels were driven by positive (EUR) and negative (AFR, AMR) correlations with genetic ancestry. A set of 36 variants were used to create a PRS that explained 42% of vitamin level variation. Vitamin B12 levels are influenced by genetic ancestry and a PRS explained almost 50% of the variation in plasma cobalamin in Brazilian children and adolescents."

Subsequent regio- and diastereoselective, inter- and intramolecular dipolar cycloaddition reactions with variously substituted electron-deficient alkenes enabled ready and efficient access to structurally complex pyrrolidine architectures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the dipolar cycloaddition reactions uncovered an intimate balance between asynchronicity and interaction energies of transition structures, which ultimately control the unusual selectivities observed in certain cases."

This low-order scaling technique can be used to enable correlated relativistic calculations for large molecular systems. We show that the working equations to compute the relativistic MP2 energy differ by merely a change of algebra (quaternion instead of real) from their non-relativistic counterparts. With a proof-of-principle implementation we study the effect of the nuclear charge on the magnitude of half-transformed integrals and show that for light elements spin-free and spin-orbit MP2 energies are almost identical. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of separation of charge distributions on the Coulomb and exchange energy contributions, which show the same long-range decay with the inter-electronic/atomic distance as for non-relativistic MP2. A linearly scaling implementation is possible if the proper distance behavior is introduced to the quaternion Schwarz-type estimates as for non-relativistic MP2."

  "description": "Modified Guanines as Constituents of Smart Ligands for Nucleic Acid QuadruplexesRepetitive guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and the cell life cycle and represent potential targets for regulatory drugs. Recently, it has been demonstrated that guanine-based ligands with a porphyrin core can be used as markers of G-quadruplex assemblies in cell tissues. Herein, model systems of guanine-based ligands are explored by DFT methods. The energies of formation of modified guanine tetrads and those of modified tetrads stacked on the top of natural guanine tetrads have been calculated. The interaction energy has been decomposed into contributions from hydrogen bonding, stacking, and ion coordination and a twist\u2013rise potential energy scan has been performed to find the individual local minima. Energy decomposition analysis reveals the impact of various substituents (F, Cl, Br, I, Me, NMe2) on individual energy terms. In addition, cooperative reinforcement in forming the modified and stacked tetrads, as well as the frontier orbitals participating in the hydrogen-bonding framework involving the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap between the occupied \u03c3HOMO on the proton-accepting C=O and =N\u2212 groups and unoccupied \u03c3LUMO on the N\u2212H groups, has been studied. The investigated systems are demonstrated to have a potential in ligand development, mainly due to stacking enhancement compared with natural guanine, which is used as a reference."

  "title": "A multiphase multiobjective dynamic genome-scale model shows different redox balancing among yeast species of the saccharomyces genus in fermentation\u00a9 2021 Henriques et al.Yeasts constitute over 1,500 species with great potential for biotechnology. Still, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae dominates industrial applications, and many alternative physiological capabilities of lesser-known yeasts are not being fully exploited. While comparative genomics receives substantial attention, little is known about yeasts' metabolic specificity in batch cultures. Here, we propose a multiphase multiobjective dynamic genome-scale model of yeast batch cultures that describes the uptake of carbon and nitrogen sources and the production of primary and secondary metabolites. The model integrates a specific metabolic reconstruction, based on the consensus Yeast8, and a kinetic model describing the time-varying culture environment. In addition, we proposed a multiphase multiobjective flux balance analysis to compute the dynamics of intracellular fluxes. We then compared the metabolism of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum strains in a rich medium fermentation. The model successfully explained the experimental data and brought novel insights into how cryotolerant strains achieve redox balance. The proposed model (along with the corresponding code) provides a comprehensive picture of the main steps occurring inside the cell during batch cultures and offers a systematic approach to prospect or metabolically engineering novel yeast cell factories.General information",

  "description": "A multiphase multiobjective dynamic genome-scale model shows different redox balancing among yeast species of the saccharomyces genus in fermentation\u00a9 2021 Henriques et al.Yeasts constitute over 1,500 species with great potential for biotechnology. Still, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae dominates industrial applications, and many alternative physiological capabilities of lesser-known yeasts are not being fully exploited. While comparative genomics receives substantial attention, little is known about yeasts' metabolic specificity in batch cultures. Here, we propose a multiphase multiobjective dynamic genome-scale model of yeast batch cultures that describes the uptake of carbon and nitrogen sources and the production of primary and secondary metabolites. The model integrates a specific metabolic reconstruction, based on the consensus Yeast8, and a kinetic model describing the time-varying culture environment. In addition, we proposed a multiphase multiobjective flux balance analysis to compute the dynamics of intracellular fluxes. We then compared the metabolism of S. cerevisiae and Saccharomyces uvarum strains in a rich medium fermentation. The model successfully explained the experimental data and brought novel insights into how cryotolerant strains achieve redox balance. The proposed model (along with the corresponding code) provides a comprehensive picture of the main steps occurring inside the cell during batch cultures and offers a systematic approach to prospect or metabolically engineering novel yeast cell factories."

  "description": "How sticky are our proteins? Quantifying hydrophobicity of the human proteomeProteins tend to bury hydrophobic residues inside their core during the folding process to provide stability to the protein structure and to prevent aggregation. Nevertheless, proteins do expose some 'sticky' hydrophobic residues to the solvent. These residues can play an important functional role, for example in protein-protein and membrane interactions. Here, we investigate how hydrophobic protein surfaces are by providing three measures for surface hydrophobicity: the total hydrophobic surface area, the relative hydrophobic surface area, and - using our MolPatch method - the largest hydrophobic patch. Secondly, we analyse how difficult it is to predict these measures from sequence: by adapting solvent accessibility predictions from NetSurfP2.0, we obtain well-performing prediction methods for the THSA and RHSA, while predicting LHP is more difficult. Finally, we analyse implications of exposed hydrophobic surfaces: we show that hydrophobic proteins typically have low expression, suggesting cells avoid an overabundance of sticky proteins. "

  "description": "Predicting Pt-195 NMR chemical shift using new relativistic all-electron basis setPredicting NMR properties is a valuable tool to assist the experimentalists in the characterization of molecular structure. For heavy metals, such as Pt-195, only a few computational protocols are available. In the present contribution, all-electron Gaussian basis sets, suitable to calculate the Pt-195 NMR chemical shift, are presented for Pt and all elements commonly found as Pt-ligands. The new basis sets identified as NMR-DKH were partially contracted as a triple-zeta doubly polarized scheme with all coefficients obtained from a Douglas\u2013Kroll\u2013Hess (DKH) second-order scalar relativistic calculation. The Pt-195 chemical shift was predicted through empirical models fitted to reproduce experimental data for a set of 183 Pt(II) complexes which NMR sign ranges from \u22121000 to \u22126000 ppm. Furthermore, the models were validated using a new set of 75 Pt(II) complexes, not included in the descriptive set. The models were constructed using non-relativistic Hamiltonian at density functional theory (DFT-PBEPBE) level with NMR-DKH basis set for all atoms. For the best model, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the mean relative deviation (MRD) were 150 ppm and 6%, respectively, for the validation set (75 Pt-complexes) and 168 ppm (MAD) and 5% (MRD) for all 258 Pt(II) complexes. These results were comparable with relativistic DFT calculation, 200 ppm (MAD) and 6% (MRD). "

The aim of this study was to explore differences in proteomic profiles, for 117 pro-inflammatory proteins, in two previously defined groups of individuals with different DNA damage and EPA and DHA levels. Healthy children and adolescents (n = 140) aged 9 to 13 years old in an urban area of Brazil were divided by k-means cluster test into two clusters of DNA damage (tail intensity) using the comet assay (cluster 1 = 5.9% \u00b1 1.2 and cluster 2 = 13.8% \u00b1 3.1) in our previous study. The cluster with higher DNA damage and lower levels of DHA (6.2 \u00b1 1.6 mg/dL; 5.4 \u00b1 1.3 mg/dL, p = 0.003) and EPA (0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mg/dL; 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 mg/dL, p < 0.001) presented increased expression of the proteins CDK8\u2013CCNC, PIK3CA\u2013PIK3R1, KYNU, and PRKCB, which are involved in pro-inflammatory pathways. Our findings support the hypothesis that low levels of n-3 long-chain PUFA may have a less protective role against DNA damage through expression of pro-inflammatory proteins, such as CDK8\u2013CCNC, PIK3CA\u2013PIK3R1, KYNU, and PRKCB."

Forty-three novel H4R interactors were identified, of which 17 have also been previously observed in MYTH screens to interact with other GPCR subtypes. The interaction of H4R with the tetraspanin TSPAN4 was confirmed in transfected cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. Histamine stimulation reduced the interaction between H4R and TSPAN4, but TSPAN4 did not affect H4R-mediated G protein signaling. Nonetheless, the identification of novel GPCR interactors by MYTH is a starting point to further investigate the regulation of GPCR signaling."

  "description": "On-top description of the effect of excitation on electron correlation with quasiparticles\u00a92021 American Physical SocietyA spectrum of -correlon quasiparticles is proposed to describe the excitation effect on electron correlation. The proposed quasiparticle description is based on the comparison of the pair-correlation functions of the excited and ground states at the special coalescence points of the configurational space. The complex form of the -correlon wave function allows us to naturally separate regions with the excitation suppression of correlation (ESC -correlon), where correlation is stronger in the ground state, from those with the excitation enhancement of correlation (EEC -correlon), where correlation is stronger in the excited state. The proposed -correlon approach is applied to characterize the important single excitations with the competition of \u201canticorrelation squeezing\u201d and \u201cenhanced-correlation spreading\u201d of the two-electron distribution. The former feature characterizes single valence excitations of the ionic nature and this leads to the prevailing of the ESC effect in this type of excitations. In turn, the enhanced-correlation spreading characterizes single Rydberg excitations, which leads to the prevailing of the EEC effect in this type of excitations. The proposed -correlon quasiparticles are studied both analytically and numerically. The analytical expressions for the on-top correlation functions are obtained with the two-determinantal two-electron model of the active site of an excitation. The two-dimensional contour plots of the ESC and EEC -correlons obtained for the lowest vertical valence ionic and Rydberg excitations in the prototype molecules , and from the highly correlated wave functions confirm, in general, the trends in the relative correlation strength deduced from the model."

This study aims to illuminate the detailed components of managing service innovations at OTAs.Design/methodology/approachAn in-depth case study is conducted at Trip, the largest OTA in China. A coherent framework of managing service innovations at OTAs is proposed through refining an existing framework from new service development (NSD), and concerning the success factors of service innovation. Based on theoretical synthesis and empirical analysis, the NSD framework is adapted, restructured and refined for service innovation management at OTAs.FindingsThe proposed framework contains three facets and associated managerial elements: (1) resources, including stakeholders, technologies and systems; (2) contexts, including innovation strategy, structure and culture; and (3) ideation, including idea generation and idea application. Different success factors are attached to the managerial elements. The facets, managerial elements and success factors serve as the components in the framework.Research limitations/implicationsThis study provides academia with an analytical framework to understand and interpret service innovation management at OTAs, which can be used as a point of departure for future research.Practical implicationsThe analytical framework inspires OTA managers to adopt a structured approach in service innovation management, and policymakers to design related interventions.Originality/valueThis study offers a first step toward the investigation of service innovation management at OTAs, specifically in China. The proposed framework is potentially applicable to other industries.[With also Chinese summary, see DOI.]"

  "description": "De microbemens: Het belang van het onzichtbare levenDe mens is een wandelend ecosysteem. Ons leven lang verschaffen we de juiste omstandigheden aan een gigantische gemeenschap van micro-organismen in ons lichaam. Toch zien we microben voornamelijk als veroorzakers van ziekte en bederf en proberen we ze juist uit alle macht te verdelgen met antibiotica en ontsmettingsmiddelen. Maar we kunnen er niet omheen. Vanaf de kolonisatie van ons lichaam bij onze geboorte tot de ontbinding na onze dood: bacteri\u00ebn spelen een onmisbare rol in ons leven. Deze cruciale rol wordt in De microbemens op onnavolgbare wijze onder de loep genomen. Microben zijn net mensen: ze zoeken naar eten, hebben seks en wisselen van lifestyle. Wij treden op als hun gastheer. We lezen waar ze in ons lichaam zitten, hoe we ze voeden en wat zij ons bieden. We blijken niet meer dan een slaaf te zijn van onze microben. We moeten onze eetlust de baas zien te worden en ons bevrijden van onze onzichtbare ketenen. Als een ware microbenmeester moeten we in deze moderne tijd niet te eenzijdig en ongericht inzetten op het verdelgen van de microben \u2013 met opkomende immuunziekten en antibioticum resistentie als gevolg. Microbenmissionaris Remco Kort brengt gezonde bacteri\u00ebn naar het Afrikaanse continent, waar gezonde drinkyoghurt wordt gemaakt. We reizen met hem mee. Eindelijk, na meer dan drie eeuwen duisternis, krijgen microben de erkenning die ze verdienen. Vanaf nu staan ze vol in de schijnwerpers. We zullen ze nooit meer over het hoofd te zien."

  "description": "libRCGA: a C library for real-coded genetic algorithms for rapid parameter estimation of kinetic modelsKinetic modeling is a powerful tool to understand how a biochemical system behaves as a whole. To develop a realistic and predictive model, kinetic parameters need to be estimated so that a model fits experimental data. However, parameter estimation remains a major bottleneck in kinetic modeling. To accelerate parameter estimation, we developed a C library for real-coded genetic algorithms (libRCGA). In libRCGA, two real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs), viz. the Unimodal Normal Distribution Crossover with Minimal Generation Gap (UNDX/MGG) and the Real-coded Ensemble Crossover star with Just Generation Gap (REX star/JGG), are implemented in C language and paralleled by Message Passing Interface (MPI). We designed libRCGA to take advantage of high-performance computing environments and thus to significantly accelerate parameter estimation. Constrained optimization formulation is useful to construct a realistic kinetic model that satisfies several biological constraints. libRCGA employs stochastic ranking to efficiently solve constrained optimization problems. In the present paper, we demonstrate the performance of libRCGA through benchmark problems and in realistic parameter estimation problems. libRCGA is freely available for academic usage at http://kurata21.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/maeda/index.html."

  "description": "Regie over InnovatieRegie over innovatie demystificeert innovatie, maakt het behapbaar en stelt de haalbaarheid van innovatiedoelen centraal, zonder voorbij te gaan aan de complexiteit ervan. Het uitgangspunt is dat innovatie bestuurbaar, organiseerbaar en realiseerbaar is. Vernieuwing is geen toeval en kan door iedereen en in elke organisatie gerealiseerd worden. Over de manieren waarop innovatiesucces kan worden bereikt, gaat HET boek. Het gebruikt hierbij het beeld van een regisseerbaar speelveld, waarin zes posities centraal staan en waarbij de opstelling van deze posities het innovatiesucces bepaalt. Juist bij innovatieprojecten is het de uitdaging om doelen zo concreet mogelijk te verwoorden en vast te leggen. De doelen moeten aansluiten bij de innovatiestrategie van de onderneming die als richtinggever voor het innovatieproject fungeert. Innovatieteams moeten leren nieuwe, innovatieve idee\u00ebn kritisch op realiteitszin te screenen. Dit betekent dat je idee\u00ebn moet kunnen zeven, moet kunnen laten vallen en je moet kunnen concentreren op het waarmaken van de idee\u00ebn met de meeste potentie. Een positieve, daadkrachtige aanpak staat daarbij centraal: Succesvolle innovatieteams leren door vallen en opstaan. Een succesvol innovatieteam bestaat uit specialisten en professionals met verschillende achtergronden. Alleen samen zijn zij in staat tot het cre\u00ebren van het nieuwe, en daarom is het belangrijk dat iedereen zich veilig kan voelen om bij te dragen aan het succes van de organisatie door te innoveren, heel concreet en tastbaar, heel down-to-earth. Het boek reikt veel instrumenten en aanpakken aan die hun waarde in de praktijk hebben bewezen en waarmee je je kunt ontwikkelen tot regisseur van het innovatiespeelveld en daadwerkelijk de Regie over innovatie kunt nemen."

  "description": "Clinical Metabolomics: Expanding the Metabolome Coverage Using Advanced Analytical TechniquesMetabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of all metabolites and intermediate products of reactions present within a biological system, is a promising field to enable precision medicine. Clinical metabolomics faces two main challenges at the bioanalytical level. The first is the need for high resolution to obtain maximum metabolome coverage. This is exemplified by the latest version of the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), which reports more than 110,000 metabolites and endogenous compounds. The second is the high-throughput needed to enable the analysis of a large number of samples typically encountered in large-scale cohort studies. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) at regular or ultrahigh pressures combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has long been considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d in metabolomics. However, these conventional reversed-phase LC\u2013MS approaches are no longer sufficient to analyze the vast variety of polar compounds, as well as discriminate closely related compounds such as isomers or enantiomers. This review article discusses the novel separation and detection strategies that are considered promising in clinical metabolomics to enhance the metabolome coverage. It includes hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), multidimensional LC approaches, as well as ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis methods."

  "description": "Not (Only) reversed-phase lc\u2013ms: Alternative lc\u2013ms approachesElectrospray ionization (ESI) and other ambient ionization techniques have allowed a successful interface between liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The coupling of these two high-resolution techniques has fostered the use of analytical science in various fields, including, but not limited to, the clinical, pharmaceutical, and forensic fields, enabling the analysis, identification, and characterization of thousands of molecular components in a large diversity of complex mixtures. For many years, reversed-phase LC has remained the most commonly adopted chromatographic mode, due to its rather straightforward applicability to the analysis of a wide variety of compounds (from small to large molecules), as well as its direct compatibility with ESI-MS. However, reversed-phase LC\u2013MS has shown relevant limitations in a number of analytical applications. This encouraged the development of alternative MS-compatible chromatographic techniques, including hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), ion-exchange chromatography (IEC), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), which provide analyte separation in the liquid phase based on different retention mechanisms compared with reversed-phase LC. Here, we present these alternative chromatographic approaches, highlighting the recent relevant applications in various fields, and discussing their potential in future of analytical science investigations."

  "description": "Association of lysophosphatidic acids with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and progression to Alzheimer's diseaseBACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are bioactive signaling phospholipids that have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is largely unknown whether LPAs are associated with AD pathology and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.METHODS: The current study was performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples of 182 MCI patients from two independent cohorts. We profiled LPA-derived metabolites using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We evaluated the association of LPAs with CSF biomarkers of AD, A\u03b2-42, p-tau, and total tau levels overall and stratified by APOE genotype and with MCI to AD progression.RESULTS: Five LPAs (C16:0, C16:1, C22:4, C22:6, and isomer-LPA C22:5) showed significant positive association with CSF biomarkers of AD, A\u03b2-42, p-tau, and total tau, while LPA C14:0 and C20:1 associated only with A\u03b2-42 and alkyl-LPA C18:1, and LPA C20:1 associated with tau pathology biomarkers. Association of cyclic-LPA C16:0 and two LPAs (C20:4, C22:4) with A\u03b2-42 levels was found only in APOE \u03b54 carriers. Furthermore, LPA C16:0 and C16:1 also showed association with MCI to AD dementia progression, but results did not replicate in an independent cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that LPAs may contribute to early AD pathogenesis. Future studies are needed to determine whether LPAs play a role in upstream of AD pathology or are downstream markers of neurodegeneration."

  "description": "Association of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants and children's behavior at a median age of 18 monthsExposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants (FRs) could have adverse effects on neurodevelopment in children. Some organophosphate (OPFRs) are used as alternatives for the phased-out decabromodiphenylether such as resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate (PBDPP) and bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate (BPA-BDPP). This study aims to investigate the relationship between indoor OPFR exposure and neurodevelopmental behavior in children. OPFRs were measured in house dust and hand wipes from 42 children, aged 8-16 months, from the LInking maternal Nutrition to Child health (LINC) study. At the median age of 18 months, the children's behavior was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, using three composite behavior scales: externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and total problems. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for maternal education and smoking by the partner. Children with higher BPA-BDPP, PBDPP, and tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) house dust concentrations were found to have higher scores on the behavioral problems scales. A 10-fold increase in BPA-BDPP and PBDPP concentration was associated with a 4.1 and 2.6 point increase on the internalizing problems scale (respectively p=0.004 and p=0.042). Increased BPA-BDPP concentrations were associated with elevated scores on the externalizing problems scale and total behavioral problems scale (respectively 7.6 and 16 points increase per 10-fold BPA-BDPP concentration increase, p=0.015 and p=0.007). TCEP dust concentrations were associated with the externalizing problems scale (13 point increase per 10-fold TCEP concentration increase, p=0.043). This study showed the importance of investigating the health effects of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants. Further research on neurodevelopmental health effects of OPFR exposure is warranted."

  "title": "Progress towards an OECD reporting framework for transcriptomics and metabolomics in regulatory toxicology\u00a9 2021Omics methodologies are widely used in toxicological research to understand modes and mechanisms of toxicity. Increasingly, these methodologies are being applied to questions of regulatory interest such as molecular point-of-departure derivation and chemical grouping/read-across. Despite its value, widespread regulatory acceptance of omics data has not yet occurred. Barriers to the routine application of omics data in regulatory decision making have been: 1) lack of transparency for data processing methods used to convert raw data into an interpretable list of observations; and 2) lack of standardization in reporting to ensure that omics data, associated metadata and the methodologies used to generate results are available for review by stakeholders, including regulators. Thus, in 2017, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Extended Advisory Group on Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics (EAGMST) launched a project to develop guidance for the reporting of omics data aimed at fostering further regulatory use. Here, we report on the ongoing development of the first formal reporting framework describing the processing and analysis of both transcriptomic and metabolomic data for regulatory toxicology. We introduce the modular structure, content, harmonization and strategy for trialling this reporting framework prior to its publication by the OECD.General information",

  "description": "Progress towards an OECD reporting framework for transcriptomics and metabolomics in regulatory toxicology\u00a9 2021Omics methodologies are widely used in toxicological research to understand modes and mechanisms of toxicity. Increasingly, these methodologies are being applied to questions of regulatory interest such as molecular point-of-departure derivation and chemical grouping/read-across. Despite its value, widespread regulatory acceptance of omics data has not yet occurred. Barriers to the routine application of omics data in regulatory decision making have been: 1) lack of transparency for data processing methods used to convert raw data into an interpretable list of observations; and 2) lack of standardization in reporting to ensure that omics data, associated metadata and the methodologies used to generate results are available for review by stakeholders, including regulators. Thus, in 2017, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Extended Advisory Group on Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics (EAGMST) launched a project to develop guidance for the reporting of omics data aimed at fostering further regulatory use. Here, we report on the ongoing development of the first formal reporting framework describing the processing and analysis of both transcriptomic and metabolomic data for regulatory toxicology. We introduce the modular structure, content, harmonization and strategy for trialling this reporting framework prior to its publication by the OECD."

  "description": "Building bridges: The role of authenticity in academic educationUniversities educate students in various disciplines, so as to go to work in society with an academic frame of mind. However, only a fraction of students pursue an academic career; the majority end up in business, government or the non-profit sector. These non-academic worlds, also known as business systems, are fundamentally different economic organisations. Although academia is typically non-vocational, we want to properly prepare students for the job-market by bridging the gap between the world of science and the world of business, while realising that each of these worlds has its own logic. The overarching logic of the world of science is to contribute to our collective body of knowledge, while the overarching logic of the world of business is to make money. Many bridges have been suggested and built; in this article, we build a bridge from an educational perspective."

  "description": "Predicting Multicomponent Adsorption Isotherms in Open-Metal Site Materials Using Force Field Calculations Based on Energy Decomposed Density Functional TheoryFor the design of adsorptive-separation units, knowledge is required of the multicomponent adsorption behavior. Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) breaks down for olefin adsorption in open-metal site (OMS) materials due to non-ideal donor\u2013acceptor interactions. Using a density-function-theory-based energy decomposition scheme, we develop a physically justifiable classical force field that incorporates the missing orbital interactions using an appropriate functional form. Our first-principles derived force field shows greatly improved quantitative agreement with the inflection points, initial uptake, saturation capacity, and enthalpies of adsorption obtained from our in-house adsorption experiments. While IAST fails to make accurate predictions, our improved force field model is able to correctly predict the multicomponent behavior. Our approach is also transferable to other OMS structures, allowing the accurate study of their separation performances for olefins/paraffins and further mixtures involving complex donor\u2013acceptor interactions."

Alterations in neurobehavior and immune functions are also affected by phthalate exposure and may be linked to the metabolic changes caused by developmental exposure to DEHP. Objectives: Our goal was to study the effects of developmental exposure to DEHP in the context of metabolic syndrome by integrating different parameters to assess metabolic, neurobehavioral, and immune functions in one model. Methods: Female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEHP through the diet during gestation and lactation at doses ranging from 3.3 to 100,000 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day (\u03bckd). During a 1-year follow-up period, a wide set of metabolic parameters was assessed in the F1 offspring, including weekly body weight measurements, food consumption, physical activity, glucose homeostasis, serum lipids, and endocrine profile. In addition, neurobehavioral and immune functions were assessed by sweet preference test, object recognition test, acute phase protein, and cytokines production. Animals were challenged with a high fat diet (HFD) in the last 9 weeks of the study. Results: Increased free fatty acids (FFA) and, high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) were observed in serum, together with a decrease in glycated hemoglobin levels in blood of 1-year old male DEHP-exposed offspring after HFD challenge. For the most sensitive endpoint measured (FFA), a lower bound of the 90%-confidence interval for benchmark dose (BMD) at a critical effect size of 5% (BMDL) of 2,160 \u03bckd was calculated. No persistent changes in body weight or fat mass were observed. At 33,000 \u03bckd altered performance was found in the object recognition test in males and changes in interferon (IFN)\u03b3 production were observed in females. Conclusions: Developmental exposure to DEHP combined with HFD in adulthood led to changes in lipid metabolism and neurobehavior in male offspring and cytokine production in female offspring. Our findings contribute to the evidence that DEHP is a developmental dyslipidemic chemical, however, more research is needed to further characterize adverse health outcomes and the mechanisms of action associated with the observed sex-specific effects."

The two applied methods were multireference com- plete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) including the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian with all-electron basis sets and density functional theory with the B3LYP exchange- correlation functional in conjunction with relativistic pseudopotentials. Beside the ground electronic states, the excited states up to 17 000 cm 1 have been determined. The molecular properties explored included the ground-state geometries, bonding properties, and the electronic absorption spectra. According to the occupation of the bonding orbitals, the calculated electronic states were classified into three groups, each leading to a characteristic bond distance range for the equilibrium geometry. The ground states of ThC, UC, and PuC have two doubly occupied \u03c0 orbitals resulting in short bond distances between 1.8 and 2.0 \u00c5, whereas the ground state of AmC has significant occupation of the antibonding orbitals, causing a bond distance of 2.15 \u00c5."

  "description": "Concept for a generic information strategy for PBT and vPvB assessement of UVCB substancesWithin the context of the European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemicals) Regulation, the SVHC Roadmap aims to identify the highest priority potential substances of very high concern (SVHC) before 2020. With regard to environmental concerns, substances will be assessed for persistency, bioaccumulation, and toxicity (PBT) properties. One group of substances which are more difficult to assess for PBT properties are the UVCBs: substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products or biological materials. This report aims to set a first step in the process of developing a generic information strategy for the PBT assessment of UVCBs. Two examples of UVCB substances are used in this report to illustrate specific parts of the information strategy: petroleum and coal stream (PetCo) substances and chlorinated paraffines.The proposed strategy is based on current guidance documents, experience from case studies, and current state of science. The concept follows two lines of evidence: a constituents approach and a substance approach. The first line is based on the identification of the constituents of the UVCB, followed by grouping (blocks) of constituents with similar properties (e.g. physico-chemical, fate, mode of action), and the selection of representative structures for each block. The representative structures are individually assessed for PBT properties using in silico predictions and experimental work. In general, the characterisation of the exact molecular structure of constituents in UVCB substances is challenging or extremely time consuming due to the complexity of the mixtures, even with the latest analytical techniques available. However, for most UVCBs generic structures of the constituents can be generated. This generic structures can be used for blocking constituents with similar properties and to generate representative structures for each block. It is therefore suggested that the generation of generic structures can be used as a first tier assessment of UVCBs. Yet, if information on specific constituents with potential PBT properties are available these should be assessed as well. Predictions of the physico-chemical properties of the representative structures together with (Q)SAR PBT models are then used for the PBT assessment. This information can further guide the experimental work on representative structures and therefore reduce animal testing. Together with the whole substance testing it provides weight-of-evidence on the PBT properties of the UVCB substance. The second line assesses the UVCB substance as a whole, which can be followed by fractionation of the substance in fractions before experimental testing. With the later concept the main challenges are in the testing methodologies as many UVCB substances are hydrophobic and therefore alternative testing methods are needed.In this concept there are a number of challenges which are in the field of i) testing methodologies, ii) the applicability domain of the in silico models, and iii) each UVCB will have its own specific challenges and therefore a case-by case approach is needed. The current momentum on the development of the strategies for UVCB assessment needs multi-stakeholder involvement from regulators, industry and academia. "

  "description": "MMP activation associated Aminopeptidase N reveals a bivalent 14-3-3 binding motifAminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) is a trans-membrane ectopeptidase involved in many crucial cellular functions. Besides its role as a peptidase, APN also mediates signal transduction, and is involved in the activation of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs function in tissue remodeling within the extracellular space and are therefore involved in many human diseases such as fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis as well as viral infections. However, the exact mechanism that leads to APN driven MMP activation is unclear. It was previously shown that extracellular 14-3-3 adapter proteins binding APN induces the transcription of MMPs. As a first step, we sought to identify potential 14\u20113\u20113 binding sites in the APN sequence. We constructed a set of phosphorylated peptides derived from APN to probe for interactions. We identified and characterized a canonical 14-3-3 binding site (site 1) within the flexible, structurally unresolved N-terminal APN region using direct binding Fluorescence Polarization (FP) assays and thermodynamic analysis (ITC). In addition, we identified a secondary, non-canonical binding site (site 2), which enhances the binding affinity in combination with site 1 by many orders of magnitude. Finally, we solved crystal structures of 14\u20113\u20113\u03c3 bound to mono- and bis\u2011phosphorylated APN derived peptides, which revealed atomic details of the binding mode of mono- and bivalent 14-3-3 interactions. Therefore, our findings shed some light on the first steps of APN-mediated MMP activation and opens the field for further investigation of this important signaling pathway."

  "description": "Predicting the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders with knowledge graphsGut microbiota produce and modulate the production of neurotransmitters which have been implicated in mental disorders. Neurotransmitters may act as 'matchmaker' between gut microbiota imbalance and mental disorders. Most of the relevant research effort goes into the relationship between gut microbiota and neurotransmitters and the other between neurotransmitters and mental disorders, while few studies collect and analyze the dispersed research results in systematic ways. We therefore gather the dispersed results that in the existing studies into a structured knowledge base for identifying and predicting the potential relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders. In this study, we propose to construct a gut microbiota knowledge graph for mental disorder, which named as MiKG4MD. It is extendable by linking to future ontologies by just adding new relationships between existing information and new entities. This extendibility is emphasized for the integration with existing popular ontologies/terminologies, e.g. UMLS, MeSH, and KEGG. We demonstrate the performance of MiKG4MD with three SPARQL query test cases. Results show that the MiKG4MD knowledge graph is an effective method to predict the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders."

  "title": "Elevated plasma succinate levels are linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk factors in young adults\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).Background: Succinate is produced by both host and microbiota, with a key role in the interplay of immunity and metabolism and an emerging role as a biomarker for inflammatory and metabolic disorders in middle-aged adults. The relationship between plasma succinate levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in young adults is unknown. Methods: Cross-sectional study in 100 (65% women) individuals aged 18\u201325 years from the ACTIvating Brown Adipose Tissue through Exercise (ACTIBATE) study cohort. CVD risk factors, body composition, dietary intake, basal metabolic rate, and cardiorespiratory fitness were assessed by routine methods. Plasma succinate was measured with an enzyme-based assay. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated by positron emission tomography, and circulating oxylipins were assessed by targeted metabolomics. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed in a sub-sample. Results: Individuals with higher succinate levels had higher levels of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass (+ 42.5%), triglycerides (+ 63.9%), C-reactive protein (+ 124.2%), diastolic blood pressure (+ 5.5%), and pro-inflammatory omega-6 oxylipins than individuals with lower succinate levels. Succinate levels were also higher in metabolically unhealthy individuals than in healthy overweight/obese peers. Succinate levels were not associated with BAT volume or activity or with fecal microbiota composition and diversity. Conclusions: Plasma succinate levels are linked to a specific pro-inflammatory omega-6 signature pattern and higher VAT levels, and seem to reflect the cardiovascular status of young adults.General information",

  "description": "Elevated plasma succinate levels are linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk factors in young adults\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).Background: Succinate is produced by both host and microbiota, with a key role in the interplay of immunity and metabolism and an emerging role as a biomarker for inflammatory and metabolic disorders in middle-aged adults. The relationship between plasma succinate levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in young adults is unknown. Methods: Cross-sectional study in 100 (65% women) individuals aged 18\u201325 years from the ACTIvating Brown Adipose Tissue through Exercise (ACTIBATE) study cohort. CVD risk factors, body composition, dietary intake, basal metabolic rate, and cardiorespiratory fitness were assessed by routine methods. Plasma succinate was measured with an enzyme-based assay. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated by positron emission tomography, and circulating oxylipins were assessed by targeted metabolomics. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed in a sub-sample. Results: Individuals with higher succinate levels had higher levels of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass (+ 42.5%), triglycerides (+ 63.9%), C-reactive protein (+ 124.2%), diastolic blood pressure (+ 5.5%), and pro-inflammatory omega-6 oxylipins than individuals with lower succinate levels. Succinate levels were also higher in metabolically unhealthy individuals than in healthy overweight/obese peers. Succinate levels were not associated with BAT volume or activity or with fecal microbiota composition and diversity. Conclusions: Plasma succinate levels are linked to a specific pro-inflammatory omega-6 signature pattern and higher VAT levels, and seem to reflect the cardiovascular status of young adults."

  "title": "Physiological and interactomic analysis reveals versatile functions of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 quadruple mutants in response to Fe deficiency\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).To date, few phenotypes have been described for Arabidopsis 14-3-3 mutants or the phenotypes showing the role of 14-3-3 in plant responding to abiotic stress. Although one member of the 14-3-3 protein family (14-3-3 omicron) was shown to be involved in the proper operation of Fe acquisition mechanisms at physiological and gene expression levels in Arabidopsis thaliana, it remains to be explored whether other members play a role in regulating iron acquisition. To more directly and effectively observe whether members of 14-3-3 non-epsilon group have a function in Fe-deficiency adaptation, three higher order quadruple KOs, kappa/lambda/phi/chi (klpc), kappa/lambda/upsilon/nu(klun), and upsilon/nu/phi/chi (unpc) were generated and studied for physiological analysis in this study. The analysis of iron-utilization efficiency, root phenotyping, and transcriptional level of Fe-responsive genes suggested that the mutant with kl background showed different phenotypes from Wt when plants suffered Fe starved, while these phenotypes were absent in the unpc mutant. Moreover, the absence of the four 14-3-3 isoforms in the klun mutant has a clear impact on the 14-3-3 interactome upon Fe deficiency. Dynamics of 14-3-3-client interactions analysis showed that 27 and 17 proteins differentially interacted with 14-3-3 in Wt and klun roots caused by Fe deficiency, respectively. Many of these Fe responsive proteins have a role in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle, the Fo",

Many of these Fe responsive proteins have a role in glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle, the FoF1-synthase and in the cysteine/methionine synthesis. A clear explanation for the observed phenotypes awaits a more detailed analysis of the functional aspects of 14-3-3 binding to the target proteins identified in this study."
