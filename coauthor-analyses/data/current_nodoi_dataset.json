  "description": "Challenging the Lieb-Oxford bound in a systematic wayThe Lieb\u2013Oxford bound, a nontrivial inequality for the indirect part of the many-body Coulomb repulsion in an electronic system, plays an important role in the construction of approximations in density functional theory. Using the wave function for strictly correlated electrons of a given density, we turn the search over wave functions appearing in the original bound into a more manageable search over electron densities. This allows us to challenge the bound in a systematic way. We find that a maximising density for the bound, if it exists, must have compact support. We also find that, at least for particle numbers N \u2264 60, a uniform density profile is not the most challenging for the bound. With our construction, we improve the bound for N = 2 electrons that was originally found by Lieb and Oxford, we give a new lower bound to the constant appearing in the Lieb\u2013Oxford inequality valid for any N, and we provide an improved upper bound for the low-density uniform electron gas indirect energy."

  "description": "Constraint-based models of microbial physiology: Surprisingly versatileMicrobial cells evolved a remarkable ability to adapt to environmental conditions, or to withstand otherwise detrimental mutations, which makes them often very resilient to man-made interventions. These properties arise from the integrative functioning of biological networks. Functional genomics has allowed the cost-effective measurement of the network components; however, we still mostly fail to understand how their interactions lead to cellular function and adaptation. For this, modeling is required. Current mainstream constraint-based metabolic modeling efforts largely focus on the metabolic network only, albeit at genome-scale. They are based on reaction stoichiometry only, but nonetheless can be extremely valuable for mostly exploratory analysis of the metabolic potential of an organism. However, because these \u201cFlux Balance Analysis\u201d (FBA) methods lack important parts of the cell \u2013with their associated constraints- they often fail to predict changes in common regulatory strategies. One view that is becoming dominant in cellular physiology, is that physical and (bio)chemical constraints limits protein content and synthesis, impacting on how resources are partitioned over growth and stress processes to optimize fitness (\u201ccellular economics\u201d). Such constraints can lead to (evolutionary) trade-offs and can explain a large number of microbial physiological phenomena, such as overflow metabolism or catabolite repression. Current efforts in the modeling field aim to include such resource constraints into the constraint-based modeling format. We have developed theory to understand what the solution is to a flux maximization problem under resource constraints. We found that Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs), mathematical definitions of minimal patways, are the flux maximisers. Although the number of EFMs is enormous (in the millions), the number of active constraints determines the maximum number of active EFMs at optimum. So complexity of the flux space seems to be determined by the constraints, not by the seemingly infinite possibilities. Still, the resource allocation perspective is developed for steady-state growth under constant environments. What happens during dynamic growth conditions is largely unexplored. Such analysis requires dynamic models, one of which is dynamic FBA. We conclude that the constraint-based modeling approach is a powerful and versatile approach to explain the physiology of a cell through the interactions of its molecular components and the governing physico-chemical and biochemical constraints."

  "description": "Avoiding the 4-index transformation in one-body reduced density matrix functional calculations for separable functionalsOne of the major computational bottlenecks in one-body reduced density matrix (1RDM) functional theory is the evaluation of approximate 1RDM functionals and their derivatives. The reason is that more advanced approximate functionals are almost exclusively defined in the natural orbital basis, so a 4-index transformation of the two-electron integrals appears to be unavoidable. I will show that this is not the case and that so-called separable functionals can be evaluated much more efficiently, i.e. only at cubic cost in the basis size. Since most approximate functionals are actually separable, this new algorithm is an important development to make 1RDM functional theory calculations feasible for large electronic systems."

Here, we include the entropic and enthalpic contributions of the hydrophobic effect explicitly in an implicit solvent model. This allows us to capture two important effects: a length-scale dependence and a temperature dependence for the solvation of a hydrophobic particle. This consistent treatment of the hydrophobic effect explains cold denaturation and heat capacity measurements of solvated proteins."

  "description": "Een praktische gids voor probiotica ter preventie van antibiotica-gerelateerde diarree in NederlandBACKGROUND Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a side-effect frequently associated with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although a number of clinical studies show that co-administration of specific probiotics reduces the risk for AAD, there is still unclarity among healthcare professionals on the recommendation of probiotic products. OBJECTIVE This paper aims to provide a practical guide to inform healthcare professionals, patients and consumers about the exact product characteristics of available probiotics with a proven efficacy to prevent AAD. DESIGN and METHODS The workflow in this paper includes three consecutive steps: a systematic review of relevant clinical studies for effective probiotics by a meta-analysis, compilation of a list of available probiotic products, and recommendation of probiotic products that match effective formulations. Our systematic review on the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD included only studies with randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trials, a clear definition of antibiotic associated diarrhea, and a probiotic administration regime for at least the duration of the antibiotic therapy. RESULTS Using our inclusion criteria, we selected 32 out of 128 identified trials and pooled the results of these studies for each specific dairy product and food supplement. The results indicate a total of seven single or multiple-strain formulations favoring the probiotic treatment group, with the strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG being the most effective (relative risk ratio of probiotic versus placebo 0.30 with 95% CI 0.16 - 0.5]. We selected products for recommendation from a compiled list of all probiotic dairy products and food supplements available in The Netherlands and categorized them into groups of products showing effects against the incidence of AAD in at least one, two, or three independent clinical studies. We excluded all products which did not unambiguously declare on the label the specific probiotic strain(s) and the number of colony forming units. CONCLUSION Here, we present a practical guide that informs healthcare professionals and patients on the availability of probiotic products with a proven efficacy for the prevention of AAD."

  "description": "Protein cost allocation explains metabolic strategies in Escherichia coliIn-depth understanding of microbial growth is crucial for the development of new advances in biotechnology and for combating microbial pathogens. Condition-specific proteome expression is central to microbial physiology and growth. A multitude of processes are dependent on the protein expression, thus, whole-cell analysis of microbial metabolism using genome-scale metabolic models is an attractive toolset to investigate the behaviour of microorganisms and their communities. However, genome-scale models that incorporate macromolecular expression are still inhibitory complex: the conceptual and computational complexity of these models severely limits their potential applications. In the need for alternatives, here we revisit some of the previous attempts to create genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression to develop a novel framework for integrating protein abundance and turnover costs to conventional genome-scale models. We show that such a model of Escherichia coli successfully reproduces experimentally determined adaptations of metabolism in a growth condition-dependent manner. Moreover, the model can be used as means of investigating underutilization of the protein machinery among different growth settings. Notably, we obtained strongly improved predictions of flux distributions, considering the costs of protein translation explicitly. This finding in turn suggests protein translation being the main regulation hub for cellular growth."

  "description": "Effect of metallation, substituents and inter/intra-molecular polarization on electronic couplings for hole transport in stacked porphyrin dyadsWe carried out a systematic study of the hole transport properties for a series of symmetrically stacked porphyrin dimers. In the first part of this study, we evaluated the sensitivity of electronic couplings to orbital relaxation due to molecular ionization and intermolecular interactions for a series of halogenated porphyrins. The effect of polarization was estimated by comparing electronic couplings from fragment orbital density functional theory (FODFT) and frozen density embedding electron transfer (FDE-CT). For the dimers considered, the effect of polarization was estimated to be less than 20%, in line with previous studies on different molecular dimers. Thus, we decided to employ a computationally cheaper FODFT method to continue our study of the effect of metals and substituents on the electronic couplings for hole transfer. We find that, compared to the non-metallated porphyrins, Ni, Fe and Pt significantly reduce the coupling, while Zn, Ti, Cd and Pd increase it. The effect of substituents was studied on a series of meso-substituted porphyrins (meso-tetrapyridineporphyrin, meso-tetraphenylporphyrin and derivatives) for which we could relate a reduction of the coupling to steric effects that reduce the overlap between the frontier orbitals of the monomers."

  "description": "Time-dependent Dyson orbital theoryAlthough time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has become the tool of choice for real-time propagation of the electron density \u03c1N(t) of N-electron systems, it also encounters problems in this application. The first problem is the neglect of memory effects stemming from the, in TDDFT virtually unavoidable, adiabatic approximation, the second problem is the reliable evaluation of the probabilities Pn(t) of multiple photoinduced ionization, while the third problem (which TDDFT shares with other approaches) is the reliable description of continuum states of the electrons ejected in the process of ionization. In this paper time-dependent Dyson orbital theory (TDDOT) is proposed. Exact TDDOT equations of motion (EOMs) for time-dependent Dyson orbitals are derived, which are linear differential equations with just static, feasible potentials of the electron\u2013electron interaction. No adiabatic approximation is used, which formally resolves the first TDDFT problem. TDDOT offers formally exact expressions for the complete evolution in time of the wavefunction of the outgoing electron. This leads to the correlated probability of single ionization P1(t) as well as the probabilities of no ionization (P0(t)) and multiple ionization of n electrons, Pn(t), which formally solves the second problem of TDDFT. For two-electron systems a proper description of the required continuum states appears to be rather straightforward, and both P1(t) and P2(t) can be calculated. Because of the exact formulation, TDDOT is expected to reproduce a notorious memory effect, the \u201cknee structure\u201d of the non-sequential double ionization of the He atom."

  "description": "Corporate-NGO partnership for environmentally sustainable innovation: Lessons from a cross-sector collaboration in aviation biofuelsThis paper studies the initiation of a partnership between a corporation and a nongovernmental organization (NGO) for environmentally sustainable innovation, as well as its development over time. Proceeding from a dynamic capabilities approach, it provides a retrospective, longitudinal examination of a 10-year partnership between KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) and the World Wildlife Fund for Nature Netherlands (WNF), which promoted a market for aviation biofuels. The case study suggests that the progress of the partnership is determined by three specific dynamic capabilities of KLM and WNF: learning, coordination, and reconfiguration. The results reveal two microfoundations for each of these dynamic capabilities. For learning, these microfoundations are the sensing of strategic partners and the co-specialization of resources. For coordination, these consist of finding a fit between partners and having an integrated mission. Finally, the microfoundations of reconfiguration are the fostering of an institutional dialogue and the setting of new industry standards. This study is beneficial to scholars as it opens a research avenue concerning the dynamic capabilities and microfoundations that support corporate-NGO partnering for environmentally sustainable innovation. Practitioners can use these dynamic capabilities and microfoundations as guidelines for developing their own specific corporate-NGO partnerships."

  "description": "Network medicine framework shows that proximity of polyphenol targets and disease proteins predicts therapeutic effects of polyphenolsPolyphenols, natural products present in plant-based foods, play a protective role against several complex diseases through their antioxidant activity and by diverse molecular mechanisms. Here we develop a network medicine framework to uncover mechanisms for the effects of polyphenols on health by considering the molecular interactions between polyphenol protein targets and proteins associated with diseases. We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighbourhoods of the human interactome, whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the molecule\u2019s known therapeutic effects. The methodology recovers known associations, such as the effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on type 2 diabetes, and predicts that rosmarinic acid has a direct impact on platelet function, representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health. We experimentally confirm that rosmarinic acid inhibits platelet aggregation and \u03b1-granule secretion through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, offering direct support for the predicted molecular mechanism. Our framework represents a starting point for mechanistic interpretation of the health effects underlying food-related compounds, allowing us to integrate into a predictive framework knowledge on food metabolism, bioavailability and drug interaction. Molecular interactions between polyphenol targets and proteins associated with disease are explored through a network medicine framework. The network proximity of polyphenol protein targets to disease proteins can predict therapeutic effects, highlighting more broadly the potential of network medicine as a tool for nutritional sciences."

It became clear that the inclusion of information to enhance discussions among this mix of participants would be even more valuable. The present version retains a chemical structure theme while expanding tutorial comments that aim to bridge the various perspectives that may arise during interdisciplinary communications about a given term.

  "description": "Implementation of Zebrafish Ontologies for Toxicology ScreeningToxicological evaluation of chemicals using early-life stage zebrafish (Danio rerio) involves the observation and recording of altered phenotypes. Substantial variability has been observed among researchers in phenotypes reported from similar studies, as well as a lack of consistent data annotation, indicating a need for both terminological and data harmonization. When examined from a data science perspective, many of these apparent differences can be parsed into the same or similar endpoints whose measurements differ only in time, methodology, or nomenclature. Ontological knowledge structures can be leveraged to integrate diverse data sets across terminologies, scales, and modalities. Building on this premise, the National Toxicology Program\u2019s Systematic Evaluation of the Application of Zebrafish in Toxicology undertook a collaborative exercise to evaluate how the application of standardized phenotype terminology improved data consistency. To accomplish this, zebrafish researchers were asked to assess images of zebrafish larvae for morphological malformations in two surveys. In the first survey, researchers were asked to annotate observed malformations using their own terminology. In the second survey, researchers were asked to annotate the images from a list of terms and definitions from the Zebrafish Phenotype Ontology. Analysis of the results suggested that the use of ontology terms increased consistency and decreased ambiguity, but a larger study is needed to confirm. We conclude that utilizing a common data standard will not only reduce the heterogeneity of reported terms but increases agreement and repeatability between different laboratories. Thus, we advocate for the development of a zebrafish phenotype atlas to help laboratories create interoperable, computable data."

  "description": "Extending the Impact of RAC1b Overexpression to Follicular Thyroid CarcinomasRAC1b is a hyperactive variant of the small GTPase RAC1 known to be a relevant molecular player in different cancers. Previous studies from our group lead to the evidence that its overexpression in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. In the present study, we intended to extend the analysis of RAC1b expression to thyroid follicular neoplasms and to seek for clinical correlations. RAC1b expression levels were determined by RT-qPCR in thyroid follicular tumor samples comprising 23 follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTCs) and 33 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTAs). RAC1b was found to be overexpressed in 33% of carcinomas while no RAC1b overexpression was documented among follicular adenomas. Patients with a diagnosis of FTC were divided into two groups based on longitudinal evolution and final outcome. RAC1b overexpression was significantly associated with both the presence of distant metastases (P = 0.01) and poorer clinical outcome (P = 0.01) suggesting that, similarly to that previously found in PTCs, RAC1b overexpression in FTCs is also associated with worse outcomes. Furthermore, the absence of RAC1b overexpression in follicular adenomas hints its potential as a molecular marker likely to contribute, in conjunction with other putative markers, to the preoperative differential diagnosis of thyroid follicular lesions."

  "description": "Synthesis and Hydrolysis of Alkoxy(aminoalkyl)diorganylsilanes of the Formula Type R2(RO)Si(CH2)(n)NH2 (R = Alkyl, n=1-3): A Systematic Experimental and Computational StudyAlkoxy(aminoalkyl)silanes are important precursors for the formation of amino-functionalized polysiloxanes, which are used in many technical applications. To better understand the mechanism of the hydrolytic cleavage of the Si\u2013alkoxy moiety of alkoxy(aminoalkyl)silanes (an important key step in the formation of amino-functionalized polysiloxanes), a systematic experimental and computational study on the hydrolysis of alkoxy(aminoalkyl)diorganylsilanes of the formula type R2(RO)Si(CH2)nNH2 (R = alkyl, n = 1\u20133) was conducted. For reasons of comparison, silanes of the formula types R2(RO)SiC(H)MeCH2NH2 and R2(RO)Si(CH2)nX [R = alkyl; n = 1\u20133; X = N(H)Me, NMe2, piperidino, NMe3+I\u2013, N(H)COOMe, N(Me)COOMe] and compounds Me2(MeO)Si(CH2)6Me and Me2(MeO)Si(CH2)6NH2 were included in this study. For this purpose, the various silanes were synthesized and studied for their hydrolysis kinetics in CD3CN/D2O under acidic and basic conditions by using 1H NMR spectroscopy as the analytic tool. These experimental investigations were complemented by computational studies (calculation of proton affinities, reaction barriers, and energies relative to reactants of intermediate transition complexes). The different hydrolysis reactivities observed are the result of a number of parameters, such as electronic and steric effects, the strong impact of the pD value, and intramolecular N\u2013H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O hydrogen bonds between the protonated amino group and the alkoxy leaving group. This comprehensive study provided deep insight into the mechanism of hydrolysis of analogous \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-amino-functionalized alkoxy(aminoalkyl)diorganylsilanes of the formula type R2(RO)Si(CH2)nNH2 (R = organyl, n = 1\u20133) and a series of related \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 analogues with other nitrogen-based functional groups."

  "description": "Exchange\u2013Correlation Functionals via Local Interpolation along the Adiabatic ConnectionThe construction of density-functional approximations is explored by modeling the adiabatic connection locally, using energy densities defined in terms of the electrostatic potential of the exchange\u2013correlation hole. These local models are more amenable to the construction of size-consistent approximations than their global counterparts. In this work we use accurate input local ingredients to assess the accuracy of a range of local interpolation models against accurate exchange\u2013correlation energy densities. The importance of the strictly correlated electrons (SCE) functional describing the strong coupling limit is emphasized, enabling the corresponding interpolated functionals to treat strong correlation effects. In addition to exploring the performance of such models numerically for the helium and beryllium isoelectronic series and the dissociation of the hydrogen molecule, an approximate analytic model is presented for the initial slope of the local adiabatic connection. Comparisons are made with approaches based on global models, and prospects for future approximations based on the local adiabatic connection are discussed."

  "description": "Cooperative Self-Assembly in Linear Chains Based on Halogen Bonds\u00a9 2021 The Authors. ChemPlusChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbHCooperative properties of halogen bonds were investigated with computational experiments based on dispersion-corrected relativistic density functional theory. The bonding mechanism in linear chains of cyanogen halide (X\u2212CN), halocyanoacetylene (X\u2212CC\u2212CN), and 4-halobenzonitrile (X\u2212C6H4\u2212CN) were examined for X = H, Cl, Br, and I. Our energy decomposition and Kohn-Sham molecular-orbital analyses revealed the bonding mechanism of the studied systems. Cyanogen halide and halocyanoacetylene chains possess an extra stabilizing effect with increasing chain size, whereas the 4-halobenzonitrile chains do not. This cooperativity can be traced back to charge separation within the \u03c3-electronic system by charge-transfer between the lone-pair orbital of the nitrogen (\u03c3HOMO) on one unit and the acceptor orbital of the C\u2212X (\u03c3*LUMO) on the adjacent unit. As such, the HOMO-LUMO gap in the \u03c3-system decreases, and the cooperativity increases with chain length revealing the similarity in the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen and halogen bonds."

Using state-of-the-art quantum chemical computations, this work uncovers that these bonds do not contract due to the increasing percentage of s-character of the hybrid orbital at the pertinent carbon, as is commonly accepted, but, instead, because the steric congestion around this carbon atom decreases as the coordination number goes from 4 to 3 to 2 for sp3 to sp2 to sp, respectively.

Our quantum chemical bonding analyses based on Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory show that the generally accepted rationale behind this trend is incorrect. Inspection of the molecular orbitals and their corresponding orbital overlaps reveals that the above-mentioned shortening in C\u2212H and C\u2212C bonds is not determined by an increasing amount of s-character at the carbon atom in these bonds. Instead, we establish that this structural trend is caused by a diminishing steric (Pauli) repulsion between substituents around the pertinent carbon atom, as the coordination number decreases along sp3 to sp2 to sp."

Plastic remains a key material in the global economy, but low rates of collection, reuse and recycling, emissions of microplastic from product wear and tear, and often insufficient disposal measures are leading to far-reaching environmental, health, social and economic impacts. The costs of inaction are unacceptably high. Globally there is a growing recognition of the need to address marine litter and rethink our approach to plastics and plastic packaging within the economy. Measures that enable a transition to a circular economy can avoid waste and reduce marine litter, and contribute to keeping plastics and their value in the economy."

The design and monitoring of bioremediation techniques for hydrocarbons rely on a thorough understanding of the diversityof enzymes involved in the processes of hydrocarbon degradation and the microbes that harbor their allocated genes. This review describes the impact of hydrocarbon pollution on soil microbial communities, the state of the art of detecting functional genes, and functional groups. We will focus on i) the structure, function and succession behavior of microbial communities exposed to hydrocarbons, ii) key genes and pathways, iii) future prospect into bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in aerobic environments. The aim is to get a fundamental insight in these issues to ultimately improve petroleum hydrocarbons bioremediation.Keywords: Petroleum hydrocarbons, microbial communities, functional genes, oil degradation, bioremediation"

  "description": "Detection and prioritization of unknown compounds in water extracts from drinking water production.The goal of this study is to enhance the identification of unknown compounds inLC chromatograms of untreated raw water used for drinking water production by(1) preconcentration of samples and (2) prioritization of the unknown peaks basedon their bioactivity. Preconcentration was done by solid phase extraction (SPE) of3L large volume (LV) groundwater samples or by 6-week passive sampler (PS)deployment in the groundwater, using divinylbenzene as active phase. Bioactivityof the samples was tested as a decrease in bioluminescence in the Allivibriofischeri bioassay, which was chosen as a broad-scale bioanalytical tool respondingto many different types of pollutants. Samples were collected at three differentdrinking water production stations with low or high degree of anthropogenicinfluence. At two stations, different groundwater inlets were sampled. At onestation, samples were taken at different stages in the drinking water productionprocess. SPE and PS extracts were used for target analysis and non-targetscreening, and for testing in the bioassay before and after high-resolutionfractionation. More target compounds were detected in the concentrated LV andPS extracts than in a 1 mL direct injection of the water. As expected leastcompounds and lowest bioassay responses were detected in the raw water fromthe station with least anthropogenic influence. PS extracts gave much higherbioassay responses than the LV extracts. Both chemical and bioassay analysis ofsamples collected during subsequent steps in the drinking water productionprocess confirmed the efficient removal of (bioactive) contaminants. In addition tothe 4 peaks detected in the bioassay chromatogram of the reference station, themore anthropogenically influenced stations showed additional peaks indicative forthe presence of anthropogenic substances. Identification of suspect compoundsresponsible for these additional peaks will proceed according to a three-stepprocedure, i.e. based on (1) exact mass and isotopic pattern of compoundsavailable in different suspect lists, (2) fragment ions assigned to a precursoravailable in spectral libraries, and (3) estimated elemental composition. Referencestandards will be obtained for the suspect compounds to confirm their retentiontime and bioactivity. Results from the identification process are available by theend of May 2020, and will be presented at the SETAC Europe conference."

  "description": "Structure and dynamics of a mycobacterial typeVII secretion systemMycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of one of the most important infectious diseases in humans, which leads to 1.4 million deaths every year1. Specialized protein transport systems-known as type VII secretion systems (T7SSs)-are central to the virulence of this pathogen, and are also crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport across the mycobacterial cell envelope2,3. Here we present the structure of an intact T7SS inner-membrane complex of M. tuberculosis. We show how the 2.32-MDa ESX-5 assembly, which contains 165 transmembrane helices, is restructured and stabilized as a trimer of dimers by the MycP5 protease. A trimer of MycP5 caps a central periplasmic dome-like chamber that is formed by three EccB5 dimers, with the proteolytic sites of MycP5 facing towards the cavity. This chamber suggests a central secretion and processing conduit. Complexes without MycP5 show disruption of the EccB5 periplasmic assembly and increased flexibility, which highlights the importance of MycP5 for complex integrity. Beneath the EccB5-MycP5 chamber, dimers of the EccC5 ATPase assemble into three bundles of four transmembrane helices each, which together seal the potential central secretion channel. Individual cytoplasmic EccC5 domains adopt two distinctive conformations that probably reflect different secretion states. Our work suggests a previously undescribed mechanism of protein transport and provides a structural scaffold to aid in the development of drugs against this major human pathogen."

The extremum point search is one of the two key steps for finding the minimax approximation. If pre-tabulation of initial guesses is supposed to be avoided, strategies for a sufficiently robust algorithm have not been discussed so far.

  "description": "Resilience of soil microbial communities to metals and additional stressors: DNA-Based approaches for assessing \"stress-on-stress\" responsesMany microbial ecology studies have demonstrated profound changes in community composition caused by environmental pollution, as well as adaptation processes allowing survival of microbes in polluted ecosystems. Soil microbial communities in polluted areas with a long-term history of contamination have been shown to maintain their function by developing metal-tolerance mechanisms. In the present work, we review recent experiments, with specific emphasis on studies that have been conducted in polluted areas with a long-term history of contamination that also applied DNA-based approaches. We evaluate how the \u201ccosts\u201d of adaptation to metals affect the responses of metal-tolerant communities to other stress factors (\u201cstress-on-stress\u201d). We discuss recent studies on the stability of microbial communities, in terms of resistance and resilience to additional stressors, focusing on metal pollution as the initial stress, and discuss possible factors influencing the functional and structural stability of microbial communities towards secondary stressors. There is increasing evidence that the history of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes play central roles in responses of microbial communities towards secondary stressors."

  "description": "Nucleophilic substitution at di- and triphosphates: leaving group ability of phosphate versus diphosphateAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the universal energy carrier in biochemical processes. Herein, we aim for a better understanding of the origin of the high-energy content of the triphosphate moiety involved, the influence of various physicochemical factors thereon, and implication for the actual SN2@P-induced hydrolysis, which drives uphill biochemical processes, such as, DNA replication. To this end, we have investigated the SN2@P-induced hydrolysis of triphosphate (PPP) versus that of diphosphate (PP) using density functional theory (DFT) at COSMO(H2O)-ZORA-OLYP/TZ2P. We find that SN2@P-induced hydrolysis of PPP is favored over that of PP, both kinetically and thermodynamically. The energetic advantage of PPP over PP is slightly diminished by the coordination of Mg2+ counterions. Our activation strain and energy decomposition analyses reveal that the activation barrier for PPP hydrolysis is lower compared to that for PP due to a weaker P\u03b1\u2013O leaving group bond."

  "title": "A deep dive into fat: Investigating blubber lipidomic fingerprint of killer whales and humpback whales in northern Norway\u00a9 2021 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.In cetaceans, blubber is the primary and largest lipid body reservoir. Our current understanding about lipid stores and uses in cetaceans is still limited, and most studies only focused on a single narrow snapshot of the lipidome. We documented an extended lipidomic fingerprint in two cetacean species present in northern Norway during wintertime. We were able to detect 817 molecular lipid species in blubber of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The profiles were largely dominated by triradylglycerols in both species and, to a lesser extent, by other constituents including glycerophosphocholines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and diradylglycerols. Through a unique combination of traditional statistical approaches, together with a novel bioinformatic tool (LION/web), we showed contrasting fingerprint composition between species. The higher content of triradylglycerols in humpback whales is necessary to fuel their upcoming half a year fasting and energy-demanding migration between feeding and breeding grounds. In adipocytes, we assume that the intense feeding rate of humpback whales prior to migration translates into an important accumulation of triacylglycerol content in lipid droplets. Upstream, the endoplasmic reticulum is operating at full capacity to supply acute lipid storage, consistent with the reported enrichment of glycerophosphocholines in humpback whales, major components of the endoplasmic reticulum. There was also an enrichment of membrane components, which translates into higher sphingolipid content in the lipidome of killer whales, potentially as a structural adaptation for their higher hydrodynamic performance. Finally, the presence of both lipid-enriched and lipid-depleted individuals within the killer whale population in Norway suggests dietary specialization, consistent with significant differences in \u03b415N and \u03b413C isotopic ratios in skin between the two groups, with higher values and a wider niche for the lipid-enriched individuals. Results suggest the lipid-depleted killer whales were herring specialists, while the lipid-enriched individuals might feed on both herrings and seals.General information",

  "title": "D-dopachrome tautomerase contributes to lung epithelial repair via atypical chemokine receptor 3-dependent Akt signaling\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)Background: Emphysematous COPD is characterized by aberrant alveolar repair. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) contributes to alveolar repair, but for its structural and functional homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) this is unknown. MIF mediates its effects through CD74 and/or C-X-C chemokine receptors 2 (CXCR2), 4(CXCR4), and possibly 7 (ACKR3). DDT can also signal through CD74, but interactions with other receptors have not been described yet. We therefore aimed at investigating if and how DDT contributes to epithelial repair in COPD. Methods: We studied effects of recombinant DDT on cell proliferation and survival by clonogenic assay and annexin V-PI staining respectively. DDT-induced signaling was investigated by Western blot. Effects on epithelial growth and differentiation was studied using lung organoid cultures with primary murine or human epithelial cells and incubating with DDT or an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. DDT-ACKR3 interactions were identified by ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation. Findings: We found that DDT promoted proliferation of and prevented staurosporine-induced apoptosis in A549 lung epithelial cells. Importantly, DDT also stimulated growth of primary alveolar epithelial cells as DDT treatment resulted in significantly more and larger murine and human alveolar organoids compared to untreated controls. The anti-apoptotic effect of DDT and DDT-induced organoid growth were inhibited in the presence of an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. Furthermore, ELISA assay and co-immunoprecipitation suggested DDT complexes with ACKR3. DDT could activate the PI3K-Akt pathway and this activation was enhanced in ACKR3-overexpressing cells. Interpretation: In conclusion, DDT contributes to alveolar epithelial repair via ACKR3 and may thus augment lung epithelial repair in COPD.General information",

Solutions of polyester samples were infused directly into the ion source employing electrospray ionization (ESI). TIMS-MS provides both mobility and m/z data on the formed ions, allowing construction of extracted-ion mobilograms (EIMs). EIMs of polyester molecules showed multimodal patterns, indicating conformational differences among isomers.

Observing larger oligomers (up to 3000 Da) using TIMS required additional molecular charging to ensure ion entrapment within the mobility window. Molecular supercharging was achieved using m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA). The additional charges on the oligomer structures enhanced mobility separation of isomeric species but also added to the complexity of the obtained fragmentation mass spectra. This complexity could be partly reduced by post-TIMS analyte-decharging applying collision-induced dissociation (CID) prior to Q1 with subsequent isolation of the singly charged ions for further fragmentation.

  "description": "Age-Dependent Hippocampal Proteomics in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer Mouse Model: A Comparative Analysis with Classical SWATH/DIA and directDIA ApproachesAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the human population, for which there is currently no cure. The cause of AD is unknown; however, the toxic effects of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) are believed to play a role in its onset. To investigate this, we examined changes in global protein levels in a hippocampal synaptosome fraction of the Amyloid Precursor Protein swe/Presenelin 1 dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD at 6 and 12 months of age (moa). Data independent acquisition (DIA), or Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical fragment-ion (SWATH), was used for a quantitative label-free proteomics analysis. We first assessed the usefulness of a recently improved directDIA workflow as an alternative to conventional DIA data analysis using a project-specific spectral library. Subsequently, we applied directDIA to the 6- and 12-moa APP/PS1 datasets and applied the Mass Spectrometry Downstream Analysis Pipeline (MS-DAP) for differential expression analysis and candidate discovery. We observed most regulation at 12-moa, in particular of proteins involved in A\u03b2 homeostasis and microglial-dependent processes, like synaptic pruning and the immune response, such as APOE, CLU and C1QA-C. All proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025777."

This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium provided that the original work is properly attributed.Protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) is critical for synaptic plasticity and learning, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here we identified different types of proteins that interact with PP2B, including various structural proteins of the postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of Purkinje cells (PCs) in mice. Deleting PP2B reduced expression of PSD proteins and the relative thickness of PSD at the parallel fiber to PC synapses, whereas reexpression of inactive PP2B partly restored the impaired distribution of nanoclusters of PSD proteins, together indicating a structural role of PP2B. In contrast, lateral mobility of surface glutamate receptors solely depended on PP2B phosphatase activity. Finally, the level of motor learning covaried with both the enzymatic and nonenzymatic functions of PP2B. Thus, PP2B controls synaptic function and learning both through its action as a phosphatase and as a structural protein that facilitates synapse integrity.General information",

Here we identified different types of proteins that interact with PP2B, including various structural proteins of the postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of Purkinje cells (PCs) in mice. Deleting PP2B reduced expression of PSD proteins and the relative thickness of PSD at the parallel fiber to PC synapses, whereas reexpression of inactive PP2B partly restored the impaired distribution of nanoclusters of PSD proteins, together indicating a structural role of PP2B.

  "description": "An in vitro strategy using multiple human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived models to assess the toxicity of chemicals: A case study on paraquatMost OECD guidelines for chemical risk assessment include tests performed on animals, raising financial, ethical and scientific concerns. Thus, the development of human-based models for toxicity testing is highly encouraged. Here, we propose an in vitro multi-organ strategy to assess the toxicity of chemicals. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived models of the brain, blood-brain barrier, kidney, liver and vasculature were generated and exposed to paraquat (PQ), a widely employed herbicide with known toxic effects in kidneys and brain. The models showed differential cytotoxic sensitivity to PQ after acute exposure. TempO-Seq\u2122 analysis with a set of 3565 probes revealed the deregulation of oxidative stress, unfolded protein response and Estrogen Receptor-mediated signaling pathways, in line with the existing knowledge on PQ mechanisms of action. The main advantages of this strategy are to assess chemical toxicity on multiple tissues/organs in parallel, exclusively in human cells, eliminating the interspecies bias, allowing a better evaluation of the differential sensitivity of the models representing the diverse organs, and increasing the chance to identify toxic compounds. Furthermore, although we focused on the mechanisms of action of PQ shared by the different models, this strategy would also allow for organ-specific toxicity testing, by including more cell type-specific probes for TempO-Seq analyses. In conclusion, we believe this strategy will participate in the further improvement of chemical risk assessment for human health."

  "description": "Exploring the Activity Profile of TbrPDEB1 and hPDE4 Inhibitors Using Free Energy PerturbationHuman African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (T.b.). A validated target for the treatment of HAT is the parasitic T.b. cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase B1 (TbrPDEB1). Although nanomolar TbrPDEB1 inhibitors have been obtained, their activity against the off-target human PDE4 (hPDE4) is likely to lead to undesirable clinical side effects, such as nausea, emesis, and immune suppression. Thus, new and more selective TbrPDEB1 inhibitors are still needed. This retrospective study evaluated the free energy perturbation (FEP+) method to predict the affinity profiles of TbrPDEB1 inhibitors against hPDE4. We demonstrate that FEP+ can be used to accurately predict the activity profiles of these homologous proteins. Moreover, we show how FEP+ can overcome challenges like protein flexibility and high sequence conservation. This also implies that the method can be applied prospectively for the lead optimization campaigns to design new and more selective TbrPDEB1 inhibitors."

  "description": "Modified Guanines as Constituents of Smart Ligands for Nucleic Acid QuadruplexesRepetitive guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences play a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and the cell life cycle and represent potential targets for regulatory drugs. Recently, it has been demonstrated that guanine-based ligands with a porphyrin core can be used as markers of G-quadruplex assemblies in cell tissues. Herein, model systems of guanine-based ligands are explored by DFT methods. The energies of formation of modified guanine tetrads and those of modified tetrads stacked on the top of natural guanine tetrads have been calculated. The interaction energy has been decomposed into contributions from hydrogen bonding, stacking, and ion coordination and a twist\u2013rise potential energy scan has been performed to find the individual local minima. Energy decomposition analysis reveals the impact of various substituents (F, Cl, Br, I, Me, NMe2) on individual energy terms. In addition, cooperative reinforcement in forming the modified and stacked tetrads, as well as the frontier orbitals participating in the hydrogen-bonding framework involving the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap between the occupied \u03c3HOMO on the proton-accepting C=O and =N\u2212 groups and unoccupied \u03c3LUMO on the N\u2212H groups, has been studied. The investigated systems are demonstrated to have a potential in ligand development, mainly due to stacking enhancement compared with natural guanine, which is used as a reference."

  "description": "How sticky are our proteins? Quantifying hydrophobicity of the human proteomeProteins tend to bury hydrophobic residues inside their core during the folding process to provide stability to the protein structure and to prevent aggregation. Nevertheless, proteins do expose some 'sticky' hydrophobic residues to the solvent. These residues can play an important functional role, for example in protein-protein and membrane interactions. Here, we investigate how hydrophobic protein surfaces are by providing three measures for surface hydrophobicity: the total hydrophobic surface area, the relative hydrophobic surface area, and - using our MolPatch method - the largest hydrophobic patch. Secondly, we analyse how difficult it is to predict these measures from sequence: by adapting solvent accessibility predictions from NetSurfP2.0, we obtain well-performing prediction methods for the THSA and RHSA, while predicting LHP is more difficult. Finally, we analyse implications of exposed hydrophobic surfaces: we show that hydrophobic proteins typically have low expression, suggesting cells avoid an overabundance of sticky proteins. "

  "description": "Predicting Pt-195 NMR chemical shift using new relativistic all-electron basis setPredicting NMR properties is a valuable tool to assist the experimentalists in the characterization of molecular structure. For heavy metals, such as Pt-195, only a few computational protocols are available. In the present contribution, all-electron Gaussian basis sets, suitable to calculate the Pt-195 NMR chemical shift, are presented for Pt and all elements commonly found as Pt-ligands. The new basis sets identified as NMR-DKH were partially contracted as a triple-zeta doubly polarized scheme with all coefficients obtained from a Douglas\u2013Kroll\u2013Hess (DKH) second-order scalar relativistic calculation. The Pt-195 chemical shift was predicted through empirical models fitted to reproduce experimental data for a set of 183 Pt(II) complexes which NMR sign ranges from \u22121000 to \u22126000 ppm. Furthermore, the models were validated using a new set of 75 Pt(II) complexes, not included in the descriptive set. The models were constructed using non-relativistic Hamiltonian at density functional theory (DFT-PBEPBE) level with NMR-DKH basis set for all atoms. For the best model, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the mean relative deviation (MRD) were 150 ppm and 6%, respectively, for the validation set (75 Pt-complexes) and 168 ppm (MAD) and 5% (MRD) for all 258 Pt(II) complexes. These results were comparable with relativistic DFT calculation, 200 ppm (MAD) and 6% (MRD). "

The aim of this study was to explore differences in proteomic profiles, for 117 pro-inflammatory proteins, in two previously defined groups of individuals with different DNA damage and EPA and DHA levels. Healthy children and adolescents (n = 140) aged 9 to 13 years old in an urban area of Brazil were divided by k-means cluster test into two clusters of DNA damage (tail intensity) using the comet assay (cluster 1 = 5.9% \u00b1 1.2 and cluster 2 = 13.8% \u00b1 3.1) in our previous study. The cluster with higher DNA damage and lower levels of DHA (6.2 \u00b1 1.6 mg/dL; 5.4 \u00b1 1.3 mg/dL, p = 0.003) and EPA (0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mg/dL; 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 mg/dL, p < 0.001) presented increased expression of the proteins CDK8\u2013CCNC, PIK3CA\u2013PIK3R1, KYNU, and PRKCB, which are involved in pro-inflammatory pathways. Our findings support the hypothesis that low levels of n-3 long-chain PUFA may have a less protective role against DNA damage through expression of pro-inflammatory proteins, such as CDK8\u2013CCNC, PIK3CA\u2013PIK3R1, KYNU, and PRKCB."

  "description": "Combining cell envelope stress reporter assays in a screening approach to identify BAM complex inhibitorsThe development of new antibiotics is particularly problematic in Gram-negative bacteria due to the presence of the outer membrane (OM), which serves as a permeability barrier. Recently, the \u03b2-barrel assembly machine (BAM), located in the OM and responsible for \u03b2-barrel type OM protein (OMP) assembly, has been validated as a novel target for antibiotics. Here, we identified potential BAM complex inhibitors using a screening approach that reports on cell envelope \u03c3E and Rcs stress in Escherichia coli. Screening a library consisting of 316\u202f953 compounds yielded five compounds that induced \u03c3E and Rcs stress responses, while not inducing the intracellular heat-shock response. Two of the five compounds (compounds 2 and 14) showed the characteristics of known BAM complex inhibitors: synergy with OMP biogenesis mutants, decrease in the abundance of various OMPs, and loss of OM integrity. Importantly, compound 2 also inhibited BAM-dependent OMP folding in an in vitro refolding assay using purified BAM complex reconstituted in proteoliposomes."

  "description": "libRCGA: a C library for real-coded genetic algorithms for rapid parameter estimation of kinetic modelsKinetic modeling is a powerful tool to understand how a biochemical system behaves as a whole. To develop a realistic and predictive model, kinetic parameters need to be estimated so that a model fits experimental data. However, parameter estimation remains a major bottleneck in kinetic modeling. To accelerate parameter estimation, we developed a C library for real-coded genetic algorithms (libRCGA). In libRCGA, two real-coded genetic algorithms (RCGAs), viz. the Unimodal Normal Distribution Crossover with Minimal Generation Gap (UNDX/MGG) and the Real-coded Ensemble Crossover star with Just Generation Gap (REX star/JGG), are implemented in C language and paralleled by Message Passing Interface (MPI). We designed libRCGA to take advantage of high-performance computing environments and thus to significantly accelerate parameter estimation. Constrained optimization formulation is useful to construct a realistic kinetic model that satisfies several biological constraints. libRCGA employs stochastic ranking to efficiently solve constrained optimization problems. In the present paper, we demonstrate the performance of libRCGA through benchmark problems and in realistic parameter estimation problems. libRCGA is freely available for academic usage at http://kurata21.bio.kyutech.ac.jp/maeda/index.html."

  "description": "Clinical Metabolomics: Expanding the Metabolome Coverage Using Advanced Analytical TechniquesMetabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of all metabolites and intermediate products of reactions present within a biological system, is a promising field to enable precision medicine. Clinical metabolomics faces two main challenges at the bioanalytical level. The first is the need for high resolution to obtain maximum metabolome coverage. This is exemplified by the latest version of the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB), which reports more than 110,000 metabolites and endogenous compounds. The second is the high-throughput needed to enable the analysis of a large number of samples typically encountered in large-scale cohort studies. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) at regular or ultrahigh pressures combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) has long been considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d in metabolomics. However, these conventional reversed-phase LC\u2013MS approaches are no longer sufficient to analyze the vast variety of polar compounds, as well as discriminate closely related compounds such as isomers or enantiomers. This review article discusses the novel separation and detection strategies that are considered promising in clinical metabolomics to enhance the metabolome coverage. It includes hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), multidimensional LC approaches, as well as ion-mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis methods."

  "description": "Not (Only) reversed-phase lc\u2013ms: Alternative lc\u2013ms approachesElectrospray ionization (ESI) and other ambient ionization techniques have allowed a successful interface between liquid chromatography (LC) and mass spectrometry (MS). The coupling of these two high-resolution techniques has fostered the use of analytical science in various fields, including, but not limited to, the clinical, pharmaceutical, and forensic fields, enabling the analysis, identification, and characterization of thousands of molecular components in a large diversity of complex mixtures. For many years, reversed-phase LC has remained the most commonly adopted chromatographic mode, due to its rather straightforward applicability to the analysis of a wide variety of compounds (from small to large molecules), as well as its direct compatibility with ESI-MS. However, reversed-phase LC\u2013MS has shown relevant limitations in a number of analytical applications. This encouraged the development of alternative MS-compatible chromatographic techniques, including hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC), supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), ion-exchange chromatography (IEC), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), which provide analyte separation in the liquid phase based on different retention mechanisms compared with reversed-phase LC. Here, we present these alternative chromatographic approaches, highlighting the recent relevant applications in various fields, and discussing their potential in future of analytical science investigations."

  "description": "A quantitative Kohn\u2013Sham approach to elementary redox reactions in artificial, bio-inspired and biological catalysisAlthough seemingly distant, there is a strong synergy between redox reactions and catalyzed processes and, not infrequently, one is often accompanied by the other. Density functional theory has been extensively used to study selected cases ranging from small-scale inorganic catalysis to enzymatic processes as well as bioinspired molecular systems. In the first part, [2+2+2] cycloaddition reactions have been used as a study case to draw the essential elements for a rational design of group 9 metal half-sandwich catalysts. Secondly, the problem of the oxidative stress has been introduced as well as few small organic molecules acting as antioxidants: a deep study on the radical scavenging activity of these bioinspired mimics has been performed and the presence of different chalcogens (S, Se, Te) has been carefully analyzed in order to detect any potential glutathione peroxidase\u2010like activity. Lastly, the role of the aforementioned chalcogen nuclei has been investigated in four selected enzymes which share a common peroxidatic (seleno)cysteine in the active site and play a crucial role in balancing the harmful condition of oxidative stress. In all the reported examples, it emerges that elementary redox reactions play a role of paramount importance."

  "description": "Association of lysophosphatidic acids with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and progression to Alzheimer's diseaseBACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) are bioactive signaling phospholipids that have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is largely unknown whether LPAs are associated with AD pathology and progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.METHODS: The current study was performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples of 182 MCI patients from two independent cohorts. We profiled LPA-derived metabolites using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We evaluated the association of LPAs with CSF biomarkers of AD, A\u03b2-42, p-tau, and total tau levels overall and stratified by APOE genotype and with MCI to AD progression.RESULTS: Five LPAs (C16:0, C16:1, C22:4, C22:6, and isomer-LPA C22:5) showed significant positive association with CSF biomarkers of AD, A\u03b2-42, p-tau, and total tau, while LPA C14:0 and C20:1 associated only with A\u03b2-42 and alkyl-LPA C18:1, and LPA C20:1 associated with tau pathology biomarkers. Association of cyclic-LPA C16:0 and two LPAs (C20:4, C22:4) with A\u03b2-42 levels was found only in APOE \u03b54 carriers. Furthermore, LPA C16:0 and C16:1 also showed association with MCI to AD dementia progression, but results did not replicate in an independent cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that LPAs may contribute to early AD pathogenesis. Future studies are needed to determine whether LPAs play a role in upstream of AD pathology or are downstream markers of neurodegeneration."

  "description": "Analysis of Lipid Metabolism, Immune Function, and Neurobehavior in Adult C57BL/6JxFVB Mice After Developmental Exposure to di (2-ethylhexyl) PhthalateBackground: Developmental exposure to di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been implicated in the onset of metabolic syndrome later in life. Alterations in neurobehavior and immune functions are also affected by phthalate exposure and may be linked to the metabolic changes caused by developmental exposure to DEHP. Objectives: Our goal was to study the effects of developmental exposure to DEHP in the context of metabolic syndrome by integrating different parameters to assess metabolic, neurobehavioral, and immune functions in one model. Methods: Female C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEHP through the diet during gestation and lactation at doses ranging from 3.3 to 100,000 \u03bcg/kg body weight/day (\u03bckd). During a 1-year follow-up period, a wide set of metabolic parameters was assessed in the F1 offspring, including weekly body weight measurements, food consumption, physical activity, glucose homeostasis, serum lipids, and endocrine profile. In addition, neurobehavioral and immune functions were assessed by sweet preference test, object recognition test, acute phase protein, and cytokines production. Animals were challenged with a high fat diet (HFD) in the last 9 weeks of the study. Results: Increased free fatty acids (FFA) and, high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) were observed in serum, together with a decrease in glycated hemoglobin levels in blood of 1-year old male DEHP-exposed offspring after HFD challenge. For the most sensitive endpoint measured (FFA), a lower bound of the 90%-confidence interval for benchmark dose (BMD) at a critical effect size of 5% (BMDL) of 2,160 \u03bckd was calculated. No persistent changes in body weight or fat mass were observed. At 33,000 \u03bckd altered performance was found in the object recognition test in males and changes in interferon (IFN)\u03b3 production were observed in females. Conclusions: Developmental exposure to DEHP combined with HFD in adulthood led to changes in lipid metabolism and neurobehavior in male offspring and cytokine production in female offspring. Our findings contribute to the evidence that DEHP is a developmental dyslipidemic chemical, however, more research is needed to further characterize adverse health outcomes and the mechanisms of action associated with the observed sex-specific effects."

  "description": "Conformation and Bonding: Theoretical Studies on Conformational Effects and Lewis Pair StabilityThis thesis consists of a collection of density functional theory investigations on conformational effects and bonding mechanism in halogenated model systems. First, thorough analyses of the physical forces underlying the gauche effect and the rotational barriers of 1,2-disubstituted ethanes have been performed. Then, the trends in bond strength of archetypal donor\u2013acceptor Lewis pairs have been systematically evaluated. The main purpose is to obtain physically meaningful rationales to explain the studied chemical phenomena. The detailed analyses presented herein shed light on often overlooked quantum chemical effects behind the observed conformational preferences and bonding strengths. It is expected that the fundamental insights provided in this thesis will be a step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of halogen atoms on the structure and bonding of organic and inorganic compounds, which could be extended to rationalize, predict, and tune the properties of more complex molecular systems."

  "description": "Theoretical study of actinide monocarbides (ThC, UC, PuC, and AmC)A study of four representative actinide monocarbides, ThC, UC, PuC, and AmC, has been performed with relativistic quantum chemical calculations. The two applied methods were multireference com- plete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) including the Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian with all-electron basis sets and density functional theory with the B3LYP exchange- correlation functional in conjunction with relativistic pseudopotentials. Beside the ground electronic states, the excited states up to 17 000 cm 1 have been determined. The molecular properties explored included the ground-state geometries, bonding properties, and the electronic absorption spectra. According to the occupation of the bonding orbitals, the calculated electronic states were classified into three groups, each leading to a characteristic bond distance range for the equilibrium geometry. The ground states of ThC, UC, and PuC have two doubly occupied \u03c0 orbitals resulting in short bond distances between 1.8 and 2.0 \u00c5, whereas the ground state of AmC has significant occupation of the antibonding orbitals, causing a bond distance of 2.15 \u00c5."

  "description": "Strategies for protein structure model generationThis chapter deals with approaches for protein three-dimensional structure prediction, starting out from a single input sequence with unknown struc- ture, the 'query' or 'target' sequence. Both template based and template free modelling techniques are treated, and how resulting structural models may be selected and refined. We give a concrete flowchart for how to de- cide which modelling strategy is best suited in particular circumstances, and which steps need to be taken in each strategy. Notably, the ability to locate a suitable structural template by homology or fold recognition is crucial; without this models will be of low quality at best. With a template avail- able, the quality of the query-template alignment crucially determines the model quality. We also discuss how other, courser, experimental data may be incorporated in the modelling process to alleviate the problem of missing template structures. Finally, we discuss measures to predict the quality of models generated."

  "description": "MMP activation associated Aminopeptidase N reveals a bivalent 14-3-3 binding motifAminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) is a trans-membrane ectopeptidase involved in many crucial cellular functions. Besides its role as a peptidase, APN also mediates signal transduction, and is involved in the activation of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs function in tissue remodeling within the extracellular space and are therefore involved in many human diseases such as fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, tumor angiogenesis and metastasis as well as viral infections. However, the exact mechanism that leads to APN driven MMP activation is unclear. It was previously shown that extracellular 14-3-3 adapter proteins binding APN induces the transcription of MMPs. As a first step, we sought to identify potential 14\u20113\u20113 binding sites in the APN sequence. We constructed a set of phosphorylated peptides derived from APN to probe for interactions. We identified and characterized a canonical 14-3-3 binding site (site 1) within the flexible, structurally unresolved N-terminal APN region using direct binding Fluorescence Polarization (FP) assays and thermodynamic analysis (ITC). In addition, we identified a secondary, non-canonical binding site (site 2), which enhances the binding affinity in combination with site 1 by many orders of magnitude. Finally, we solved crystal structures of 14\u20113\u20113\u03c3 bound to mono- and bis\u2011phosphorylated APN derived peptides, which revealed atomic details of the binding mode of mono- and bivalent 14-3-3 interactions. Therefore, our findings shed some light on the first steps of APN-mediated MMP activation and opens the field for further investigation of this important signaling pathway."

  "description": "Cycloaddition Reactions: Design Principles from Quantum Chemical AnalysesCycloaddition reactions provide facile access to cyclic compounds with a high atom economy. As such, these reactions have found applications in almost all fields of chemistry, including organic synthesis, material science, medicinal chemistry, and biological chemistry. In particular, the most studied and useful concerted cycloadditions (pericyclic reactions) are the Diels-Alder reaction and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. A systematic understanding of the reactivity, regio- and stereo-selectivity of pericyclic reactions is a prerequisite for the rational design of these reactions. This thesis is dedicated to a study of four critical factors that are used to tune the reactivity of pericyclic reactions: the heteroatom, geometry of the reactant, catalyst, and external electric field. These factors are studied by performing computational studies on four representative Diels-Alder reactions or 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions using DFT calculations and quantum chemical analyses, including the activation strain model (ASM), energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) theory. Our findings based on these analyses furnish fundamental insights into how these internal and external factors alter the reactivity of cycloaddition reactions."
