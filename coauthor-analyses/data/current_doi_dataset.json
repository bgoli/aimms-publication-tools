  "description": "Clock-Talk: Interactions between central and peripheral circadian oscillators in mammalsIn mammals, including humans, nearly all physiological processes are subject to daily oscillations that are governed by acircadian timing system with a complex hierarchical structure. The central pacemaker, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) of the ventral hypothalamus, is synchronized daily by photic cues transmitted from the retina to SCN neurons via theretinohypothalamic tract. In turn, the SCN must establish phase coherence between self-sustained and cell-autonomousoscillators present in most peripheral cell types. The synchronization signals (Zeitgebers) can be controlled more or lessdirectly by the SCN. In mice and rats, feeding-fasting rhythms, which are driven by the SCN through rest-activity cycles, are the most potent Zeitgebers for the circadian oscillators of peripheral organs. Signaling through the glucocorticoid receptorand the serum response factor also participate in the phase entrainment of peripheral clocks, and these two pathwaysare controlled by the SCN independently of feeding-fasting rhythms. Body temperature rhythms, governed by the SCNdirectly and indirectly through rest-activity cycles, are perhaps the most surprising cues for peripheral oscillators. Althoughthe molecular makeup of circadian oscillators is nearly identical in all cells, these oscillators are used for different purposes inthe SCN and in peripheral organs."

In this study, we describe the synthesis, radiolabelling and in vitro evaluation of [3H]-1 for the characterisation of GPR139 and its spatial expression in the brain using autoradiography. Two different synthesis routes for the radiolabelling of 1 based on a reductive debromination strategy were investigated using deuterium (D2, g). The route based on reductive debromination of the bromonaphthyl precursor 5 proved superior over arylbromide 4 and was employed for the radiolabelling experiments. Reductive debromination of precursor 5 was accomplished using 3H2, Pd/C and triethylamine in DMF at ambient temperature to give target molecule [3H]-1 with a specific activity of 19.3 Ci mmol-1 and a radiochemical purity of \u226595%. By application of autoradiography and binding studies, it was not possible to discriminate [3H]-1 binding to wildtype mice brains from GPR139 knockout mice brains and total binding from non-specific binding in CHO-k1 cells stably expressing human GPR139 receptor. Based on these experiments we conclude that [3H]-1 is not a suitable radioligand for the characterisation of GPR139."

  "description": "Charge-transfer (CT) orbitals for the one-electron description of CT excitations in a wide range of donor-acceptor separationsA transformation of the virtual Kohn-Sham orbitals is proposed to a set of charge-transfer orbitals (CTOs) adapted to description of CT excitations. The CTO scheme offers a simple estimate of the CT excitation energy with an orbital energy difference. This estimate reproduces well the reference values of the configuration interaction (CI) method in a wide range of donor-acceptor separations in the paradigmatic He-Be complex. CTO-based orbital energy and shape indices are proposed to assess the suitability of the CT description with virtual orbitals of a given basis set. Both indices yield correct trends for the Kohn-Sham and Hartree-Fock orbitals."

  "description": "Discovery of 4-amino-3-arylsulfoquinolines, a novel non-acetylenic chemotype of metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) receptor negative allosteric modulatorsNegative allosteric modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) showed efficacy in a number of animal models of different CNS diseases including anxiety and depression. Virtually all of the compounds which reached the clinic belong to the same chemotype having an acetylenic linker that connects (hetero)cyclic moieties. Searching for new chemotypes we identified a morpholino-sulfoquinoline derivative (1) by screening our corporate compound deck. The HTS hit showed reasonable affinity and selectivity towards mGlu5 receptors, however, its inferior metabolic stability prevented its testing invivo. In a chemical program we aimed to improve the affinity, physicochemical properties and metabolic stability exploring three regions of the hit. Systematic variation of different amines at position 4 (region I) led to the identification of 4-methyl-piperidinyl analogues. Substituents of the quinoline core (region II) and the phenylsulfonyl moiety (region III) were mapped by parallel synthesis. Evaluation of both morpholino- and 4-methyl-piperidinyl-sulfoquinoline libraries of about 270 derivatives revealed beneficial substituent combinations in regions II and III. Blood levels of optimized 4-methyl-piperidinyl-sulfoquinolines, however, were still insufficient for robust invivo efficacy. Finally, introducing 4-hydoxymethyl-piperidinyl substituent to region I resulted in new sulfoquinolines with greatly improved solubility and reasonable affinity coupled with affordable metabolic stability. The most promising analogues (24 and 25) showed high blood levels and demonstrated significant efficacy in the experimental model of anxiety."

  "description": "Extreme calorie restriction in yeast retentostats induces uniform non-quiescent growth arrestNon-dividing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures are highly relevant for fundamental and applied studies. However, cultivation conditions in which non-dividing cells retain substantial metabolic activity are lacking. Unlike stationary-phase (SP) batch cultures, the current experimental paradigm for non-dividing yeast cultures, cultivation under extreme calorie restriction (ECR) in retentostat enables non-dividing yeast cells to retain substantial metabolic activity and to prevent rapid cellular deterioration. Distribution of F-actin structures and single-cell copy numbers of specific transcripts revealed that cultivation under ECR yields highly homogeneous cultures, in contrast to SP cultures that differentiate into quiescent and non-quiescent subpopulations. Combined with previous physiological studies, these results indicate that yeast cells subjected to ECR survive in an extended G1 phase. This study demonstrates that yeast cells exposed to ECR differ from carbon-starved cells and offer a promising experimental model for studying non-dividing, metabolically active, and robust eukaryotic cells."

Our current study of Scandinavian parous women aimed to address these inconsistencies and gaps in the literature. Methods: This case-cohort study included 424 mother-child pairs who participated in a prospective, multi-center study of parous women in Norway (Trondheim and Bergen) and Sweden (Uppsala). We used linear and logistic regression with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to analyze the associations between two perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and five organochlorines (OCs) from early second trimester and indices of fetal growth. Results: Among Swedish women, prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153 and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) were associated with higher odds for SGA birth. We found stronger associations among Swedish male offspring. In the Norwegian cohort, we found no significant associations between EDC exposure and indices of fetal growth. Conclusions: Some populations may be more vulnerable to EDCs, possibly due to differences in exposure levels, exposure sources and/or modifiable lifestyle factors. Male offspring may be more vulnerable to endocrine disruption."

  "description": "Th17-mediated cross protection against pneumococcal carriage by vaccination with a variable antigenSerotype-specific protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important limitation of the current polysaccharide-based vaccines. To prevent serotype replacement, reduce transmission, and limit the emergence of new variants, it is essential to induce broad protection and restrict pneumococcal colonization. In this study, we used a prototype vaccine formulation consisting of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-detoxified outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium displaying the variable N terminus of PspA (\u03b11\u03b12 ) for intranasal vaccination, which induced strong Th17 immunity associated with a substantial reduction of pneumococcal colonization. Despite the variable nature of this protein, a common major histocompatibility complex class (MHC-II) epitope was identified, based on in silico prediction combined with ex vivo screening, and was essential for interleukin-17 A (IL-17A)-mediated cross-reactivity and associated with cross protection. Based on 1,352 PspA sequences derived from a pneumococcal carriage cohort, this OMV-based vaccine formulation containing a single \u03b11\u03b12 type was estimated to cover 19.1% of strains, illustrating the potential of Th17-mediated cross protection."

  "description": "Toxicity profiling of marine surface sediments: a case study using rapid screening bioassays of exhaustive total extracts, elutriates and passive sampler extractsThis study was carried out in the framework of the ICON project (Integrated Assessment of Contaminant Impacts on the North Sea) (Hylland et al., 2015) and aimed (1) to evaluate the toxicity of marine sediments using a battery of rapid toxicity bioassays, and; (2) to explore the applicability and data interpretation of in vitro toxicity profiling of sediment extracts obtained from ex situ passive sampling. Sediment samples were collected at 12 selected (estuarine, coastal, offshore) sites in the North Sea, Icelandic waters (as reference sites), south-western Baltic Sea and western Mediterranean during autumn 2008. Organic extracts using a mild non-destructive clean-up procedure were prepared from total sediment and silicone passive samplers and tested with five in vitro bioassays: DR-Luc bioassay, ER-Luc bioassay, AR-EcoScreen bioassay, transthyretin (TTR) binding assay, and Vibrio fischeri bioluminescence bioassay. In vitro toxicity profiling of total sediment and silicone passive sampler extracts showed the presence of multiple organic contaminations by arylhydrocarbon receptor agonists (e.g. polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and endocrine-active compounds, as well as non-specific toxicity caused by organic contaminants, at virtually all sampling sites. In vitro responses to total sediment extracts from coastal/estuarine sites were significantly different from those in offshore sites (p < 0.05). Several bioassays of passive sampler extracts showed highest activity in some offshore sediment samples. Impact on embryogenesis success and larval growth in undiluted sediment elutriates was shown at some sites using the in vivo sea urchin embryo test. The observed toxicity profiles could only partially be explained by the chemical target analysis, indicating the presence of unknown or unanalysed biologically-active compounds in the sediments. In vitro bioassay testing with silicone passive sampler extracts of sediments is a promising tool to assess the toxic potency of the bioavailable fraction of hydrophobic sediment contaminants, but further work will be needed before it can be routinely applied for sediment quality assessment."

  "description": "Activation Strain Analysis of SN2 Reactions at C, N, O, and F CentersFundamental principles that determine chemical reactivity and reaction mechanisms are the very foundation of chemistry and many related fields of science. Bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions (SN2) are among the most common and therefore most important reaction types. In this report, we examine the trends in the SN2 reactions with respect to increasing electronegativity of the reaction center by comparing the wellstudied backside SN2 Cl- + CH3Cl with similar Cl- substitutions on the isoelectronic series with the second period elements N, O, and F in place of C. Relativistic (ZORA) DFT calculations are used to construct the gas phase reaction potential energy surfaces (PES), and activation strain analysis, which allows decomposition of the PES into the geometrical strain and interaction energy, is employed to analyze the observed trends. We find that SN2N and SN2O have similar PES to the prototypical SN2C, with the well-defined reaction complex (RC) local minima and a central barrier, but all stationary points are, respectively, increasingly stable in energy. The SN2F, by contrast, exhibits only a single-well PES with no barrier. Using the activation strain model, we show that the trends are due to the interaction energy and originate mainly from the decreasing energy of the empty acceptor orbital (\u03c3\u2217A-Cl) on the reaction center A in the order of C, N, O, and F. The decreasing steric congestion around the central atom is also a likely contributor to this trend. Additional decomposition of the interaction energy using Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) theory provides further support for this explanation, as well as suggesting electrostatic energy as the primary reason for the distinct single-well PES profile for the FCl reaction."

  "description": "Force Field Parametrization of Colloidal CdSe Nanocrystals Using an Adaptive Rate Monte Carlo Optimization AlgorithmIn a typical colloidal CdSe nanocrystal more than 50% of the atoms are located at the surface. These atoms can give rise to electronic traps that can deteriorate the performance of optoelectronic devices made of these nanomaterials. A key challenge in this field is thus to understand with atomistic detail the chemical processes occurring at the nanocrystal surface. Molecular dynamics simulations represent an important tool to unveil these processes, but its implementation is strongly limited by the difficulties of finely tuning classical force fields parameters, primarily caused by the unavailability of experimental data of these materials that are suitable in the parametrization procedures. In this work, we present a general scheme to produce force field parameters from first-principles calculations. This approach is based on a newly developed stochastic optimization algorithm called Adaptive Rate Monte Carlo, which is designed to be robust, accurate, easy-to-use, and flexible enough to be straightforwardly extended to other nanomaterials. We demonstrate that our algorithm provides a set of parameters capable of satisfactorily describing nonstoichiometric CdSe nanocrystals passivated with oleate ligands akin to experimental conditions. We also demonstrate that our new parameters are robust enough to be transferable among crystal structures and nanocrystals of increasing sizes up to the bulk."

In this DFT study on the formation and bonding of Group\u20059\u201312 d10 [M(NHC)n] (n=1\u20134) complexes, we found that all metals form very stable [M(NHC)2] complexes, but further coordination depends on the specific interplay of 1)\u2005the interaction energy (\u0394Eint) between the [M(NHC)n\u22121] (n=2\u20134) fragment and the incoming NHC ligand, and 2)\u2005the strain energy (\u0394Estrain) associated with bending of the linear NHC-M-NHC arrangement. The key observation is that \u0394Estrain, which is an antagonist for higher coordination numbers, can significantly be lowered by M\u2192NHC \u03c0*-back-donation. This leads to favorable thermodynamics for n=3\u20134 for highly electrophilic metals in our study, and thus presents a general design motif to achieve coordination numbers beyond two. The scope of our findings extends beyond the NHC model systems and has wider implications for the synthesis of d10 [MLn] complexes and their catalytic activity."

  "description": "A Novel Platinum(II)-Based Bifunctional ADC Linker Benchmarked Using Zr-89-Desferal and Auristatin F-Conjugated TrastuzumabGreater control is desirable in the stochastic conjugation technology used to synthesize antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). We have shown recently that a fluorescent dye can be stably conjugated to a mAb using a bifunctional platinum(II) linker. Here, we describe the general applicability of this novel linker technology for the preparation of stable and efficacious ADCs. The ethylenediamine platinum(II) moiety, herein called Lx, was coordinated to Desferal (DFO) or auristatin F (AF) to provide storable \"semifinal\" products, which were directly conjugated to unmodified mAbs. Conjugation resulted in ADCs with unimpaired mAb-binding characteristics, DAR in the range of 2.5 to 2.7 and approximately 85% payload bound to the Fc region, presumably to histidine residues. To evaluate the in vivo stability of Lx and its effect on pharmacokinetics and tumor targeting of an ADC, Lx-DFO was conjugated to the HER2 mAb trastuzumab, followed by radiolabeling with 89Zr. Trastuzumab-Lx-DFO-98Zr was stable in vivo and exhibited pharmacokinetic and tumor-targeting properties similar to parental trastuzumab. In a xenograft mouse model of gastric cancer (NCI-N87) or an ado-trastuzumab emtansine-resistant breast cancer (JIMT-1), a single dose of trastuzumab-Lx-AF outperformed its maleimide benchmark trastuzumab-Mal-AF and FDA-approved ado-trastuzumab emtansine. Overall, our findings show the potential of the Lx technology as a robust conjugation platform for the preparation of anticancer ADCs."

Various strategies were employed to provide access to both enantiomers, which are versatile precursors of bioactive molecules. The regioselectivity of hydride addition on di-activated alkenes was elucidated by isotopic labeling experiments and showed strong preference for the keto moiety as activating/binding group as opposed to the ester. Finally, chemoenzymatic synthesis of (R)-2-(2-oxocyclohexyl)acetic acid was achieved in high ee on a preparative scale combining enzymatic reduction followed by ester hydrogenolysis."

  "description": "On the Origin of Surface Traps in Colloidal II\u2013VI Semiconductor NanocrystalsOne of the greatest challenges in the field of semiconductor nanomaterials is to make trap-free nanocrystalline structures to attain a remarkable improvement of their optoelectronic performances. In semiconductor nanomaterials, a very high number of atoms is located on the surface and these atoms form the main source of electronic traps. The relation between surface atom coordination and electronic structure, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we use density functional theory to unveil the surface structure/electronic property relations of zincblende II\u2013VI CdSe model nanocrystals, whose stoichiometry and surface termination agree with recent experimental findings. On the basis of the analysis of the surface geometry and the recent classification of the ligand surface coordination in terms of L-, X-, and Z-type ligands, we show that, contrary to expectations, most under-coordinated \u201cdangling\u201d atoms do not form traps and that L- and X-type ligands are benign to the nanocrystal electronic structure. On the other hand, we find clear evidence that Z-type displacement induces midgap states, localized on the 4p lone pair of 2-coordinated selenium surface atoms. We generalize our findings to the whole family of II\u2013VI metal chalcogenide nanocrystals of any size and shape and propose a new schematic representation of the chemical bond in metal chalcogenide nanocrystals that includes explicitly the coordination number of surface atoms. This work results in a detailed understanding of the formation of surface traps and provides a clear handle for further optimization of colloidal nanocrystals for optoelectronics applications."

  "description": "Natural excitation orbitals from linear response theories: Time-dependent density functional theory, time-dependent Hartree-Fock, and time-dependent natural orbital functional theoryStraightforward interpretation of excitations is possible if they can be described as simple single orbital-to-orbital (or double, etc.) transitions. In linear response time-dependent density functional theory (LR-TDDFT), the (ground state) Kohn-Sham orbitals prove to be such an orbital basis. In contrast, in a basis of natural orbitals (NOs) or Hartree-Fock orbitals, excitations often employ many orbitals and are accordingly hard to characterize. We demonstrate that it is possible in these cases to transform to natural excitation orbitals (NEOs) which resemble very closely the KS orbitals and afford the same simple description of excitations. The desired transformation has been obtained by diagonalization of a submatrix in the equations of linear response time-dependent 1-particle reduced density matrix functional theory (LR-TDDMFT) for the NO transformation, and that of a submatrix in the linear response time-dependent Hartree-Fock (LR-TDHF) equations for the transformation of HF orbitals. The corresponding submatrix is already diagonal in the KS basis in the LR-TDDFT equations. While the orbital shapes of the NEOs afford the characterization of the excitations as (mostly) simple orbital-to-orbital transitions, the orbital energies provide a fair estimate of excitation energies."

  "description": "Eight-coordinate fluoride in a silicate double-four-ringFluoride, nature's smallest anion, is capable of covalently coordinating to eight silicon atoms. The setting is a simple and common motif in zeolite chemistry: the box-shaped silicate double-four-ring (D4R). Fluoride seeks its center. It is the strain of box deformation that keeps fluoride in the middle of the box, and freezes what would be a transition state in its absence. Hypervalent bonding ensues. Fluoride's compactness works to its advantage in stabilizing the cage; chloride, bromide, and iodide do not bring about stabilization due to greater steric repulsion with the box frame. The combination of strain and hypervalent bonding, and the way they work in concert to yield this unusual case of multiple hypervalence, has potential for extension to a broader range of solidstate compounds."

In the current study six in vitro bioassays indicative of different mechanisms of thyroid disruption and one whole animal in vivo assay were applied to 9 model compounds and 4 different water samples (treated wastewater, surface water, drinking water and ultra-pure lab water; both unspiked and spiked with model compounds) to determine their ability to detect thyroid active compounds. Most assays correctly identified and quantified the model compounds as agonists or antagonists, with the reporter gene assays being the most sensitive. However, the reporter gene assays did not detect significant thyroid activity in any of the water samples, suggesting that activation or inhibition of the thyroid hormone receptor is not a relevant mode of action for thyroid endocrine disruptors in water. The thyroperoxidase (TPO) inhibition assay and transthyretin (TTR) displacement assay (FITC) detected activity in the surface water and treated wastewater samples, but more work is required to assess if this activity is a true measure of thyroid activity or matrix interference. The whole animal Xenopus Embryonic Thyroid Assay (XETA) detected some activity in the unspiked surface water and treated wastewater extracts, but not in unspiked drinking water, and appears to be a suitable assay to detect thyroid activity in environmental waters."

  "description": "Development of a surface plasmon resonance sensor for coupling to capillary electrophoresis allowing affinity assessment of protein mixture componentsSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) currently is the major platform to study protein\u2013protein interactions, but it lacks the selectivity to distinguish between binding components within one sample. Capillary electrophoresis (CE) can provide efficient separation of intact proteins under near-physiological conditions. We have hyphenated CE with SPR to achieve affinity assessment of mixture components. A microfluidic flow cell allowing straightforward coupling of CE and SPR was developed. Initial testing with non-interacting dyes showed good performance using a flow-cell channel volume of 100nL until the detection point. Appropriate closing of the CE electric circuit was achieved using the SPR gold-sensor as grounding electrode. Division of the (bio)sensor into an electrode part (providing grounding) and a detection part (bearing the affinity surface) was crucial to avoid disturbance of the SPR signal by the CE voltage. This approach permitted CE separation and binding assessment for separation voltages up to 30kV. Human serum albumin (HSA) or aprotinin were immobilized on carboxymethyldextran hydrogel-coated gold sensors and target proteins (anti-HSA, and trypsin and \u03b1-chymotrypsin, respectively) were analyzed. Efficient CE separation of the intact protein analytes was accomplished under native conditions by employing neutral and positively-charged capillary coatings. Selective binding of separated proteins to the target surface could be monitored by SPR down to 2ng of injected protein. Regeneration of the biosensor surface was achieved by an on-line rising, allowing repeatable CE-SPR analyses of proteins with RSDs below 1% and 5% for migration time and signal intensity, respectively."

In our previous research we revealed the pronounced genetic diversity in MAH by identifying eight different types of a newly described genomic island. In order to identify mechanisms of such horizontal gene transfer we now analyzed the ability of 47 MAH isolates to inherit the conjugative plasmid pRAW from M. marinum. A higher percentage of environmental isolates (22.7%) compared to clinical isolates (8%) had the capacity to function as recipient in conjugal plasmid transfer. Genetic analysis showed additionally that environmental isolates contained more genes homologous to genes present on conjugative mycobacterial plasmids than clinical isolates. Comparative analysis of the genomes of the isolates pointed to a possible association between the ability to act as recipient in conjugation and the structure of a genomic region containing the radC gene and a type I restriction/modification system. Finally we found that uptake of pRAW decreased the resistance against various antibiotics."

  "description": "Preliminary studies on ligand-based design and evaluation of new mycobacterial ATP synthase inhibitorsBackground: Tuberculosis is a threat to humankind due to the development of resistance against the existing drugs, so new drugs are an absolute necessity. Neuroleptic phenothiazines were reported for antitubercular activity, but the associated antipsychotic effect restricted their antitubercular use. Objective: Novel mycobacterial ATP synthase inhibitors having structural similarity with phenothiazines were designed in an attempt to develop potent antitubercular agents with no or less side effects. Methods: The designed molecules were synthesized and screened against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb). The compounds with strongest growth inhibition of whole Mtb (S3, S4, S9, S10, and S16) were screened for ATP synthesis inhibition using inverted membrane vesicles from Mycobacterium smegmatis, and were also screened for blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and mammalian cell cytotoxicity to assess the possible side effects. Results: Among all the compounds, S9 and S10 were found to be the most active (6.25 \u00b5g/mL) against Mtb and were comparable to chlorpromazine (12.5 \u00b5g/mL). Moreover, the compounds inhibited ATP synthesis at IC50 of 14 and 10.4 \u00b5M, respectively. A better correlation between MIC and IC50 observed, indicated that the compounds acted through mycobacterial ATP synthase inhibition. The blood-brain barrier (BBB) crossing ability of the compounds (S9, S10) was found to be less, indicating diminished CNS side effects. The compounds (S3, S4, S9, S10, and S16) were also marked safe against mammalian VERO cells, as CC50 was > 102 \u00b5g/mL. Conclusion: The enhanced antitubercular activity with reduced BBB permeability exhibited by the compounds has good prospect to develop them as antitubercular drugs."

This study was carried out to determine the molecular dynamics simulation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors from Gnetum gnemon L. seed extract. Methods: Molecular dynamics simulation using AMBER was used. The simulation was set at 300 K as default temperature and 310 K, average human body temperature. The main parameters of this study were ligand-residue interaction, binding affinity, root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), hydrogen bonds analysis, molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA), and molecular mechanics generalized born surface area (MMGBSA). Results: In the simulation study, trans-resveratrol, trans-piceid, gnemonol M, gnemonoside B, viniferin and gnetin C had shown lower energy than HMG (PDB ID: MAH), the substrate of HMG-CoA Reductase. Free energy binding obtained from simulation was between 11.1 to -31.38 kcal/mol. Conclusion: The simulation at 310 K was preferable than 300 K as more interactions were performed and higher affinity was obtained."

  "description": "Optimizing separations in online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatographyOnline comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography has become an attractive option for the analysis of complex nonvolatile samples found in various fields (e.g. environmental studies, food, life, and polymer sciences). Two-dimensional liquid chromatography complements the highly popular hyphenated systems that combine liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Two-dimensional liquid chromatography is also applied to the analysis of samples that are not compatible with mass spectrometry (e.g. high-molecular-weight polymers), providing important information on the distribution of the sample components along chemical dimensions (molecular weight, charge, lipophilicity, stereochemistry, etc.). Also, in comparison with conventional one-dimensional liquid chromatography, two-dimensional liquid chromatography provides a greater separation power (peak capacity). Because of the additional selectivity and higher peak capacity, the combination of two-dimensional liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry allows for simpler mixtures of compounds to be introduced in the ion source at any given time, improving quantitative analysis by reducing matrix effects. In this review, we summarize the rationale and principles of two-dimensional liquid chromatography experiments, describe advantages and disadvantages of combining different selectivities and discuss strategies to improve the quality of two-dimensional liquid chromatography separations."

  "description": "Sleep extension is a feasible lifestyle intervention in free-living adults who are habitually short sleepers: A potential strategy for decreasing intake of free sugars? A randomized controlled pilot studyBackground: Evidence suggests that short sleep duration may be a newly identified modifiable risk factor for obesity, yet there is a paucity of studies to investigate this. Objective:We assessed the feasibility of a personalized sleep extension protocol in adults aged 18-64 ywho are habitually short sleepers (5 to<7 h), with sleep primarily measured by wrist actigraphy. In addition, we collected pilot data to assess the effects of extended sleep on dietary intake and quality measured by 7-d food diaries, resting and total energy expenditure, physical activity, and markers of cardiometabolic health. Design: Forty-two normal-weight healthy participants who were habitually short sleepers completed this free-living, 4-wk, paralleldesign randomized controlled trial. The sleep extension group (n = 21) received a behavioral consultation session targeting sleep hygiene. The control group (n = 21) maintained habitual short sleep. Results: Rates of participation, attrition, and compliance were 100%, 6.5%, and 85.7%, respectively. The sleep extension group significantly increased time in bed [0:55 hours:minutes (h:mm); 95% CI: 0:37, 1:12 h:mm], sleep period (0:47 h:mm; 95% CI: 0:29, 1:05 h:mm), and sleep duration (0:21 h:mm; 95% CI: 0:06, 0:36 h:mm) compared with the control group. Sleep extension led to reduced intake of free sugars (-9.6 g; 95% CI: -16.0, -3.1 g) compared with control (0.7 g; 95% CI: -5.7, 7.2 g) (P = 0.042). A sensitivity analysis in plausible reporters showed that the sleep extension group reduced intakes of fat (percentage), carbohydrates (grams), and free sugars (grams) in comparison to the control group. There were no significant differences between groups in markers of energy balance or cardiometabolic health. Conclusions: We showed the feasibility of extending sleep in adult short sleepers. Sleep extension led to reduced free sugar intakes and may be a viable strategy to facilitate limiting excessive consumption of free sugars in an obesity-promoting environment. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02787577."

  "description": "Sulfur cave (Romania), an extreme environment with microbial mats in a Co2-H2S/O2 gas chemocline dominated by mycobacteriaSulfur Cave (Puturosu Mountain, Romania) is an extreme environment, unique for displaying life in a gas chemocline. The lower part of the cave is filled with CO2, CH4, and H2S of mofettic origin, while the upper part contains air that floats above the heavier volcanic gasses. S\u00b0 and H2SO4 (from sulfur-oxidation) cover the cave wall at and below the CO2-H2S:O2 gas/gas interface. On the cave wall, near the interface the pH is <1 and unusual microbial biofilms occur on the rock\u2019s surface. We provide context information on the geology, mineralogy, chemistry and biology to better understand this unique environment. We have used X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy with EDAX capabilities, stable isotope analysis and 16S and 18S rDNA amplicon sequencing. The most common taxa in the microbial biofilms are Mycobacteria, Acidithiobacillus and Ferroplasmaceae. Liquid water in this system originates solely from condensation of water vapor onto the cave walls making inflow of organic carbon from outside unlikely. The most likely primary source of energy for this microbial community is sulfur oxidation with H2S and S\u00b0 as main reductants and atmospheric O2 as the main oxidant. Ferric iron from the rock surface is another potential oxidant. In Sulfur Cave, gaseous CO2 (from mofettic emission) maintains the stability of the gas chemocline. Sulfur Cave biofilms can help the search for extreme life in the subsurface, near volcanic systems on Earth and Mars. The Sulfur Cave example shows that a habitable environment can be established underground in gas chemoclines near CO2-dominated gas discharge zones, where it can have a steady supply of water and energy."

  "description": "Combining ex-ante LCA and EHS screening to assist green design: A case study of cellulose nanocrystal foamThe evaluation of environmental credentials for innovative products within the research and design phase of development presents a valuable yet challenging exploit. The research presented here aims to carry out the early-stage environmental assessment of a novel nano material \u2013 cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) foam by applying ex-ante life cycle assessment (LCA) supplemented by an environmental, health and safety (EHS) screening. LCA is applied to assess the cradle-to-factory gate environmental impacts along the R&D trajectory from the laboratory synthesis, conceptual design, bench-scale trial to the up-scaled process design. Non-renewable energy use (NREU), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and agricultural land occupation (ALO) are the three indicators analysed. The early-stage EHS screening provides a supplementary assessment since the toxicity information is usually missing in the ex-ante LCAs due to lack of information. The EHS screening was conducted in two steps: 1) the (eco)toxicological effects of CNC are analysed by applying in vivo zebrafish assays; and 2)A so-called \u201cblock list\u201d scan is performed where all substances used in the production of CNC foam are scanned against valid regulations. The LCA results demonstrate that technology upscaling leads to a steady environmental impact reduction. It is observed that for per kg studied CNC foam, both NREU and GHG emissions were reduced by a factor of 10 along the R&D trajectory from lab scale to upgraded process design, as a result of the design improvements associated with energy-intensive processes and process energy optimisation. Along the studied R&D trajectory the potential ALO was decreased by 83% primarily due to a more efficient recycling of ethanol. The block list scan did not yield highly concerned substances in the manufacturing process. The in vivo zebrafish assay provided valuable insight into the ecotoxicological effects of CNC pointing towards the need for a more rigorous assessment."

Among children delivered for maternal or fetal indications (n=148), obesity was associated with elevated concentrations of seven proteins on the 14th postnatal day. In multivariable models in the spontaneous indications subsample, elevated IL-6 on day 1 predicted obesity (odds ratio: 2.9; 95% confidence limits: 1.2, 6.8), while elevated VCAM-1 on day 14 predicted overweight at 2 years of age (odds ratio: 2.3; 95% confidence limits: 1.2, 4.3).CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, neonatal systemic inflammation preceded the onset of obesity, suggesting that inflammation might contribute to the development of obesity.Pediatric Research accepted article preview online, 15 December 2017. doi:10.1038/pr.2017.313."

These reactions proceed by multiple pathways and are inherently associated with a potentially large variation of reactants and functional groups. To date, theoretical chemistry has been used in hindsight to verify experimental observations. However, its use in the early stages of the development of a (multicomponent) reaction process can prevent laborious and time-consuming optimization studies by pinpointing the most relevant parameter(s) in the reactivity, thus focusing experimental efforts. Herein, we discuss a study that truly integrates theoretical and synthetic chemistry to unravel in full detail the complex and intricate reaction characteristics of the novel versatile MCR of \u03b1-acidic iso(thio)cyanates, amines and aldehydes to access densely functionalized imidazoline-2-(thi)ones."

More prospective epidemiological studies are needed to compliment the growing body of evidence from animal studies. Methods: Serum from 412 pregnant Norwegian and Swedish women participating in a Scandinavian prospective cohort study were collected in 1986-88, and analyses of two perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and five organochlorines (OCs) were conducted. We used linear and logistic regression models with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the associations between maternal serum POP concentrations at 17-20 weeks of gestation and child overweight/obesity (body mass index (BMI) \u2265 85th percentile) at 5-year follow-up. Results were further stratified by country after testing for effect modification. We also assessed potential non-monotonic dose-response (NMDR) relationships. Results: In adjusted linear models, we observed increased BMI-for-age-and-sex z-score (\u03b2 = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.01-0.35), and increased triceps skinfold z-score (\u03b2 = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.02-0.27) in children at 5-year follow-up per ln-unit increase in maternal serum perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) concentrations. We observed increased odds for child overweight/obesity (BMI \u2265 85th percentile) for each ln-unit increase in maternal serum PFOS levels (adjusted OR: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.11-3.74), with stronger odds among Norwegian children (OR: 2.96, 95% CI: 1.42-6.15). We found similar associations between maternal serum perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) concentrations and child overweight/obesity. We found indications of NMDR relationships between PFOS and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) 153 and child overweight/obesity among Swedish children. Conclusion: We found positive associations between maternal serum PFAS concentrations and child overweight/obesity at 5-year follow-up, particularly among Norwegian participants. We observed some evidence for NMDR relationships among Swedish participants."

  "description": "The Therapeutic Potential of PTEN Modulation: Targeting Strategies from Gene to ProteinTwo decades have passed since the discovery of the tumor suppressor, PTEN. A multitude of biological functions have since been revealed, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for both PTEN activation (e.g., cancer) and inhibition (e.g., neuroregeneration). Nevertheless, PTEN's therapeutic suitability has been called into question due to its \u201crisky\u201d profile as a tumor suppressor. To evaluate PTEN function and its various roles in disease a number of molecules have so far been developed. However, intrinsic problems associated with phosphatase inhibition and PTEN's complex regulation via post-translational modifications hinder straightforward access to selective modulators. For this reason, central questions associated with PTEN targeting remain unanswered. In this perspective, we summarize current PTEN-targeting strategies and discuss potential approaches to modulate its functional dose, considering all stages of PTEN biogenesis from direct protein modulation to the targeting of relevant miRNAs as well as the PTEN gene and mRNA"

  "description": "Altricial-precocial spectra in animal kingdomTraditionally, the terms altricial and precocial are used to described the state at birth of birds and mammals. We suggest an explanation for why birds evolved from precocial to altricial and mammals from altricial to precocial. However, the concept is not confined to these groups alone and is an important pattern underlying all animal metabolism. Being able to quantify it, helps position species in multi-dimensional diversity trait space. We here argue that a quantification of the state of development of an individual at birth, in the context of its life cycle, can best be done by comparison with the state at puberty. Two natural quantifiers for the altricial-precocial spectrum exist in the context of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory that are applicable to the whole animal kingdom: maturity and maturity density at birth divided by that at puberty. These quantities have been estimated, in combination with other parameters, for some 875 species belonging to all large phyla. We study how taxa are ranked according to both the maturity and maturity density ratios. We conclude that only the maturity ratio qualifies as quantifier for the altricial-precocial spectrum. We were able to retrieve known patterns in altriciality for birds and mammals, while the concept is now applicable to all animal taxa. This new quantifier for animal altriciality can be linked quantitatively to other properties. These linkages are studied by examining how maturity parameters interact with other DEB parameters and implied properties. With the exception of mammals, cartilaginous fish and insects, bigger-bodied species show a clear tendency for to be more frequently altricial. We discuss possible explanations. Age at birth as fraction of age at puberty was found to be proportional to the maturity ratio to the power 1/3; this is consistent with DEB's co-variation rules, but does not follow from them. Maturity at puberty follows a Weibull distribution with great accuracy while that at birth does not, which is consistent with the idea that Weibull distributions can be expected when many factors contribute. We found that species from all taxa with a very high allocation fraction to soma, tend to have low maturities at birth and puberty. We discuss the possible implications of these patterns."

  "description": "Body size as emergent property of metabolismBody size is not an independent variable, but an emergent property: the result of a number of inter-linked eco-physiological processes, like most other quantities that we can measure on organisms. Organisms do not have a particular body size. They are born small and grow to larger sizes during their life trajectory, while changing properties during the growth process in interaction with the environment. The use of maximum body mass of a species as an independent variable when analyzing some other trait, bypasses the important question: What factors control maximum body mass and how do these factors affect the trait of interest? We argue that the old, famous question of why weight-specific respiration decreases for increasing maximum body mass of species was difficult to explain because ecological literature typically treats body size as an independent variable. We demonstrate that Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory could explain this phenomenon by treating body size as an emergent property. The question of why specific respiration decreases with increasing body size then translates to the question of why specific assimilation and/or specific maintenance would vary among species. We discuss the four parameters that control maximum body weight in the DEB theory and study how they co-vary. One of these parameters, the allocation fraction to soma, turned out to follow a beta distribution in the Add-my-Pet collection, with perplexing accuracy. We found the explanation after discovering that the supply stress, i.e. maturity maintenance times squared somatic maintenance divided by cubed assimilation, also followed a (scaled) beta distribution. The allocation fraction can be written as the ratio of somatic maintenance and assimilation for fully-grown individuals and we found that these rates turn out to follow Weibull distributions. Beta-distributions are known to result from appropriate ratios of gamma-distributed variables and we demonstrate that this also applies, to a very good approximation, for ratios of Weibull-distributed variables. We noticed similarities between Weibull distributions and allometric functions and suggest that they fit data well because many factors contribute to the underlying processes. This explains why the allocation fraction, the supply stress and some other ratios of fluxes follow beta distributions. We support our findings with empirical data."

  "description": "Comparative physiological energetics of Mediterranean and North Atlantic loggerhead turtlesPopulation of loggerhead turtles nesting in the Mediterranean Sea has probably evolved from the North Atlantic (NA) population, but is geographically and genetically distinct. We aggregated previously published and new unpublished data, and took two approaches to comparing these populations: an empirical one based on statistical analyses of morphological data, and a physiological one based on a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model. We then analyzed causes of faster growth and maturation, but smaller size at puberty and ultimate size of the Mediterranean (MED) loggerhead turtles relative to their NA conspecifics. The empirical analysis shows that MED eggs, hatchlings, and nesting adults are consistently smaller in terms of length and mass. The physiological approach suggests physiological adaptations of the MED population to higher salinity and scarcer food availability. In particular, these adaptations include an increase in somatic maintenance needs, and a decrease in energy investment to reach and maintain sexual maturity. Our study therefore offers a mechanistic underpinning of previously observed but unexplained life-history traits, and showcases an application of DEB theory as a tool for comparative analysis of two distinct populations of the same species."

  "description": "Fitting multiple models to multiple data setsDynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory constitutes a coherent set of universal biological processes that have been used as building blocks for modeling biological systems over the last 40 years in many applied disciplines. In the context of extracting parameters for DEB models from data, we discuss the methodology of fitting multiple models, which share parameters, to multiple data sets in a single parameter estimation. This problem is not specific to DEB models, and is (or should be) really general in biology. We discovered that a lot of estimation problems that we suffered from in the past originated from the use of a loss function that was not symmetric in the role of data and predictions. We here propose two much better symmetric candidates, that proved to work well in practice. We illustrate estimation problems and their solutions with a Monte-Carlo case study for increasing amount of scatter, which decreased the amount of information in the data about one or more parameter values. We here validate the method using a set of models with known parameters and different scatter structures. We compare the loss functions on the basis of convergence, point and interval estimates. We also discuss the use of pseudo-data, i.e. realistic values for parameters that we treat as data from which predictions can differ. These pseudo-data are used to avoid that a good fit results in parameter values that make no biological sense. We discuss our new method for estimating confidence intervals and present a list of concrete recommendations for parameter estimation. We conclude that the proposed method performs very well in recovering parameter values of a set of models, applied to a set of data. This is consistent with our large-scale applications in practice."

  "description": "Life in the slow lane? A dynamic energy budget model for the western swamp turtle, Pseudemydura umbrinaDynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides a generalised way to quantify how an organism assimilates and utilizes energy throughout its life cycle. Over 800 DEB models have been created to date, typically under the assumption of constant food supply. The Critically Endangered, semi-aquatic western swamp turtle occupies an ephemeral wetland environment in which food resources fluctuate from abundant to absent with the seasonal filling and drying of swamps. Approximately six months of each year are spent in aestivation underground when the swamps are dry and conditions are warm. We estimated DEB parameters for the western swamp turtle with the explicit incorporation of these seasonal fluctuations in food and temperature. A metabolic depression factor was applied during the aestivation stage, without which turtles lost both mass and length, and reserves were insufficient to reach puberty. The swamp turtle had a very high Arrhenius temperature, being almost 2.5-fold greater than that of the other Testudine species for which there are DEB models (typical Arrhenius temperatures are around 8000 K; western swamp turtle is 19,371 K). It also had the second highest somatic maintenance costs of the reptiles in the DEB \u2018Add My Pet\u2019 collection, and the highest for Testudines. We explore these results in context of the \u201cwaste to hurry\u201d hypothesis, which we suggest may apply for this species. We also consider how a DEB model for this species might be applied in its future conservation and management."

  "description": "Why big-bodied animal species cannot evolve a waste-to-hurry strategyReserve capacity quantifies the ability of an animal to smooth out fluctuations in food availability. It is defined as the maximum reserve density, and can be quantified through the application of the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. In this study, we analyze inter-specific patterns in DEB parameters of 1041 animal species, focusing on those that control reserve capacity (maximum specific assimilation and energy conductance) and maintenance. The co-variation rules of DEB theory expect that specific somatic maintenance and energy conductance are independent of maximum structural length, with the implication that reserve capacity is proportional to maximum structural length among species and independent of somatic maintenance. We found however that the reserve density increases with somatic maintenance among all large animal taxa in the collection: invertebrates, fish and amphibians, sauropsids and mammals. The waste-to-hurry phenomenon implies that small-bodied species frequently have both a higher specific maintenance and higher specific assimilation (with respect to larger species) allowing them to boost growth and reproduction. If waste-to-hurry strategists would increase both parameters in proportion, maximum structural length would not be affected, reserve capacity would become proportional to somatic maintenance and its relationship with maximum structural length would depend on quantitative details. We did find a positive relationship between reserve capacity and specific somatic maintenance, but the increase (as an average over all taxa) is less than proportional. The reason is that specific assimilation is less than proportional to specific somatic maintenance, the scaling parameter roughly being 0.8, while energy conductance hardly depends on somatic maintenance. The implication is that maximum assimilation is proportional to structural length to the power \u2212 0.7, which explains why the waste-to-hurry strategy is not a viable route for big-bodied species: they would need more assimilates than small-bodied ones, not less. We discuss applications of these findings in the context of parameter estimation. As a side-result we also found that birds have a higher specific somatic maintenance and also a higher (mean) energy conductance, compared to other sauropsids at the same body temperature. The first is to be expected because they are demand species, the latter might be an adaptation to flight: reserve density increases for decreasing energy conductance, while it contributes to weight."

  "description": "Characterizing export of land-based microplastics to the estuary - Part II: Sensitivity analysis of an integrated geospatial microplastic transport modeling assessment of tire and road wear particlesIntegrated models addressing microplastic (MP) generation, terrestrial distribution, and freshwater transport are useful tools characterizing the export of MP to marine waters. In Part I of this study, a baseline watershed-scale MP mass balance model was developed for tire and road wear particles (TRWP) in the Seine watershed. In Part II, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis (SA) methods were used to identify the parameters that determine the transport of these particles to the estuary. Local differential, local range and global first-order variance-based SA identified similar key parameters. The global SA (1000 Monte Carlo simulations) indicated that most of the variance in TRWP exported to the estuary can be apportioned to TRWP diameter (76%), TRWP density (5.6%), the fraction of TRWP directed to combined sewers with treatment (3.9%), and the fraction of TRWP distributed to runoff (versus roadside soil; 2.2%). The export fraction was relatively insensitive to heteroaggregation processes and the rainfall intensity threshold for road surface washoff. The fraction of TRWP exported to estuary in the probabilistic assessment was centered on the baseline estimate of 2%. This fraction ranged from 1.4 to 4.9% (central tendency defined as 25th to 75th percentile) and 0.97% to 13% (plausible upper bound defined as 10th to 90th percentiles). This study emphasizes the importance of in situ characterization of TRWP diameter and density, and confirms the baseline mass balance presented in Part I, which indicated an appreciable potential for capture of TRWP in freshwater sediment."

  "description": "Checks and balances in bacterial cell divisionAssembly of the division machinery in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria occurs in two time-dependent steps. First, the FtsZ proto-ring localizes at midcell including some FtsN molecules. Subsequently, the proteins that catalyze and regulate septal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis are recruited including among others, the FtsBLQ-PB1B-FtsW-PBP3 complex. Further accumulation of FtsN finally allows initiation of cell division. It was known that FtsA and FtsQLB somehow prevented this initiation. Recently, A. Boes, S. Olatunji, E. Breukink, and M. Terrak (mBio 10:e01912-18, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01912-18) reported that this is caused by inhibition of the activity of the PG synthases by FtsBLQ, which has to be outcompeted by accumulation of the PBP1b activating FtsN. This supports a central structural as well as regulatory role for the FtsBLQ protein complex that is conserved only in prokaryotes, making it an attractive target for antibiotic development."

However, attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains may provide more representative, safer models to study M. tuberculosis biology. For example, the M. tuberculosis \u0394leuD\u0394panCD double auxotroph, has undergone rigorous in vitro and in vivo safety testing. Like other auxotrophic strains, this has subsequently been approved for use in biosafety level (BSL) 2 facilities. Auxotrophic strains have been assessed as models for drug-resistant M. tuberculosis and for studying latent TB. These offer the potential as safe and useful models, but it is important to understand how well these recapitulate salient features of non-attenuated M. tuberculosis. We therefore performed a comprehensive comparison of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. tuberculosis\u0394leuD\u0394panCD. These strains demonstrated similar in vitro and intra-macrophage replication rates, similar responses to anti-TB agents and whole genome sequence conservation. Shotgun proteomics analysis suggested that M. tuberculosis\u0394leuD\u0394panCD has a heightened stress response that leads to reduced bacterial replication during exposure to acid stress, which has been verified using a dual-fluorescent replication reporter assay. Importantly, infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the 2 strains elicited comparable cytokine production, demonstrating the suitability of M. tuberculosis\u0394leuD\u0394panCD for immunological assays. We provide comprehensive evidence to support the judicious use of M. tuberculosis\u0394leuD\u0394panCD as a safe and suitable model organism for M. tuberculosis research, without the need for a BSL3 facility."

  "description": "Computer-aided gradient optimization of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic separations of intact proteins and protein glycoformsProtein glycosylation is one of the most common and critical post-translational modification, which results from covalent attachment of carbohydrates to protein backbones. Glycosylation affects the physicochemical properties of proteins and potentially their function. Therefore it is important to establish analytical methods which can resolve glycoforms of glycoproteins. Recently, hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-mass spectrometry has demonstrated to be a useful tool for the efficient separation and characterization of intact protein glycoforms. In particular, amide-based stationary phases in combination with acetonitrile-water gradients containing ion-pairing agents, have been used for the characterization of glycoproteins. However, finding the optimum gradient conditions for glycoform resolution can be quite tedious as shallow gradients (small decrease of acetonitrile percentage in the elution solvent over a long time)are required. In the present study, the retention mechanism and peak capacity of HILIC for non-glycosylated and glycosylated proteins were investigated and compared to reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). For both LC modes, ln k vs. \u03c6 plots of a series of test proteins were calculated using linear solvent strength (LSS)analysis. For RPLC, the plots were spread over a wider \u03c6 range than for HILIC, suggesting that HILIC methods require shallower gradients to resolve intact proteins. Next, the usefulness of computer-aided method development for the optimization of the separation of intact glycoform by HILIC was examined. Five retention models including LSS, adsorption, and mixed-mode, were tested to describe and predict glycoprotein retention under gradient conditions. The adsorption model appeared most suited and was applied to the gradient prediction for the separation of the glycoforms of six glycoproteins (Ides-digested trastuzumab, alpha-acid glycoprotein, ovalbumin, fetuin and thyroglobulin)employing the program PIOTR. Based on the results of three scouting gradients, conditions for high-efficiency separations of protein glycoforms varying in the degree and complexity of glycosylation was achieved, thereby significantly reducing the time needed for method optimization."

  "description": "Development of a neurotoxicity assay that is tuned to detect mitochondrial toxicantsMany neurotoxicants affect energy metabolism in man, but currently available test methods may still fail to predict mito- and neurotoxicity. We addressed this issue using LUHMES cells, i.e., human neuronal precursors that easily differentiate into mature neurons. Within the NeuriTox assay, they have been used to screen for neurotoxicants. Our new approach is based on culturing the cells in either glucose or galactose (Glc\u2013Gal\u2013NeuriTox) as the main carbohydrate source during toxicity testing. Using this Glc\u2013Gal\u2013NeuriTox assay, 52 mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial toxicants were tested. The panel of chemicals comprised 11 inhibitors of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (cI), 4 inhibitors of cII, 8 of cIII, and 2 of cIV; 8 toxicants were included as they are assumed to be mitochondrial uncouplers. In galactose, cells became more dependent on mitochondrial function, which made them 2\u20133 orders of magnitude more sensitive to various mitotoxicants. Moreover, galactose enhanced the specific neurotoxicity (destruction of neurites) compared to a general cytotoxicity (plasma membrane lysis) of the toxicants. The Glc\u2013Gal\u2013NeuriTox assay worked particularly well for inhibitors of cI and cIII, while the toxicity of uncouplers and non-mitochondrial toxicants did not differ significantly upon glucose \u2194 galactose exchange. As a secondary assay, we developed a method to quantify the inhibition of all mitochondrial respiratory chain functions/complexes in LUHMES cells. The combination of the Glc\u2013Gal\u2013NeuriTox neurotoxicity screening assay with the mechanistic follow up of target site identification allowed both, a more sensitive detection of neurotoxicants and a sharper definition of the mode of action of mitochondrial toxicants."

  "description": "Distinct requirements for tail-anchored membrane protein biogenesis in escherichia coliTail-anchored membrane proteins (TAMPs) are a distinct subset of inner membrane proteins (IMPs) characterized by a single C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD) that is responsible for both targeting and anchoring. Little is known about the routing of TAMPs in bacteria. Here, we have investigated the role of TMD hydrophobicity in tail-anchor function in Escherichia coli and its influence on the choice of targeting/insertion pathway. We created a set of synthetic, fluorescent TAMPs that vary in the hydrophobicity of their TMDs and corresponding control polypeptides that are extended at their C terminus to create regular type II IMPs. Surprisingly, we observed that TAMPs have a much lower TMD hydrophobicity threshold for efficient targeting and membrane insertion than their type II counterparts. Using strains conditional for the expression of known membrane-targeting and insertion factors, we show that TAMPs with strongly hydrophobic TMDs require the signal recognition particle (SRP) for targeting. Neither the SecYEG translocon nor YidC appears to be essential for the membrane insertion of any of the TAMPs studied. In contrast, corresponding type II IMPs with a TMD of sufficient hydrophobicity to promote membrane insertion followed an SRP- and SecYEG translocon-dependent pathway. Together, these data indicate that the capacity of a TMD to promote the biogenesis of E. coli IMPs is strongly dependent upon the polypeptide context in which it is presented."

The two drugs in current use, benznidazole and nifurtimox, require long treatment regimens, show limited efficacy in the chronic phase of infection, and are known to cause adverse effects. Phenotypic screening of an in-house library led to the identification of 2,2\u2032-methylenebis(5-(4-bromophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one), a phenyldihydropyrazolone dimer, which shows an in vitro pIC50 value of 5.4 against Trypanosoma cruzi. Initial optimization was done by varying substituents of the phenyl ring, after which attempts were made to replace the phenyl ring. Finally, the linker between the dimer units was varied, ultimately leading to 2,2\u2032-methylenebis(5-(3-bromo-4-methoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one (NPD-0228) as the most potent analogue. NPD-0228 has an in vitro pIC50 value of 6.4 against intracellular amastigotes of T. cruzi and no apparent toxicity against the human MRC-5 cell line and murine cardiac cells."

  "description": "Implications of microbial adaptation for the assessment of environmental persistence of chemicalsPersistency of organic chemicals is a key property in their environmental risk assessment. Information on persistency is often derived from the results of biodegradability screening tests such as the ready biodegradability tests (RBTs). RBTs are, however, not designed for this purpose and suffer from several problems that lead to a high variability of the results and, hence, to difficulties in their interpretation. The origin and exposure history of the inocula used for biodegradability testing can lead to highly variable outcomes. Microbial adaptation to chemicals and its impact on biodegradation needs further investigation in order to have a better understanding of their effects on persistency assessments of chemicals. It is well described that microbial adaptation stimulates biodegradation of organic chemicals. Several mechanisms responsible for these phenomena have been described, amongst which are i) shifts in community composition or abundances, ii) mutations within populations, iii) horizontal gene transfer or iv) recombination events. These adaptation processes may well be mimicked under laboratory conditions, but the outcome remains difficult to predict as we lack a fundamental understanding of the adaptive responses. This review aims to bring together our current knowledge regarding microbial adaptation and its implication for the testing of biodegradation of chemicals."

  "description": "Multifunctional toxins in snake venoms and therapeutic implications: From pain to hemorrhage and necrosisAnimal venoms have evolved over millions of years for prey capture and defense from predators and rivals. Snake venoms, in particular, have evolved a wide diversity of peptides and proteins that induce harmful inflammatory and neurotoxic effects including severe pain and paralysis, hemotoxic effects, such as hemorrhage and coagulopathy, and cytotoxic/myotoxic effects, such as inflammation and necrosis. If untreated, many envenomings result in death or severe morbidity in humans and, despite advances in management, snakebite remains a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries. Consequently, the World Health Organization recently recognized snakebite as a neglected tropical disease that affects ~2.7 million p.a. The major protein classes found in snake venoms are phospholipases, metalloproteases, serine proteases, and three-finger peptides. The mechanisms of action and pharmacological properties of many snake venom toxins have been elucidated, revealing a complex multifunctional cocktail that can act synergistically to rapidly immobilize prey and deter predators. However, despite these advances many snake toxins remain to be structurally and pharmacologically characterized. In this review, the multifunctional features of the peptides and proteins found in snake venoms, as well as their evolutionary histories, are discussed with the view to identifying novel modes of action and improving snakebite treatments."

  "description": "Nanobody-Targeted Photodynamic Therapy Selectively Kills Viral GPCR-Expressing Glioblastoma CellsPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) eradicates tumors by the local activation of a photosensitizer with near-infrared light. One of the aspects hampering the clinical use of PDT is the poor selectivity of the photosensitizer. To improve this, we have recently introduced a new approach for targeted PDT by conjugating photosensitizers to nanobodies. Diverse G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) show aberrant overexpression in tumors and are therefore interesting targets in cancer therapy. Here we show that GPCR-targeting nanobodies can be used in targeted PDT. We have developed a nanobody binding the extracellular side of the viral GPCR US28, which is detected in tumors like glioblastoma. The nanobody was site-directionally conjugated to the water-soluble photosensitizer IRDye700DX. This nanobody-photosensitizer conjugate selectively killed US28-expressing glioblastoma cells both in 2D and 3D cultures upon illumination with near-infrared light. This is the first example employing a GPCR as target for nanobody-directed PDT. With the emerging role of GPCRs in cancer, this data provides a new angle for exploiting this large family of receptors for targeted therapies."

  "description": "Natural Microbial Communities Can Be Manipulated by Artificially Constructed BiofilmsBiofouling proceeds in successive steps where the primary colonizers affect the phylogenetic and functional structure of a future microbial consortium. Using microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) as a study case, a novel approach for material surface protection is described, which does not prevent biofouling, but rather shapes the process of natural biofilm development to exclude MIC-related microorganisms. This approach interferes with the early steps of natural biofilm formation affecting how the community is finally developed. It is based on a multilayer artificial biofilm, composed of electrostatically modified bacterial cells, producing antimicrobial compounds, extracellular antimicrobial polyelectrolyte matrix, and a water-proof rubber elastomer barrier. The artificial biofilm is constructed layer-by-layer (LBL) by manipulating the electrostatic interactions between microbial cells and material surfaces. Field testing on standard steel coupons exposed in the sea for more than 30 days followed by laboratory analyses using molecular-biology tools demonstrate that the preapplied artificial biofilm affects the phylogenetic structure of the developing natural biofilm, reducing phylogenetic diversity and excluding MIC-related bacteria. This sustainable solution for material protection showcases the usefulness of artificially guiding microbial evolutionary processes via the electrostatic modification and controlled delivery of bacterial cells and extracellular matrix to the exposed material surfaces."

A thorough density functional theory-energy decomposition analysis studyFor a series of organonitrile [RCN (R = Me, CF3, Ph, CH3Ph, CF3Ph)] ligands, the nature of the N-Pt bond in the related cis-/trans-(RCN)2PtCl2 complexes has been computationally investigated by Density Functional Theory. A fragment based bond analysis has been performed in the canonical Kohn-Sham molecular orbitals framework, and it has been ultimately assessed that this bond is characterized both by N\u2192Pt \u03c3 and by N\u2190Pt \u03c0 contributions. Voronoi Deformation Density charges further confirms the occurrence of N\u2190Pt \u03c0 interactions. Moreover, the Energy Decomposition Analysis-Natural Orbital for Chemical Valence (EDA-NOCV) method shows that the strength of the N\u2190Pt \u03c0 interaction is not negligible by contributing to about 30-40% of the total orbital interaction. Finally, the well-known \u03bdCN blue-shift occurring upon coordination to PtII, has been thoroughly investigated by exploiting the EDA-NOCV and by evaluating \u03bdCN and force constants. The origin of the \u03bdCN blue-shift in these systems has been discussed on the basis of the CN bond polarization. N\u2190Pt \u03c0 backbonding causes only a systematic decrease of the observed \u03bdCN blue-shift when compared to the one calculated for RCN-X (X = H+, alkaline, Lewis acids) herein reported (X = purely \u03c3 acceptors)."

  "description": "PyFrag 2019\u2014Automating the exploration and analysis of reaction mechanismsWe present a substantial update to the PyFrag 2008 program, which was originally designed to perform a fragment-based activation strain analysis along a provided potential energy surface. The original PyFrag 2008 workflow facilitated the characterization of reaction mechanisms in terms of the intrinsic properties, such as strain and interaction, of the reactants. The new PyFrag 2019 program has automated and reduced the time-consuming and laborious task of setting up, running, analyzing, and visualizing computational data from reaction mechanism studies to a single job. PyFrag 2019 resolves three main challenges associated with the automated computational exploration of reaction mechanisms: it (1) computes the reaction path by carrying out multiple parallel calculations using initial coordinates provided by the user; (2) monitors the entire workflow process; and (3) tabulates and visualizes the final data in a clear way. The activation strain and canonical energy decomposition results that are generated relate the characteristics of the reaction profile in terms of intrinsic properties (strain, interaction, orbital overlaps, orbital energies, populations) of the reactant species."

  "description": "Taxonomic and functional characterization of the microbial community during spontaneous in vitro fermentation of riesling mustAlthough there is an extensive tradition of research into the microbes that underlie the winemaking process, much remains to be learnt. We combined the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) tools of metabarcoding and metagenomics, to characterize how microbial communities of Riesling musts sampled at four different vineyards, and their subsequent spontaneously fermented derivatives, vary. We specifically explored community variation relating to three points: (i) how microbial communities vary by vineyard; (ii) how community biodiversity changes during alcoholic fermentation; and (iii) how microbial community varies between musts that successfully complete alcoholic fermentation and those that become 'stuck' in the process. Our metabarcoding data showed a general influence of microbial composition at the vineyard level. Two of the vineyards (4 and 5) had strikingly a change in the differential abundance of Metschnikowia. We therefore additionally performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on a subset of the samples to provide preliminary insights into the potential relevance of this observation, and used the data to both investigate functional potential and reconstruct draft genomes (bins). At these two vineyards, we also observed an increase in non-Saccharomycetaceae fungal functions, and a decrease in bacterial functions during the early fermentation stage. The binning results yielded 11 coherent bins, with both vineyards sharing the yeast bins Hanseniaspora and Saccharomyces. Read recruitment and functional analysis of this data revealed that during fermentation, a high abundance of Metschnikowia might serve as a biocontrol agent against bacteria, via a putative iron depletion pathway, and this in turn could help Saccharomyces dominate the fermentation. During alcoholic fermentation, we observed a general decrease in biodiversity in both the metabarcoding and metagenomic data. Unexpected Micrococcus behavior was observed in vineyard 4 according to metagenomic analyses based on reference-based read mapping. Analysis of open reading frames using these data showed an increase of functions assigned to class Actinobacteria in the end of fermentation. Therefore, we hypothesize that bacteria might sit-and-wait until Saccharomyces activity slows down. Complementary approaches to annotation instead of relying a single database provide more coherent information true species. Lastly, our metabarcoding data enabled us to identify a relationship between stuck fermentations and Starmerella abundance. Given that robust chemical analysis indicated that although the stuck samples contained residual glucose, all fructose had been consumed, we hypothesize that this was because fructophilic Starmerella, rather than Saccharomyces, dominated these fermentations. Overall, our results showcase the different ways in which metagenomic analyses can improve our understanding of the wine alcoholic fermentation process."

We find that the reactivity trend of cycloalkenediones toward tetrazine is opposite to cycloalkenes. The electrostatic interactions between the cycloalkenediones and tetrazine become more stabilizing as the ring size of the cycloalkenediones increases, resulting in lower activation energies. The origin of the more favorable electrostatic interactions and the accelerated reactivities of larger cycloalkenediones result from a stabilizing CH/\u03c0 interaction that is not present in the reaction of the 4-membered cycloalkenedione. The Diels-Alder reactivity trend of cycloalkenediones toward tetrazine is opposite that of cycloalkenes. The increased reactivity of the 5- and 6-membered cycloalkenediones relative to the 4-membered cycloalkenedione is attributed to a stabilizing electrostatic CH/\u03c0 interaction that is not present in the reaction of the 4-membered cycloalkenedione.

In this paper, we present the results of a multi-year intervention whereby dairy farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs were taught to convert their milk into a probiotic yoghurt using an innovative bacterial starter culture and basic equipment. This intervention creates additional sources of income and employment for people involved in the delivery of milk as well as production, distribution, and sales of yoghurt. Besides the economic benefits, the consumption of the probiotic yoghurt can contribute to reduction of the incidence and severity of diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, atopic diseases, alleviate the symptoms of stomach ulcers, and decrease the uptake of aflatoxins in the body. With minimal external financial support, 116 communities or small entrepreneurs have been able to start, expand, and maintain a business by production and sales of probiotic yoghurt. Applied business models and success rate in terms of revenues and profitability varied per region and depended on location, culture, ownership structure, wealth status, and gender."

  "description": "Adaption to glucose limitation is modulated by the pleotropic regulator CcpA, independent of selection pressure strengthBackground: A central theme in (micro)biology is understanding the molecular basis of fitness i.e. which strategies are successful under which conditions; how do organisms implement such strategies at the molecular level; and which constraints shape the trade-offs between alternative strategies. Highly standardized microbial laboratory evolution experiments are ideally suited to approach these questions. For example, prolonged chemostats provide a constant environment in which the growth rate can be set, and the adaptive process of the organism to such environment can be subsequently characterized. Results: We performed parallel laboratory evolution of Lactococcus lactis in chemostats varying the quantitative value of the selective pressure by imposing two different growth rates. A mutation in one specific amino acid residue of the global transcriptional regulator of carbon metabolism, CcpA, was selected in all of the evolution experiments performed. We subsequently showed that this mutation confers predictable fitness improvements at other glucose-limited growth rates as well. In silico protein structural analysis of wild type and evolved CcpA, as well as biochemical and phenotypic assays, provided the underpinning molecular mechanisms that resulted in the specific reprogramming favored in constant environments. Conclusion: This study provides a comprehensive understanding of a case of microbial evolution and hints at the wide dynamic range that a single fitness-enhancing mutation may display. It demonstrates how the modulation of a pleiotropic regulator can be used by cells to improve one trait while simultaneously work around other limiting constraints, by fine-tuning the expression of a wide range of cellular processes."

  "description": "Rationalizing and Controlling the Surface Structure and Electronic Passivation of Cesium Lead Halide NanocrystalsColloidal lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have recently emerged as versatile photonic sources. Their processing and luminescent properties are challenged by the lability of their surfaces, i.e., the interface of the NC core and the ligand shell. On the example of CsPbBr3 NCs, we model the nanocrystal surface structure and its effect on the emergence of trap states using density functional theory. We rationalize the typical observation of a degraded luminescence upon aging or the luminescence recovery upon postsynthesis surface treatments. The conclusions are corroborated by the elemental analysis. We then propose a strategy for healing the surface trap states and for improving the colloidal stability by the combined treatment with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide and lead bromide and validate this approach experimentally. This simple procedure results in robust colloids, which are highly pure and exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields of up to 95-98%, retained even after three to four rounds of washing."

Over the years, several different cyclooctyne derivatives have been developed and investigated in regard to their reactivity in SPAAC reactions with azides. However, only a few studies examined the influence of structurally diverse azides on reaction kinetics. Herein, we report our investigations of the reactivity of primary, secondary, and tertiary azides with the cyclooctynes BCN and ADIBO applying experimental and computational methods. All azides show similar reaction rates with the sterically non-demanding cyclooctyne BCN. However, due to the increased steric demand of the dibenzocyclooctyne ADIBO, the reactivity of tertiary azides drops by several orders of magnitude in comparison to primary and secondary azides. We show that this chemoselective behavior of tertiary azides can be exploited to achieve semiorthogonal dual-labeling without the need for any catalyst using SPAAC exclusively."

  "description": "Experimental design and measurement uncertainty in ligand binding studies by affinity capillary electrophoresisIn all life sciences ligand binding assays (LBAs) play a crucial role. Unfortunately these are very error prone. One part of this uncertainty results from the unavoidable random measurement uncertainty, another part can be attributed to the experimental design. To investigate the latter, uncertainty propagation was evaluated as a function of the given experimental design. A design space including the normalized maximum response range (nMRR), the data point position (DPP), the data point range (DPR) and the number of data points (NoDP) was defined. Based on ten measured ms ACE source data sets 20 specific parameter sets were selected by Design of Experiments. Monte Carlo simulations using 100 000 repeats for every parameter set were employed. The resulting measurement uncertainty propagation factors (measurement uncertainty multiplier: MUM) were used to describe the whole design space by polynomial regression. The resulting 5-dimensional response surface was investigated to evaluate the design parameter's influence and to find the minimal uncertainty propagation. It could be shown, that the nMRR is of highest importance, followed by DPP and DPR. Interestingly, the NoDP is less relevant. However, the interactions of the four parameters need to be carefully considered during design optimization. Using at least five data points which cover over 40% of the upper part of the binding hyperbola (DPP > 0.57) the MUM will be minimized (MUM approximately 1.5) when the nMRR is appropriate. It is possible to reduce the measurement uncertainty propagation more than one order of magnitude."

In this work, a self-sorting network, comprising linear hydrogen motifs, was created. Selecting six hydrogen-bonding motifs capable of both high-fidelity and promiscuous molecular recognition gave rise to a complex self-sorting system, which included motifs capable of both narcissistic and social self-sorting. Examination of the interactions between individual components, experimentally and computationally, provided a rationale for the product distribution during each phase of a cascade. This reasoning holds through up to five sequential additions of six building blocks, resulting in the construction of a biomimetic network in which the presence or absence of different components provides multiple unique pathways to distinct self-sorted configurations."

A benchmark study was carried out using QMflows, a newly developed program for automated workflows of quantum chemical calculations. In total, 24 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (1,3-DCA) reactions were benchmarked using the highly accurate G3B3 method as a reference. We screened a number of exchange and correlation functionals, including PBE, OLYP, BP86, BLYP, both with and without explicit dispersion corrections, to assess their accuracies and to determine which of these computationally efficient functionals performed the best for calculating the energetics for cycloaddition reactions. The BP86/TZ2P method produced the smallest errors for the activation and reaction enthalpies. Then, to understand the factors controlling the reactivity in these reactions, seven archetypal aza-1,3-dipolar cycloadditions were investigated using the activation strain model and energy decomposition analysis. Our investigations highlight the fact that differences in activation barrier for these 1,3-DCA reactions do not arise from differences in strain energy of the dipole, as previously proposed. Instead, relative reactivities originate from differences in interaction energy. Analysis of the 1,3-dipole\u2013dipolarophile interactions reveals the reactivity trends primarily result from differences in the extent of the primary orbital interactions."

  "description": "RNA Structure and Cellular Applications of Fluorescent Light-Up AptamersThe cellular functions of RNA are not limited to their role as blueprints for protein synthesis. In particular, noncoding RNA, such as, snRNAs, lncRNAs, miRNAs, play important roles. With increasing numbers of RNAs being identified, it is well known that the transcriptome outnumbers the proteome by far. This emphasizes the great importance of functional RNA characterization and the need to further develop tools for these investigations, many of which are still in their infancy. Fluorescent light-up aptamers (FLAPs) are RNA sequences that can bind nontoxic, cell-permeable small-molecule fluorogens and enhance their fluorescence over many orders of magnitude upon binding. FLAPs can be encoded on the DNA level using standard molecular biology tools and are subsequently transcribed into RNA by the cellular machinery, so that they can be used as fluorescent RNA tags (FLAP-tags). In this Minireview, we give a brief overview of the fluorogens that have been developed and their binding RNA aptamers, with a special focus on published crystal structures. A summary of current and future cellular FLAP applications with an emphasis on the study of RNA\u2013RNA and RNA\u2013protein interactions using split-FLAP and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) systems is given."

  "description": "Comparative genome analysis of Lactococcus lactis indicates niche adaptation and resolves genotype/phenotype disparityLactococcus lactis is one of the most important micro-organisms in the dairy industry for the fermentation of cheese and buttermilk. Besides the conversion of lactose to lactate it is responsible for product properties such as flavor and texture, which are determined by volatile metabolites, proteolytic activity and exopolysaccharide production. While the species Lactococcus lactis consists of the two subspecies lactis and cremoris their taxonomic position is confused by a group of strains that, despite of a cremoris genotype, display a lactis phenotype. Here we compared and analyzed the (draft) genomes of 43 L. lactis strains, of which 19 are of dairy and 24 are of non-dairy origin. Machine-learning algorithms facilitated the identification of orthologous groups of protein sequences (OGs) that are predictors for either the taxonomic position or the source of isolation. This allowed the unambiguous categorization of the genotype/phenotype disparity of ssp. lactis and ssp. cremoris strains. A detailed analysis of phenotypic properties including plasmid-encoded genes indicates evolutionary changes during niche adaptations. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that dairy isolates evolved from plant isolates. The analysis further suggests that genomes of cremoris phenotype strains are so eroded that they are restricted to a dairy environment. Overall the genome comparison of a diverse set of strains allowed the identification of niche and subspecies specific genes. This explains evolutionary relationships and will aid the identification and selection of industrial starter cultures."

  "description": "Phosphofructokinase controls the acetaldehyde-induced phase shift in isolated yeast glycolytic oscillatorsThe response of oscillatory systems to external perturbations is crucial for emergent properties such as synchronisation and phase locking and can be quantified in a phase response curve (PRC). In individual, oscillating yeast cells, we characterised experimentally the phase response of glycolytic oscillations for external acetaldehyde pulses and followed the transduction of the perturbation through the system. Subsequently, we analysed the control of the relevant system components in a detailed mechanistic model. The observed responses are interpreted in terms of the functional coupling and regulation in the reaction network. We find that our model quantitatively predicts the phase-dependent phase shift observed in the experimental data. The phase shift is in agreement with an adaptation leading to synchronisation with an external signal. Our model analysis establishes that phosphofructokinase plays a key role in the phase shift dynamics as shown in the PRC and adaptation time to external perturbations. Specific mechanism-based interventions, made possible through such analyses of detailed models, can improve upon standard trial and error methods, e.g. melatonin supplementation to overcome jet-lag, which are error-prone, specifically, since the effects are phase dependent and dose dependent.

DSSP, that determines secondary structures of proteins, has been updated to work well with extremely large structures in multiple formats. The PDBREPORT database that lists anomalies in protein structures has been remade to remove many small problems. These reports are now available as PDF-formatted files with a computer-readable summary. The VASE software has been added to analyze and visualize HSSP multiple sequence alignments for protein structures. The Lists collection of databases has been extended with a series of databases, most noticeably with a database that gives each protein structure a grade for usefulness in protein structure bioinformatics projects. The PDB-REDO collection of reanalyzed and re-refined protein structures that were solved by X-ray crystallography has been improved by dealing better with sugar residues and with hydrogen bonds, and adding many missing surface loops. All academic software underlying these protein structure bioinformatics applications and databases are now publicly accessible, either directly from the authors or from the GitHub software repository."

  "description": "Real-time imaging of multivesicular body\u2013plasma membrane fusion to quantify exosome release from single cellsExosomes are small extracellular vesicles with a diameter of 40\u2013150 nm, and are implicated in cellular homeostasis and cell\u2013cell communication. They can be secreted in bulk in response to cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic signals that cause multivesicular body (MVB) fusion with the plasma membrane (PM). However, research on the regulation of exosome release is hampered by the failure of current methods to capture the dynamics of exosome release. Here we describe how live imaging with tetraspanin-based pH-sensitive fluorescent reporters can quantify the MVB\u2013PM fusion rate of single cells. Our approach enables identification of exogenous stimuli, signaling pathways, and fusion complexes, and can map subcellular sites of fusion events. In addition, dual-color imaging can be used to assess simultaneous release of different cargo by MVB exocytosis. This protocol describes the complete imaging experiment, consisting of transient expression of tetraspanin reporters (2 d), live-cell (dual-color) total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (30\u201360 min per condition), and semiautomatic image analysis by using a newly developed ImageJ macro (\u00b130 min per condition)."

  "description": "Identification of mutagenic and endocrine disrupting compounds in surface water and wastewater treatment plant effluents using high-resolution effect-directed analysisEffect-directed analysis (EDA) has shown its added value for the detection and identification of compounds with varying toxicological properties in water quality research. However, for routine toxicity assessment of multiple toxicological endpoints, current EDA is considered labor intensive and time consuming. To achieve faster EDA and identification, a high-throughput (HT) EDA platform, coupling a downscaled luminescent Ames and cell-based reporter gene assays with a high-resolution fraction collector and UPLC-QTOF MS, was developed. The applicability of the HT-EDA platform in the analysis of aquatic samples was demonstrated by analysis of extracts from WWTP influent, effluent and surface water. Downscaled assays allowed detection of mutagenicity and androgen, estrogen and glucocorticoid agonism following high-resolution fractionation in 228 fractions. From 8 masses tentatively identified through non-target analysis, 2 masses were further investigated and chemically and biologically confirmed as the mutagen 1,2,3-benzotriazole and the androgen androstenedione. The compatibility of the high-throughput EDA platform with analysis of water samples and the incorporation of mutagenic and endocrine disruption endpoints allow for future application in routine monitoring in drinking water quality control and improved identification of (emerging) mutagens and endocrine disruptors."

  "description": "NIST Interlaboratory Study on Glycosylation Analysis of Monoclonal Antibodies: Comparison of Results from Diverse Analytical MethodsGlycosylation is a topic of intense current interest in the development of biopharmaceuticals because it is related to drug safety and efficacy. This work describes results of an interlaboratory study on the glycosylation of the Primary Sample (PS) of NISTmAb, a monoclonal antibody reference material. Seventy-six laboratories from industry, university, research, government, and hospital sectors in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia submitted a total of 103 reports on glycan distributions. The principal objective of this study was to report and compare results for the full range of analytical methods presently used in the glycosylation analysis of mAbs. Therefore, participation was unrestricted, with laboratories choosing their own measurement techniques. Protein glycosylation was determined in various ways, including at the level of intact mAb, protein fragments, glycopeptides, or released glycans, using a wide variety of methods for derivatization, separation, identification, and quantification. Consequently, the diversity of results was enormous, with the number of glycan compositions identified by each laboratory ranging from 4 to 48. In total, one hundred sixteen glycan compositions were reported, of which 57 compositions could be assigned consensus abundance values. These consensus medians provide community-derived values for NISTmAb PS. Agreement with the consensus medians did not depend on the specific method or laboratory type. The study provides a view of the current state-of-the-art for biologic glycosylation measurement and suggests a clear need for harmonization of glycosylation analysis methods."

In this study the \u01a9SCCPs, \u01a9MCCPs, and \u01a9LCCP concentrations are reported for South African indoor dust and pet cat hair. The median concentrations of the \u01a9CPs (C9-C37) ranged from 33 to 663\u202f\u03bcg/g for freshly collected dust (FD), 36-488\u202f\u03bcg/g for dust collected from household vacuum cleaner bags (VD), and 1.2-15\u202f\u03bcg/g for cat hair (CH) samples. MCCPs were the dominant CP group, followed by SCCPs and LCCPs. The \u01a9MCCP concentration ranged from 13 to 498\u202f\u03bcg/g in dust and 0.6-6.5\u202f\u03bcg/g in cat hair. SCCPs with shorter carbon chains and lower chlorine substitution were observed in cat hair. LCCPs with carbon chains\u202f>\u202fC20 were detected in dust and hair samples, possibly indicating the use of wax grade LCCP formulations. Non-traditional Kendrick mass defect plots were used to obtain information on the magnitude of CPs and provide evidence of possible interfering compounds. This is the first report on the occurrence of SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs in the South African indoor environment."

  "description": "Stitching the synapse: Cross-linking mass spectrometry into resolving synaptic protein interactionsSynaptic transmission is the predominant form of communication in the brain. It requires functionally specialized molecular machineries constituted by thousands of interacting synaptic proteins. Here, we made use of recent advances in cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) in combination with biochemical and computational approaches to reveal the architecture and assembly of synaptic protein complexes from mouse brain hippocampus and cerebellum. We obtained 11,999 unique lysine-lysine cross-links, comprising connections within and between 2362 proteins. This extensive collection was the basis to identify novel protein partners, to model protein conformational dynamics, and to delineate within and between protein interactions of main synaptic constituents, such as Camk2, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor, and associated proteins. Using XL-MS, we generated a protein interaction resource that we made easily accessible via a web-based platform (http://xlink.cncr.nl) to provide new entries into exploration of all protein interactions identified."

  "description": "The world is your oyster: low-dose, long-term microplastic exposure of juvenile oystersBivalve filter feeders, such as oysters, filter large volumes of water and are particularly exposed to microplastics (MP). Consequently, these animals digest and assimilate high levels of MP in their bodies that may likely impact their physiology, and potentially affect shellfish stocks, benthic habitats and, indirectly, the health status of the marine ecosystem and human consumers. In this study we exposed juvenile oysters, Crassostrea gigas, to 3 different MP concentrations (104, 105 and 106 particles L\u22121), represented by 6\u03bcm Polystyrene (PS) microbeads, compared to a control treatment receiving no MP. The study ran for a period of 80 days to test for the impacts of MP on growth, Condition Index and Lysosomal Stability. From histological analysis, microbeads were detected in the intestines of exposed oysters and in the digestive tubules, but no cellular inflammatory features were observed over time. Weight and shell length remained comparable between the different treatments and control. We found that Condition Index in the highest concentration increased initially but significantly reduced over time. The oysters in the highest MP exposure also showed the lowest mean Lysosomal Stability score throughout the experiment. Lysosomes play a vital role in the cells defense mechanisms and breakdown of constituents, crucial for the oysters\u2019 wellbeing. Most importantly, we detected an increased mortality in those oysters who were chronically exposed to the highest loads of MP."

  "description": "Fermented foods in a global age: East meets WestFermented foods and alcoholic beverages have long been an important part of the human diet in nearly every culture on every continent. These foods are often well-preserved and serve as stable and significant sources of proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Despite these common features, however, many differences exist with respect to substrates and products and the types of microbes involved in the manufacture of fermented foods and beverages produced globally. In this review, we describe these differences and consider the influence of geography and industrialization on fermented foods manufacture. Whereas fermented foods produced in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand usually depend on defined starter cultures, those made in Asia and Africa often rely on spontaneous fermentation. Likewise, in developing countries, fermented foods are not often commercially produced on an industrial scale. Although many fermented products rely on autochthonous microbes present in the raw material, for other products, the introduction of starter culture technology has led to greater consistency, safety, and quality. The diversity and function of microbes present in a wide range of fermented foods can now be examined in detail using molecular and other omic approaches. The nutritional value of fermented foods is now well-appreciated, especially in resource-poor regions where yoghurt and other fermented foods can improve public health and provide opportunities for economic development. Manufacturers of fermented foods, whether small or large, should follow Good Manufacturing Practices and have sustainable development goals. Ultimately, preferences for fermented foods and beverages depend on dietary habits of consumers, as well as regional agricultural conditions and availability of resources."

These nanocrystals adopt a A2BX6 structure (K2PtCl6 type, termed vacancy ordered perovskite) with tetrahedrally coordinated Cu(I) ions. In the structure, 25% of the A sites are occupied by [Cu4Cl]3+ clusters (75% by Cs+), and the B sites are occupied by In3+. Such a Cs3Cu4In2Cl13 compound prepared at the nanoscale is not known in the bulk and is an example of a multinary metal halide with inorganic cluster cations residing in A sites. The stability of the compound was supported by density functional theory calculations that also revealed that its bandgap is direct but parity forbidden. The existence of the Cs3Cu4In2Cl13 structure demonstrates that small inorganic cluster cations can occupy A sites in multinary metal halides."

  "description": "Aggregation induced emission of a new naphthyridine-ethynyl-gold(i) complex as a potential tool for sensing guanosine nucleotides in aqueous mediaA new organometallic alkynyl-gold(i) complex capable of exhibiting aggregation induced emission was designed and synthesized. The linear complex structure possesses a central Au(i) atom, bearing two axial ligands: (1) 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane and (2) 2-acetamido-7-ethynyl-1,8-naphthyridine. While the former accounts for its partial solubility in an aqueous environment, the latter acts as a receptor unit for binding guanosine nucleotides and derivatives via multiple hydrogen bonding interactions. At high concentrations, aggregation of the complex was observed by the formation of new absorption (\u03bbmax \u223c 400 nm) and emission bands (550-700 nm). Formation of aggregates of ca. 60 nm diameter was confirmed by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Disruption of the aggregates in the presence of guanosine derivatives resulted in a ratiometric signal with apparent association constants in the order of 105 M-1 and high sensitivity (around 63% signal change) which are, to the best of our knowledge, in line with the highest values recorded for nucleotide sensors based on hydrogen bonding and capable of working in water. Computational studies indicate the presence of additional hydrogen bonding interactions that account for the strong binding of the Au(i) complex to phosphorylated guanosine nucleotides."

  "description": "Base Metal Catalyzed Isocyanide InsertionsIsocyanides are diverse C1 building blocks considering their potential to react with nucleophiles, electrophiles, and radicals. Therefore, perhaps not surprisingly, isocyanides are highly valuable as inputs for multicomponent reactions (MCRs) and other one-pot cascade processes. In the field of organometallic chemistry, isocyanides typically serve as ligands for transition metals. The coordination of isocyanides to metal centers alters the electronic distribution of the isocyano moiety, and reaction pathways can therefore be accessed that are not possible in the absence of the metal. The tunable reactivity of the isocyanide functional group by transition metals has evolved into numerous useful applications. Especially palladium-catalyzed isocyanide insertion processes have emerged as powerful reactions in the past decade. However, reports on the use of earth-abundant and cheap base metals in these types of transformations are scarce and have received far less attention. In this Minireview, we focus on these emerging base metal catalyzed reactions and highlight their potential in synthetic organic chemistry. Although mechanistic studies are still scarce, we discuss distinct proposed catalytic cycles and categorize the literature according to 1) the (hetero)atom bound to and 2) the type of bonding with the transition metal in which the (formal) insertion occurs."

  "description": "Quantum collapse as reduction from a continuum of conditional amplitudes in an entangled state to a single actualized amplitude in the collapsed stateAccording to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics a measurement leads to the collapse of a quantum system. A unified description of a quantum system before and after measurement of the position r1a and the spin s1a of one of its electrons is proposed based on the conditional amplitude and its density. Quantum collapse is described as reduction from continuum of the conditional amplitudes {\u03c6(x2,\u22ef,xN|r1h,s1h)} in an initial quantum state to the single actualized amplitude \u03c6(x2, \u22ef,xN|r1a,s1a) in a collapsed state. The latter state contains the information about quantum entanglement, the extraction of which with fragment entanglement measure is demonstrated for the realistic valence bond models of the dissociating dihydrogen and ethylene molecules."

  "description": "Mutagenesis-Based Characterization and Improvement of a Novel Inclusion Body TagWhereas, bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) for long were regarded as undesirable aggregates emerging during recombinant protein production, they currently receive attention as promising nanoparticulate biomaterials with diverse applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. We previously identified ssTorA, a signal sequence that normally directs protein export via the Tat pathway in E. coli, as a tag that induces the accumulation of fused proteins into IBs under overexpression conditions. Here, we used targeted mutagenesis to identify features and motifs being either critical or dispensable for IB formation. We found that IB formation is neither related to the function of ssTorA as a Tat-signal sequence nor is it a general feature of this family of signal sequences. IB formation was inhibited by co-overexpression of ssTorA binding chaperones TorD and DnaK and by amino acid substitutions that affect the propensity of ssTorA to form an \u03b1-helix. Systematic deletion experiments identified a minimal region of ssTorA required for IB formation in the center of the signal sequence. Unbiased genetic screening of a library of randomly mutagenized ssTorA sequences for reduced aggregation properties allowed us to pinpoint residues that are critical to sustain insoluble expression. Together, the data point to possible mechanisms for the aggregation of ssTorA fusions. Additionally, they led to the design of a tag with superior IB-formation properties compared to the original ssTorA sequence."

  "description": "Self-Assembly of Supramolecular Polymers of N-Centered Triarylamine Trisamides in the Light of Circular Dichroism: Reaching Consensus between Electrons and NucleiThe self-assembly of chiral supramolecular polymers is an intricate process that spans a wide range of length scales. Circular dichroism techniques are ideal to study this process as they provide information on the molecular scale but are at the same time also sensitive probes of the long-range interactions that control the growth and morphology of these polymers. As yet, Electronic Circular Dichroism that uses electronic transitions as a probe has by far been the method of choice while Vibrational Circular Dichroism, which uses vibrational transitions to probe structure, is much less employed. Here, we report experimental and theoretical studies of the self-assembly of helical supramolecular polymers of (S)-triarylamine tris-amides ((S)-TATA) in which both techniques are applied in concert. Theoretical studies based on quantum chemical calculations and on simplified models that allow for extrapolation to \"infinitely\" long polymers provide a solid basis for interpreting results from each of the two techniques that on their own would appear to be contradictory. In the particular case of (S)-TATA it is shown that upon equilibration the initially formed fibers undergo a conformational transition that becomes only \"visible\" by the combination of the two techniques. Our studies thus show that combining electronic and vibrational domains offers a unique and complementary means to probe these polymers, precisely because they are sensitive to different aspects of molecular and polymeric structure."

  "description": "Antivenom neutralization of coagulopathic snake venom toxins assessed by bioactivity profiling using nanofractionation analyticsVenomous snakebite is one of the world\u2019s most lethal neglected tropical diseases. Animal-derived antivenoms are the only standardized specific therapies currently available for treating snakebite envenoming, but due to venom variation, often this treatment is not effective in counteracting all clinical symptoms caused by the multitude of injected toxins. In this study, the coagulopathic toxicities of venoms from the medically relevant snake species Bothrops asper, Calloselasma rhodostoma, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Daboia russelii, Echis carinatus and Echis ocellatus were assessed. The venoms were separated by liquid chromatography (LC) followed by nanofractionation and parallel mass spectrometry (MS). A recently developed high-throughput coagulation assay was employed to assess both the pro- and anticoagulant activity of separated venom toxins. The neutralization capacity of antivenoms on separated venom components was assessed and the coagulopathic venom peptides and enzymes that were either neutralized or remained active in the presence of antivenom were identified by correlating bioassay results with the MS data and with off-line generated proteomics data. The results showed that most snake venoms analyzed contained both procoagulants and anticoagulants. Most anticoagulants were identified as phospholipases A2s (PLA2s) and most procoagulants correlated with snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and serine proteases (SVSPs). This information can be used to better understand antivenom neutralization and can aid in the development of next-generation antivenom treatments."

  "description": "Identification of Phenylphthalazinones as a New Class of Leishmania infantum InhibitorsLeishmaniasis is a neglected parasitic disease caused by over 20 different Leishmania species. Current treatments often rely on harsh regimes of pentavalent antimonials such as sodium stibogluconate, while more recent drugs suffer other shortcomings such as low stability and rapid emergence of treatment failure, amongst others. Furthermore, the effectiveness of drugs varies depending on the infecting Leishmania species, thus there is an urgent need for new and effective anti-leishmanial drugs. Screening of an in-house compound library identified the hexahydrophthalazinone NPD-2942 as a low micromolar hit with a pIC50 of 5.8 against L. infantum and a pIC50 of 4.6 for cytotoxicity against human MRC-5 fibroblasts. To derive structure\u2013activity relationships, we modified the cyclohexyl ring of the hexahydrophthalazinone scaffold and 1,2,3-triazoles were attempted as replacement for the pyrazole ring, amongst others. Ultimately, the 2,3-pyrazole-substituted hexahydrophthalazinone NPD-1289 was identified as the most potent analogue in this series with a pIC50 of 6.3, although some cytotoxicity toward MRC-5 cells (pIC50=5.1) was recorded as well. Replacement of the unsubstituted 2,3-pyrazole with 1,2,3-triazoles led to compounds with lower anti-leishmanial activity. The current scaffold is a valuable new starting point for optimization toward novel anti-leishmanial drugs."

  "description": "Snake Venom Gland OrganoidsWnt dependency and Lgr5 expression define multiple mammalian epithelial stem cell types. Under defined growth factor conditions, such adult stem cells (ASCs) grow as 3D organoids that recapitulate essential features of the pertinent epithelium. Here, we establish long-term expanding venom gland organoids from several snake species. The newly assembled transcriptome of the Cape coral snake reveals that organoids express high levels of toxin transcripts. Single-cell RNA sequencing of both organoids and primary tissue identifies distinct venom-expressing cell types as well as proliferative cells expressing homologs of known mammalian stem cell markers. A hard-wired regional heterogeneity in the expression of individual venom components is maintained in organoid cultures. Harvested venom peptides reflect crude venom composition and display biological activity. This study extends organoid technology to reptilian tissues and describes an experimentally tractable model system representing the snake venom gland."

  "description": "GUI Implementation of VCDtools, A Program to Analyze Computed Vibrational Circular Dichroism SpectraAs computing power increases, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) calculations on molecules of larger sizes and complexities become possible. At the same time, the spectra resulting from these computations become increasingly more cumbersome to analyze. Here, we describe the GUI implementation into the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) software package of VCDtools, a toolbox that provides a user-friendly means to analyze VCD spectra. Key features are the use of the generalized coupled oscillator analysis methods, as well as an easy visualization of the atomic electric and magnetic transition dipole moments which together provide detailed insight in the origin of the VCD intensity. Using several prototypical examples we demonstrate the functionalities of the program. In particular, we show how the spectra can be analyzed to detect differences between theory and experiment arising from large-amplitude motions or incorrect molecular structures and, most importantly, how the program can be used to prevent incorrect enantiomeric assignments."

  "description": "Science-based entrepreneurship education as a means for university-industry technology transferThis paper explores the potential of university-industry technology transfer through science-based entrepreneurship education (SBEE). The scientific literature focuses mostly on enabling university-industry technology transfer via university-industry collaboration in research, and not so much in (science) education. The paper identifies four strands of relevant literature for further theorizing SBEE principles to research its contribution to industry-technology transfer: 1. Embedding entrepreneurship education in universities; 2. Balancing theory and practice of entrepreneurship education; 3. Cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset through entrepreneurship education; and 4. Creating spin-offs through entrepreneurship education. One of the main theoretical contributions of this paper is, that SBEE is different from regular entrepreneurship education in its need for being firmly embedded in a science, technology and R&D environment, both within and outside the university. This is important in order to give SBEE students the opportunity to gain experience with handling the hurdles for successful university-industry technology transfer. The main empirical finding is that elements in the program, related to for example the balance between teaching entrepreneurship through theory and experiential learning, are not systematically covered. It means that fundamental questions such as: Can entrepreneurship be indeed taught? Which elements of entrepreneurship can be taught through theory, and which ones must be experienced in practice? are currently left unanswered. Systematic coverage of these questions enables a better exploitation of the possibilities that SBEE offers for university-industry technology transfer."

  "description": "Transthyretin-binding activity of complex mixtures representing the composition of thyroid-hormone disrupting contaminants in house dust and human serumBACKGROUND: House dust contains many organic contaminants that can compete with the thyroid hormone (TH) thyroxine (T4) for binding to trans-thyretin (TTR). How these contaminants work together at levels found in humans and how displacement from TTR in vitro relates to in vivo T4-TTR binding is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to determine the TTR-binding potency for contaminant mixtures as found in house dust, maternal serum, and infant se-rum; to study whether the TTR-binding potency of the mixtures follows the principle of concentration addition; and to extrapolate the in vitro TTR-binding potency to in vivo inhibition levels of T4-TTR binding in maternal and infant serum. METHODS: Twenty-five contaminants were tested for their in vitro capacity to compete for TTR-binding with a fluorescent FITC-T4 probe. Three mixtures were reconstituted proportionally to median concentrations for these chemicals in house dust, maternal serum, or infant serum from Nordic countries. Measured concentration\u2013response curves were compared with concentration\u2013response curves predicted by concentration addition. For each reconstituted serum mixture, its inhibitor\u2013TTR dissociation constant (Ki) was used to estimate inhibition levels of T4-TTR binding in human blood. RESULTS: The TTR-binding potency of the mixtures was well predicted by concentration addition. The \u223c 20% inhibition in FITC-T4 binding observed for the mixtures reflecting median concentrations in maternal and infant serum was extrapolated to 1.3% inhibition of T4-TTR binding in maternal and 1.5% in infant blood. For nontested mixtures reflecting high-end serum concentrations, these estimates were 6.2% and 4.9%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The relatively low estimated inhibition levels at median exposure levels may explain why no relationship between exposure to TTR-binding compounds and circulating T4 levels in humans has been reported, so far. We hypothesize, however, that 1.3% inhibition of T4-TTR binding may ultimately be decisive for reaching a status of maternal hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia associated with impaired neurodevelopment in children."

To address this question, the dairy-origin lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilusand Leuconostoc mesenteroides, commonly used in cheese starter cultures, were grown in pure and four different co-cultures. We used a dynamic metabolic modelling approach based on the integration of the genome-scale metabolic networks of the involved organisms to simulate the co-cultures. The strain-specific kinetic parameters of dynamic models were estimated using the pure culture experimentsand they were subsequently applied to co-culture models. Biomass, carbon source, lactic acid and most of the amino acid concentration profiles simulated by the co-culture models fit closely to the experimental resultsand the co-culture models explained the mechanisms behind the dynamic microbial abundance. We then applied the co-culture models to estimate further information on the co-cultures that could not be obtained by the experimental method used. This includes estimation of the profile of various metabolites in the co-culture medium such as flavour compounds producedand the individual organism level metabolic exchange flux profiles, which revealed the potential metabolic interactions between organisms in the co-cultures."

The use of RBT protocols often results in large variations of test results that may lead to wrong interpretations. The present study aims to obtain a fundamental understanding of this variability. For this, we subjected the compounds 4-chloroaniline (4CA), carbamazepine (CBZ), metformin (MET), and N-methylpiperazine (NMP) to a variety of different test conditions. Inocula from five local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were used in an attempt to enhance the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 310 biodegradability tests. The biodegradation capacity in RBTs, community composition and adaptation of the communities were compared after one week of pre-exposure in batch and four months exposure in chemostat. The results confirm that none of the test compounds is readily biodegradable in the standard OECD 310 RBT. However, when pre-exposure under either batch or chemostat conditions was included, 4CA was degraded in some cases and less variability among different inocula was observed for the transformation of MET. Bacterial communities from the five locations were found to be significantly different in composition from one another. In addition, pre-treatment performed before the RBT significantly changed the composition of each community. Results of this experiment show that short-term pre-exposure may increase the absolute number of degraders and deserves to be further investigated as a potential method to reduce the outcome variability of RBTs."

  "description": "Past, present, and future developments in enantioselective analysis using capillary electromigration techniquesEnantioseparation of chiral products has become increasingly important in a large diversity of academic and industrial applications. The separation of chiral compounds is inherently challenging and thus requires a suitable analytical technique that can achieve high resolution and sensitivity. In this context, CE has shown remarkable results so far. Chiral CE offers an orthogonal enantioselectivity and is typically considered less costly than chromatographic techniques, since only minute amounts of chiral selectors are needed. Several CE approaches have been developed for chiral analysis, including chiral EKC and chiral CEC. Enantioseparations by EKC benefit from the wide variety of possible pseudostationary phases that can be employed. Chiral CEC, on the other hand, combines chromatographic separation principles with the bulk fluid movement of CE, benefitting from reduced band broadening as compared to pressure-driven systems. Although UV detection is conventionally used for these approaches, MS can also be considered. CE-MS represents a promising alternative due to the increased sensitivity and selectivity, enabling the chiral analysis of complex samples. The potential contamination of the MS ion source in EKC-MS can be overcome using partial-filling and counter-migration techniques. However, chiral analysis using monolithic and open-tubular CEC-MS awaits additional method validation and a dedicated commercial interface. Further efforts in chiral CE are expected toward the improvement of existing techniques, the development of novel pseudostationary phases, and establishing the use of chiral ionic liquids, molecular imprinted polymers, and metal-organic frameworks. These developments will certainly foster the adoption of CE(-MS) as a well-established technique in routine chiral analysis."

  "description": "Receptor-based in vitro activities to assess human exposure to chemical mixtures and related health impactsHumans are exposed to a large number of chemicals from sources such as the environment, food, and consumer products. There is growing concern that human exposure to chemical mixtures, especially during critical periods of development, increases the risk of adverse health effects in newborns or later in life. Historically, the one-chemical-at-a-time approach has been applied both for exposure assessment and hazard characterisation, leading to insufficient knowledge about human health effects caused by exposure to mixtures of chemicals that have the same target. To circumvent this challenge researchers can apply in vitro assays to analyse both exposure to and human health effects of chemical mixtures in biological samples. The advantages of using in vitro assays are: (i) that an integrated effect is measured, taking combined mixture effects into account and (ii) that in vitro assays can reduce complexity in identification of Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) in human tissues. We have reviewed the state-of-the-art on the use of receptor-based in vitro assays to assess human exposure to chemical mixtures and related health impacts. A total of 43 studies were identified, in which endpoints for the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the androgen receptor (AR) were used. The majority of studies reported biological activities that could be associated with breast cancer incidence, male reproductive health effects, developmental toxicities, human demographic characteristics or lifestyle factors such as dietary patterns. A few studies used the bioactivities to check the coverage of the chemical analyses of the human samples, whereas in vitro assays have so far not regularly been used for identifying CECs in human samples, but rather in environmental matrices or food packaging materials. A huge field of novel applications using receptor-based in vitro assays for mixture toxicity assessment on human samples and effect-directed analysis (EDA) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for identification of toxic compounds waits for exploration. In the future this could lead to a paradigm shift in the way we unravel adverse human health effects caused by chemical mixtures."

  "description": "Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation to probe the dynamic association equilibria of \u03b2-D-galactosidaseProtein dynamics play a significant role in many aspects of enzyme activity. Monitoring of structural changes and aggregation of biotechnological enzymes under native conditions is important to safeguard their properties and function. In this work, the potential of asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) to study the dynamic association equilibria of the enzyme \u03b2-D-galactosidase (\u03b2-D-Gal) was evaluated. Three commercial products of \u03b2-D-Gal were investigated using carrier liquids containing sodium chloride or ammonium acetate, and the effect of adding magnesium (II) chloride to the carrier liquid was assessed. Preservation of protein structural integrity during AF4 analysis was essential and the influence of several parameters, such as the focusing step (including use of frit-inlet), cross flow, and injected amount, was studied. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to corroborate the in-solution enzyme oligomerization observed with AF4. In contrast to SEC, AF4 provided sufficiently mild separation conditions to monitor protein conformations without disturbing the dynamic association equilibria. AF4 analysis showed that ammonium acetate concentrations above 40 mM led to further association of the dimers (\u201ctetramerization\u201d) of \u03b2-D-Gal. Magnesium ions, which are needed to activate \u03b2-D-Gal, appeared to induce dimer association, raising justifiable questions about the role of divalent metal ions in protein oligomerization and on whether tetramers or dimers are the most active form of \u03b2-D-Gal."

A time-course bioassay based on high density well-plates was performed in parallel with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), providing a straightforward and rapid procedure to simultaneously obtain chemical and biological information of active compounds. Through multiple nanofractionations into the same well-plate and comparisons of the orthogonal separation results of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors can be accurately identified from co-eluates. The screening platform was comprehensively evaluated and validated, and was applied to the screenings of green tea polyphenols and Ginkgo folium flavonoids. After accurate peak shape and retention time matching between the bioactivity chromatograms and MS chromatograms, ten \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors were successfully screened out and identified. The proposed screening method is rapid, effective and can avoid ignoring low abundant/active inhibitors."

  "description": "Reducing the influence of geometry-induced gradient deformation in liquid chromatographic retention modellingRapid optimization of gradient liquid chromatographic (LC) separations often utilizes analyte retention modelling to predict retention times as function of eluent composition. However, due to the dwell volume and technical imperfections, the actual gradient may deviate from the set gradient in a fashion unique to the employed instrument. This makes accurate retention modelling for gradient LC challenging, in particular when very fast separations are pursued. Although gradient deformation has been addressed in method-transfer situations, it is rarely taken into account when reporting analyte retention parameters obtained from gradient LC data, hampering the comparison of data from various sources. In this study, a response-function-based algorithm was developed to determine analyte retention parameters corrected for geometry-induced deformations by specific LC instruments. Out of a number of mathematical distributions investigated as response-functions, the so-called \u201cstable function\u201d was found to describe the formed gradient most accurately. The four parameters describing the model resemble the statistical moments of the distribution and are related to chromatographic parameters, such as dwell volume and flow rate. The instrument-specific response function can then be used to predict the actual shape of any other gradient programmed on that instrument. To incorporate the predicted gradient in the retention modelling of the analytes, the model was extended to facilitate an unlimited number of linear gradient steps to solve the equations numerically. The significance and impact of distinct gradient deformation for fast gradients was demonstrated using three different LC instruments. As a proof of principle, the algorithm and retention parameters obtained on a specific instrument were used to predict the retention times on different instruments. The relative error in the predicted retention times went down from an average of 9.8% and 12.2% on the two other instruments when using only a dwell-volume correction to 2.1% and 6.5%, respectively, when using the proposed algorithm. The corrected retention parameters are less dependent on geometry-induced instrument effects."

  "description": "Lack of Cooperativity in the Triangular X3Halogen-Bonded Synthon?We have investigated 44 crystal structures, found in the Cambridge Structural Database, containing the X3 synthon (where X = Cl, Br, I) in order to verify whether three type II halogen-halogen contacts forming the synthon exhibit cooperativity. A hypothesis that this triangular halogen-bonded motif is stabilized by cooperative effects is postulated on the basis of structural data. However, theoretical investigations of simplified model systems in which the X3 motif is present demonstrate that weak synergy occurs only in the case of the I3 motif. In the present paper we computationally investigate crystal structures in which the X3 synthon is present, including halomesitylene structures, that are usually described as being additionally stabilized by a synergic interaction. Our computations find no cooperativity for halomesitylene trimers containing the X3 motif. Only in the case of two other structures containing the I3 synthon a very weak or weak synergy, i.e. the cooperative effect being stronger than -0.40 kcal mol-1, is found. The crystal structure of iodoform has the most pronounced cooperativity of all investigated systems, amounting to about 10% of the total interaction energy. "

Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis contributes to the pathogenesis are complex and not fully understood. To dissect the role of this axis in cancer, we discuss its ability to impinge on canonical and less conventional signaling networks in different cancer cell types; its bidirectional crosstalk, notably with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and other factors present in the TME; and the infiltration of immune cells that supporttumor progression. We discuss current and emerging avenues that target the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis. Coordinately targeting both RTKs and CXCR4/ACKR3 and/or CXCL12 is an attractive approach to consider in multitargeted cancer therapies. In addition, inhibiting infiltrating immune cells or reactivating the immune system along with modulating the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in the TME has therapeutic promise. "

  "description": "Influence maximization in the presence of vulnerable nodes: A ratio perspectiveInfluence maximization is a key problem seeking to identify users who will diffuse information to influence the largest number of other users in a social network. A drawback of the influence maximization problem is that it could be socially irresponsible to influence users many of whom would be harmed, due to their demographics, health conditions, or socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., predominantly overweight people influenced to buy junk food). Motivated by this drawback and by the fact that some of these vulnerable users will be influenced inadvertently, we introduce the problem of finding a set of users (seeds) that limits the influence to vulnerable users while maximizing the influence to the non-vulnerable users. We define a measure that captures the quality of a set of seeds as an additively smoothed ratio (ASR) between the expected number of influenced non-vulnerable users and the expected number of influenced vulnerable users. Then, we develop methods which aim to find a set of seeds that maximizes the measure: greedy heuristics, an approximation algorithm, as well as several variations of the approximation algorithm. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate they substantially outperform a state-of-the-art competitor in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. We also demonstrate that the variations of our approximation algorithm offer different trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency."

Their comprehensive experimental characterization is generally not feasible, particularly for unculturable organisms. In principle, the full range of metabolic capabilities can be computed from an organism's annotated genome using metabolic network reconstruction. However, current computational methods cannot deal with genome-scale metabolic networks. Part of the problem is that these methods aim to enumerate all metabolic pathways, while computation of all (elementally balanced) conversions between nutrients and products would suffice. Indeed, the elementary conversion modes (ECMs, defined by Urbanczik and Wagner) capture the full metabolic capabilities of a network, but the use of ECMs has not been accessible until now. We explain and extend the theory of ECMs, implement their enumeration in ecmtool, and illustrate their applicability. This work contributes to the elucidation of the full metabolic footprint of any cell."

The CsPbBr3-Pb4S3Br2 nanocrystals are prepared by a two-step direct synthesis using preformed subnanometer CsPbBr3 clusters. Density functional theory calculations indicate the creation of a quasi-type II alignment at the heterointerface as well as the formation of localized trap states, promoting ultrafast separation of photogenerated excitons and carrier trapping, as confirmed by spectroscopic experiments.

An increased structural rigidity is conferred to the perovskite lattice when it is interfaced with the chalcohalide lattice.

  "description": "Different resource allocation in a Bacillus subtilis population displaying bimodal motilityTo cope with sudden changes in their environment, bacteria can use a bet-hedging strategy by dividing the population into cells with different properties. This so-called bimodal or bistable cellular differentiation is generally controlled by positive feedback regulation of transcriptional activators. Due to the continuous increase in cell volume, it is difficult for these activators to reach an activation threshold concentration when cells are growing exponentially. This is one reason why bimodal differentiation is primarily observed from the onset of the stationary phase when exponential growth ceases. An exception is the bimodal induction of motility in Bacillus subtilis, which occurs early during exponential growth. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain this, including double negative-feedback regulation and the stability of the mRNA molecules involved. In this study, we used fluorescence-assisted cell sorting to compare the transcriptome of motile and non-motile cells and noted that expression of ribosomal genes is lower in motile cells. This was confirmed using an unstable GFP reporter fused to the strong ribosomal rpsD promoter. We propose that the reduction in ribosomal gene expression in motile cells is the result of a diversion of cellular resources to the synthesis of the chemotaxis and motility systems. In agreement, single-cell microscopic analysis showed that motile cells are slightly shorter than non-motile cells, an indication of slower growth. We speculate that this growth rate reduction can contribute to the bimodal induction of motility during exponential growth."

The complete Gibbs free energy profiles for the oxidation of secondary hydroxy groups at C2, C3, and C4 were computed for methyl \u03b2-glucoside and methyl carba-\u03b2-glucoside. Both computations and oxidation experiments on carba-glucosides demonstrate the crucial role of the ring oxygen in the C3 regioselectivity observed during the oxidation of glucosides. Analysis of the model systems for oxidized methyl \u03b2-glucoside shows that the C3 oxidation product is intrinsically favored in the presence of the ring oxygen. Subsequent energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and Hirschfeld charge analysis reveal the role of the ring oxygen: it positively polarizes C1/C5 by inductive effects and disfavors any subsequent buildup of positive charge at neighboring carbon atoms, rendering C3 the most favored site for the \u03b2-hydride elimination."

  "description": "Acylation of arginine in goserelin-loaded PLGA microspheresAcylation of peptides is a well-known but unwanted phenomenon in polyester matrices such as poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres used as controlled release formulations. Acylation normally occurs on lysine residues and the N-terminus of the peptide. The purpose of the present work was to assess other possible acylation sites on peptides. Goserelin was used as a model peptide that lacks lysine and a free N-terminus, but contains other nucleophilic residues, i.e. serine, tyrosine and arginine, which potentially can be acylated. Goserelin loaded PLGA microspheres were prepared by a double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. Liquid chromatography ion-trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS) was used for determining and monitoring acylation of released goserelin. It is demonstrated that arginine is subjected to acylation with glycolic acid and lactic acid units of PLGA, which was followed by loss of NH3 from the guanidine group to obtain 2-oxazolin-4-one and 5-methyl-2-oxazolin-4-one residues with masses that are 41 and 55 Da higher, respectively, than the native goserelin. There was no evidence for acylation of serine and tyrosine in goserelin. Our results demonstrate that beside lysine also acylation of arginine can occur in peptides and proteins that are loaded and released from PLGA matrixes."

  "description": "From the exposome to mechanistic understanding of chemical-induced adverse effectsThe exposome encompasses an individual's exposure to exogenous chemicals, as well as endogenous chemicals that are produced or altered in response to external stressors. While the exposome concept has been established for human health, its principles can be extended to include broader ecological issues. The assessment of exposure is tightly interlinked with hazard assessment. Here, we explore if mechanistic understanding of the causal links between exposure and adverse effects on human health and the environment can be improved by integrating the exposome approach with the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept that structures and organizes the sequence of biological events from an initial molecular interaction of a chemical with a biological target to an adverse outcome. Complementing exposome research with the AOP concept may facilitate a mechanistic understanding of stress-induced adverse effects, examine the relative contributions from various components of the exposome, determine the primary risk drivers in complex mixtures, and promote an integrative assessment of chemical risks for both human and environmental health."

  "description": "Quantum-Confined and Enhanced Optical Absorption of Colloidal PbS Quantum Dots at Wavelengths with Expected Bulk BehaviorNowadays it is well-accepted to attribute bulk-like optical absorption properties to colloidal PbS quantum dots (QDs) at wavelengths above 400 nm. This assumption permits to describe PbS QD light absorption by using bulk optical constants and to determine QD concentration in colloidal solutions from simple spectrophotometric measurements. Here we demonstrate that PbS QDs experience the quantum confinement regime across the entire near UV-vis-NIR spectral range, therefore also between 350 and 400 nm already proposed to be sufficiently far above the band gap to suppress quantum confinement. This effect is particularly relevant for small PbS QDs (with diameter of \u22644 nm) leading to absorption coefficients that largely differ from bulk values (up to \u223c40% less). As a result of the broadband quantum confinement and of the high surface-to-volume ratio peculiar of nanocrystals, suitable surface chemical modification of PbS QDs is exploited to achieve a marked, size-dependent enhancement of the absorption coefficients compared to bulk values (up to \u223c250%). We provide empirical relations to determine the absorption coefficients at 400 nm of as-synthesized and ligand-exchanged PbS QDs, accounting for the broadband quantum confinement and suggesting a heuristic approach to qualitatively predict the ligand effects on the optical absorption properties of PbS QDs. Our findings go beyond formalisms derived from Maxwell Garnett effective medium theory to describe QD optical properties and permit to spectrophotometrically calculate the concentration of PbS QD solutions avoiding underestimation due to deviations from the bulk. In perspective, we envisage the use of extended \u03c0-conjugated ligands bearing electronically active substituents to enhance light-harvesting in QD solids and suggest the inadequacy of the representation of ligands at the QD surface as mere electric dipoles."

  "description": "Binding and Packing in Two-Component Colloidal Quantum Dot Ligand Shells: Linear Versus Branched CarboxylatesIn this work, we present a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of two-component ligand shells passivating CdSe quantum dots. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we first show that exposing oleate capped quantum dots to primary carboxylic acids results in a one-for-one exchange that preserves the overall ligand surface concentration. Exposure to straight-chain acids leads to a binary ligand shell that behaves as an ideal mixture and that has a composition matching the overall acid composition of the dispersion. In the case of branched-chain acids, the exchange is restricted to about 25% of the original ligands. Based on molecular dynamics simulations, we argue that this behavior reflects the more favorable packing of oleates compared to branched carboxylates on the (100) facets of CdSe quantum dots."

  "description": "Determination of monoamine neurotransmitters in zebrafish (Danio rerio) by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry with a two-step derivatizationA sensitive analytical method for the determination of monoamine neurotransmitters (MNTs) in zebrafish larvae was developed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Six MNTs were selected as target compounds for neurotoxicity testing. MNTs underwent a two-step derivatization with hexamethyldisilazane (HDMS) for O-silylation followed by N-methyl-bis-heptafluorobutyramide (MBHFBA) for N-perfluoroacylation. Derivatization conditions were optimized by an experimental design approach. Method validation showed linear calibration curves (r 2\u2009>\u20090.9976) in the range of 1\u2013100 ng for all the compounds. The recovery rates were between 92 and 119%. The method was repeatable and reproducible with relative standard deviations (RSD) in the range of 2.5\u20139.3% for intra-day and 4.8\u201312% for inter-day variation. The limits of detection and the limits of quantitation were 0.4\u20130.8 and 1.2\u20132.7 ng/mL, respectively. The method was successfully applied to detect and quantify trace levels of MNTs in 5-day-old zebrafish larvae that were exposed to low concentrations of neurotoxic chemicals such as pesticides and methylmercury. Although visual malformations were not detected, the MNT levels varied significantly during early zebrafish development. These results show that exposure to neurotoxic chemicals can alter neurotransmitter levels and thereby may influence early brain development."

  "description": "Identification of a substrate domain that determines system specificity in mycobacterial type VII secretion systemsType VII secretion (T7S) systems are specialized machineries used by mycobacterial pathogens to transport important virulence factors across their highly hydrophobic cell envelope. There are up to five mycobacterial T7S systems, named ESX-1 to ESX-5, at least three of which specifically secrete a different subset of substrates. The T7S substrates or substrate complexes are defined by the general secretion motif YxxxD/E. However this motif does not determine system specificity. Here, we show that the substrate domain recognized by the EspG chaperone is the determinant factor for this specificity. We first show that the introduction of point mutations into the EspG 1 -binding domain of the ESX-1 substrate pair PE35/PPE68-1 affects their secretion. Subsequently, we demonstrate that replacing this domain by the EspG 5 -binding domain of the ESX-5 substrate PPE18 resulted in EspG 5 dependence and exclusive rerouting to the ESX-5 system. This rerouting of PE35/PPE68-1 to the ESX-5 system had a negative effect on the secretion of endogenous ESX-5 substrates."

Addressing these limitations, we report a proximity-induced labeling system which applies a moderate affinity peptide ligand. The design process was structure-guided and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. We show that selective protein labeling can be performed inside living cells enabling the subcellular translocation of a protein via ligand-directed chemistry for the first time."

Without using an analytical column the cleaned extracts were directly injected into the qTOF-HRMS followed by quantification of the CPs by a mathematical algorithm. The recoveries of the four SCCP, MCCP and LCCP-spiked sewage sludge samples ranged from 86 to 123%. This APCI-qTOF-HRMS method is a fast and promising technique for routinely measuring SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs in sewage sludge. Australian sewage sludge was dominated by MCCPs with concentrations ranging from 542 to 3645 ng/g dry weight (dw). Lower SCCPs concentrations (<57-1421 ng/g dw) were detected in the Australian sewage sludge, which were comparable with the LCCPs concentrations (116-960 ng/g dw). This is the first time that CPs were reported in Australian sewage sludge. The results of this study gives a first impression on the distribution of the SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs in Australia wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)."

  "description": "Independent assessment of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) sample preparation quality: Effect of sample preparation on MALDI-MS of synthetic polymersRationale: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) provides detailed and in-depth information about the molecular characteristics of synthetic polymers. To obtain the most accurate results the sample preparation parameters should be chosen to suit the sample and the aim of the experiment. Because the underlying principles of MALDI are still not fully known, a priori determination of optimal sample preparation protocols is often not possible. Methods: Employing an automated sample preparation quality assessment method recently presented by us we quantified the sample preparation quality obtained using various sample preparation protocols. Six conventional matrices with and without added potassium as a cationization agent and six ionic liquid matrices (ILMs) were assessed using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as samples. All sample preparation protocols were scored and ranked based on predefined quality parameters and spot-to-spot repeatability. Results: Clearly distinctive preferences were observed in matrix identity and cationization agent for PEG, PTHF and PMMA, as the addition of an excess of potassium cationization agent results in an increased score for PMMA and a contrasting matrix-dependent effect for PTHF and PEG. The addition of excess cationization agent to sample mixtures dissipates any overrepresentation of high molecular weight polymer species. Our results show reduced ionization efficiency and similar sample deposit homogeneity for all tested ILMs, compared with well-performing conventional MALDI matrices. Conclusions: The results published here represent a start in the unsupervised quantification of sample preparation quality for MALDI samples. This method can select the best sample preparation parameters for any synthetic polymer sample and the results can be used to formulate hypotheses on MALDI principles."

  "description": "Development of a luminescent mutagenicity test for high-throughput screening of aquatic samplesThe Salmonella reversion based Ames test is the most widely used method for mutagenicity testing. For rapid toxicity assessment of e.g. water samples and for effect-directed analysis, however, the Ames test suffers from lack of throughput and is regarded as a laborious, time consuming method. To achieve faster analysis, with increased throughput, a (downscaled) luminescent derivative of the Ames Salmonella/microsome fluctuation test has been developed through expression of the Photorhabdus luminescens luciferase in the Salmonella TA98 and TA100 strains. The applicability of this test is demonstrated by analysis of environmentally relevant compounds, a suspended particulate matter extract and an industrial effluent sample. Use of the luminescent reporter reduced the required detection time from 48 to 28 h with a specificity of 84% for responses reported in the literature to a set of 14 mutagens as compared to 72% in the unmodified fluctuation test. Testing of the same compounds in a downscaled luminescent format resulted in an 88% similarity with the response found in the regular luminescent format. The increase in throughput, faster analysis and potential for real-time bacterial quantification that luminescence provides, allows future application in the high-throughput screening of large numbers of samples or sample fractions, as required in effect-directed analysis in order to accelerate the identification of (novel) mutagens."

Development of less costly and less technically challenging remediation methods are needed; therefore, we developed a formulation based on micronized vermiculite that, when air-dried, resulted in a granular product containing the 4-chlorophenol (4-CP)-degrading Gram-positive bacterium Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6. This formulation and stabilization method yielded survival rates of about 60% that remained stable in storage for at least 3months at 4\u00b0C. The 4-CP degradation by the formulated and desiccated A. chlorophenolicus A6 cells was compared to that of freshly grown cells in controlled-environment soil microcosms. The stabilized cells degraded 4-CP equally efficient as freshly grown cells in two different set-ups using both hygienized and non-treated soils. The desiccated microbial product was successfully employed in an outdoor pot trial showing its effectiveness under more realistic environmental conditions. No significant phytoremediation effects on 4-CP degradation were observed in the outdoor pot experiment. The 4-CP degradation kinetics from both the microcosms and the outdoor pot trial were used to generate a predictive model of 4-CP biodegradation potentially useful for larger-scale operations, enabling better bioremediation set-ups and saving of resources. This study also opens up the possibility of formulating and stabilizing also other Arthrobacter strains possessing different desirable pollutant-degrading capabilities."

  "description": "Mutations in ppe38 block PE_PGRS secretion and increase virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosisMycobacterium tuberculosis requires a large number of secreted and exported proteins for its virulence, immune modulation and nutrient uptake. Most of these proteins are transported by the different type\u2009VII secretion systems1,2. The most recently evolved type\u2009VII secretion system, ESX-5, secretes dozens of substrates belonging to the PE and PPE families, which are named for conserved proline and glutamic acid residues close to the amino\u2009terminus3,4. However, the role of these proteins remains largely elusive 1 . Here, we show that mutations of ppe38 completely block the secretion of two large subsets of ESX-5 substrates, that is, PPE-MPTR and PE_PGRS, together comprising >80 proteins. Importantly, hypervirulent clinical M.\u2009tuberculosis strains of the Beijing lineage have such a mutation and a concomitant loss of secretion 5 . Restoration of PPE38-dependent secretion partially reverted the hypervirulence phenotype of a Beijing strain, and deletion of ppe38 in moderately virulent M.\u2009tuberculosis increased virulence. This indicates that these ESX-5 substrates have an important role in virulence attenuation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that deletion of ppe38 occurred at the branching point of the 'modern' Beijing sublineage and is shared by Beijing outbreak strains worldwide, suggesting that this deletion may have contributed to their success and global distribution6,7."

  "description": "Oligonucleotides with Cationic Backbone and Their Hybridization with DNA: Interplay of Base Pairing and Electrostatic AttractionNon-natural oligonucleotides represent important (bio)chemical tools and potential therapeutic agents. Backbone modifications altering hybridization properties and biostability can provide useful analogues. Here, we employ an artificial nucleosyl amino acid (NAA) motif for the synthesis of oligonucleotides containing a backbone decorated with primary amines. An oligo-T sequence of this cationic DNA analogue shows significantly increased affinity for complementary DNA. Notably, hybridization with DNA is still governed by Watson\u2013Crick base pairing. However, single base pair mismatches are tolerated and some degree of sequence-independent interactions between the cationic NAA backbone and fully mismatched DNA are observed. These findings demonstrate that a high density of positive charges directly connected to the oligonucleotide backbone can affect Watson\u2013Crick base pairing. This provides a paradigm for the design of therapeutic oligonucleotides with altered backbone charge patterns."

Lake, river and groundwater were sampled from the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment over four seasons and the downstream Jukskei River was monitored during the winter season. Triazine herbicide concentrations in the Hartbeespoort Dam were in the order atrazine > simazine > propazine > ametryn > prometryn throughout the four seasons sampled. Triazine herbicide concentrations in the Hartbeespoort Dam surface water were highest in summer and gradually decreased in successive seasons of autumn, winter and spring. Terbuthylazine was the only triazine herbicide detected at all sampling sites in the Jukskei River, though atrazine recorded much higher concentrations for the N14 and Kyalami sites, with concentrations of 923 and 210 ng L\u2212 1 respectively, compared to 134 and 74 ng L\u2212 1 for terbuthylazine. Analytical results in conjunction with river flow data indicate that the Jukskei and Crocodile Rivers contribute the greatest triazine herbicide loads into the Hartbeespoort Dam. No triazine herbicides were detected in the fish muscle tested, showing that bioaccumulation of triazine herbicides is negligible. Atrazine and terbuthylazine metabolites were detected in the fish muscle with deethylatrazine (DEA) being detected in both catfish and carp muscle at low concentrations of 0.2 and 0.3 ng g\u2212 1, respectively. Desethylterbuthylazine (DET) was detected only in catfish at a concentration of 0.3 ng g\u2212 1. With atrazine herbicide groundwater concentrations being > 130 ng L\u2212 1 for all seasons and groundwater \u2211 triazine herbicide concentrations ranging between 527 and 367 ng L\u2212 1, triazine compounds in the Hartbeespoort Dam catchment may pose a risk to humans and wildlife in light findings of endocrine and immune disrupting atrazine effects by various researchers."

Synthesis, in vitro and in vivo characterization of 5-substituted-2-thiazol-4-n-propylpiperazinesH3 receptors present on histaminergic and non-histaminergic neurons, act as autoreceptors or heteroreceptors controlling neurotransmitter release and synthesis. Previous, studies have found that the compound N-methyl-N-3-phenylalkyl-2-[2-(4-n-propylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3-thiazol-5-yl]ethan-1 -amine (ADS-531, 2c) exhibits high in vitro potency toward H3 Guinea pig jejunal receptors, with pA2 = 8.27. To optimize the structure of the lead compound ADS-531, a series of 5-substituted-2-thiazol-4-n-propylpiperazines 3 were synthesized and subjected to in vitro pharmacological characterization; the alkyl chain between position 2 of the thiazole ring and the terminal secondary N-methylamino function was elongated from three to four methylene groups and the N-methylamino functionality was substituted by benzyl-, 2-phenylethyl-, and 3-phenyl-propyl- moieties. SAR studies on novel non-imidazole, 5-substituted-2-thiazol-4-n-propyl-piperazines 3 showed that the most active compound 3a (pA2 = 8.38), additionally possessed a weak competitive H1-antagonistic activity. Therefore, compound ADS-531, which did not exhibit any H1-antagonistic activity, was chosen for further evaluation for its affinity to the recombinant rat and human histamine H3 receptors (rH3R and hH3R, respectively). ADS-531 exhibited nanomolar affinity for both rH3R and hH3R receptors. It was also shown that, ADS-531 given subchronically to rats (s.c. 3 mg/kg, 5 days) penetrated the brain, where it affected dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin concentration; however, it did not affect histamine concentration nor feeding behavior."

A detailed analysis carried out by NMR studies performed in different DMSO/deuterated H2O mixtures indicates the presence of two different assembly modes in the aggregates: (i) chain assemblies, which are based mainly on aurophilic interactions, and (ii) stacked assemblies, which are based on Au\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 and \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions. These different supramolecular environments can also be detected by their intrinsic optical properties (differences in absorption and emission spectra) and are predicted by the changes in the relative binding energy from density functional theory calculations carried out in DMSO and H2O. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments performed in the same mixture of solvents are in agreement with the formation of aggregates in all cases. The aromatic units chosen, bipyridine and terpyridine, allow the use of external stimuli to reversibly change the aggregation state of the supramolecular assemblies. Interaction with the Zn2+ cation is observed to disassemble the aggregates, while encapsulating agents competing for Zn2+ complexation revert the process to the aggregation stage, as verified by SAXS and NMR. The adaptive nature of the supramolecular assemblies to the metal-ion content is accompanied by significant changes in the absorption and emission spectra, signaling the aggregation state and also the content on Zn2+."

  "description": "Comparing autotransporter \u03b2-domain configurations for their capacity to secrete heterologous proteins to the cell surfaceMonomeric autotransporters have been extensively used for export of recombinant proteins to the cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria. A bottleneck in the biosynthesis of such constructs is the passage of the outer membrane, which is facilitated by the \u03b2-domain at the C terminus of an autotransporter in conjunction with the Bam complex in the outer membrane. We have evaluated eight \u03b2-domain constructs for their capacity to secrete fused proteins to the cell surface. These constructs derive from the monomeric autotransporters Hbp, IgA protease, Ag43 and EstA and the trimeric autotransporter Hia, which all were selected because they have been previously used for secretion of recombinant proteins. We fused three different protein domains to the eight \u03b2-domain constructs, being a Myc-tag, the Hbp passenger and a nanobody or VHH domain, and assessed expression, membrane insertion and surface exposure. Our results show that expression levels differed considerably between the constructs tested. The constructs that included the \u03b2-domains of Hbp and IgA protease appeared the most efficient and resulted in expression levels that were detectable on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The VHH domain appeared the most difficult fusion partner to export, probably due to its complex immunoglobulin-like structure with a tertiary structure stabilized by an intramolecular disulfide bond. Overall, the Hbp \u03b2-domain compared favorably in exporting the fused recombinant proteins, because it showed in every instance tested a good level of expression, stable membrane insertion and clear surface exposure."

The tremendous power of this screening tool is illustrated by trace qualitative screening analysis of organohalogenated compounds (OHCs) in pet cat hair. Tentative identification was supported by mass spectral database searches and elemental formula prediction from the experimentally determined accurate mass data. This screening approach resulted in the first tentative identification of pentabromoethylbenzene, decabromodiphenyl ethane, hexabromocyclododecane, trisbromoneopentyl alcohol, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate and tris(2-chloroisopropyl)phosphate in the South African indoor environment. A total of seventy-two OHCs were identified in the samples and include known flame retardants, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and legacy contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine, organophosphorous and pyrethroid pesticides. The results obtained from cat hair indicate that these pets are exposed to complex mixtures of OHCs and the detection of these compounds suggests that non-invasive cat hair samples can be used to model indoor exposure with reference to external deposition of OHCs present in the air and dust surrounding people. Toddlers share the same environment as pet cats and therefore also the same health risks."

  "description": "Identification of novel PANDAR protein interaction partners involved in splicing regulationInteractions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) with proteins play important roles in the regulation of many cellular processes. PANDAR (Promotor of CDKN1A Antisense DNA damage Activated RNA) is a lncRNA that is transcribed in a p53-dependent manner from the CDKN1A promoter and is involved in the regulation of proliferation and senescence. Overexpression of PANDAR has been observed in several tumor species and correlated with a poor prognosis for patient survival rate. Depending on the cellular state, PANDAR is known to interact with proteins such as the nuclear transcription factor Y subunit A (NF-YA) and the scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A). However, a comprehensive analysis of the PANDAR interactome was missing so far. Therefore, we applied peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based pull-downs combined with quantitative mass spectrometry to identify new protein binding partners. We confirmed potential candidates like U2AF65 and PTBP1, known to be involved in RNA processing. Furthermore, we observed that overexpression of PANDAR leads to a reduced level of the short pro-apoptotic BCL-X splice variant (BCL-XS) which is regulated by PTBP1. Simultaneous overexpression of PTBP1 was able to rescue this effect. Overall, our data suggest a role for PANDAR in the regulation of splicing events via its interaction partner PTBP1."

  "description": "Alignment of microbial fitness with engineered product formation: Obligatory coupling between acetate production and photoautotrophic growthBackground: Microbial bioengineering has the potential to become a key contributor to the future development of human society by providing sustainable, novel, and cost-effective production pipelines. However, the sustained productivity of genetically engineered strains is often a challenge, as spontaneous non-producing mutants tend to grow faster and take over the population. Novel strategies to prevent this issue of strain instability are urgently needed. Results: In this study, we propose a novel strategy applicable to all microbial production systems for which a genome-scale metabolic model is available that aligns the production of native metabolites to the formation of biomass. Based on well-established constraint-based analysis techniques such as OptKnock and FVA, we developed an in silico pipeline - FRUITS - that specifically 'Finds Reactions Usable in Tapping Side-products'. It analyses a metabolic network to identify compounds produced in anabolism that are suitable to be coupled to growth by deletion of their re-utilization pathway(s), and computes their respective biomass and product formation rates. When applied to Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, a model cyanobacterium explored for sustainable bioproduction, a total of nine target metabolites were identified. We tested our approach for one of these compounds, acetate, which is used in a wide range of industrial applications. The model-guided engineered strain shows an obligatory coupling between acetate production and photoautotrophic growth as predicted. Furthermore, the stability of acetate productivity in this strain was confirmed by performing prolonged turbidostat cultivations. Conclusions: This work demonstrates a novel approach to stabilize the production of target compounds in cyanobacteria that culminated in the first report of a photoautotrophic growth-coupled cell factory. The method developed is generic and can easily be extended to any other modeled microbial production system."

  "description": "Ligand Displacement Exposes Binding Site Heterogeneity on CdSe Nanocrystal SurfacesNanocrystal-ligand interactions and ligand exchange processes are usually described by a uniform distribution of equal binding sites. Here, we analyze this assumption by a quantitative study of the displacement of Z-type cadmium oleate ligands from CdSe nanocrystals by addition of L-type ligands. First, we determined the stoichiometry of the displacement reaction by analyzing the equilibrium upon dilution using solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We found that 1 equiv of tetramethylethylene-1,2-diamine (TMEDA) or 2 equiv of n-butylamine or benzylamine bind to the displaced cadmium oleate. We only reached a comprehensive description of the displacement isotherm by including two types of binding sites with a different equilibrium constant. We corroborated this finding by density functional theory calculations on a CdSe model nanocrystal, which show that even single facets contain a broad variety of binding sites. Finally, we analyzed the thermodynamics of the displacement equilibrium for the weaker binding sites by constructing van't Hoff plots for the different displacers. Whereas displacement with TMEDA appears to be enthalpically neutral, it is entropically favorable. In contrast, displacement with the primary amines is entropically unfavorable but is associated with a negative change in enthalpy. Since the distribution of binding energy emanates from the large fraction of edge and vertex sites on a nanocrystal facet, these findings are most likely inherent to nanocrystals in general and should be considered when analyzing surface reactions on such materials."

A 92, 012520 (2015)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.92.012520] have given a counterexample to the conventional in reduced density-matrix functional theory representation of the second-order reduced density matrix (2RDM) \u0393ij,kl in the basis of the natural orbitals as a function \u0393ij,kl(n) of the orbital occupation numbers (ONs) ni. The observed nonuniqueness of \u0393ij,kl for prototype systems of different symmetry has been interpreted as the inherent inability of ON functions to reproduce the 2RDM, due to the insufficient information contained in the 1RDM spectrum. In this Comment, it is argued that, rather than totally invalidating \u0393ij,kl(n), the WK example exposes its symmetry dependence which, as well as the previously established analogous dependence in density functional theory, is demonstrated with a general formulation based on the Levy constrained search."

  "description": "Extraordinary Interfacial Stitching between Single All-Inorganic Perovskite NanocrystalsAll-inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are extensively studied because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties. Being of a cubic shape and typically featuring a narrow size distribution, CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) nanocrystals are the ideal starting material for the development of homogeneous thin films as required for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications. Recent experiments reveal spontaneous merging of drop-casted CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which is promoted by humidity and mild-temperature treatments and arrested by electron beam irradiation. Here, we make use of atom-resolved annular dark-field imaging microscopy and valence electron energy loss spectroscopy in a state-of-the-art low-voltage monochromatic scanning transmission electron microscope to investigate the aggregation between individual nanocrystals at the atomic level. We show that the merging process preserves the elemental composition and electronic structure of CsPbBr3 and takes place between nanocrystals of different sizes and orientations. In particular, we reveal seamless stitching for aligned nanocrystals, similar to that reported in the past for graphene flakes. Because the crystallographic alignment occurs naturally in drop-casted layers of CsPbX3 nanocrystals, our findings constitute the essential first step toward the development of large-area nanosheets with band gap energies predesigned by the nanocrystal choice - the gateway to large-scale photovoltaic applications of inorganic perovskites."

  "description": "Rational cell culture optimization enhances experimental reproducibility in cancer cellsOptimization of experimental conditions is critical in ensuring robust experimental reproducibility. Through detailed metabolomic analysis we found that cell culture conditions significantly impacted on glutaminase (GLS1) sensitivity resulting in variable sensitivity and irreproducibility in data. Baseline metabolite profiling highlighted that untreated cells underwent significant changes in metabolic status. Both the extracellular levels of glutamine and lactate and the intracellular levels of multiple metabolites changed drastically during the assay. We show that these changes compromise the robustness of the assay and make it difficult to reproduce. We discuss the implications of the cells' metabolic environment when studying the effects of perturbations to cell function by any type of inhibitor. We then devised 'metabolically rationalized standard' assay conditions, in which glutaminase-1 inhibition reduced glutamine metabolism differently in both cell lines assayed, and decreased the proliferation of one of them. The adoption of optimized conditions such as the ones described here should lead to an improvement in reproducibility and help eliminate false negatives as well as false positives in these assays."

  "description": "Nature of Intramolecular Resonance Assisted Hydrogen Bonding in Malonaldehyde and Its Saturated AnalogueThe nature of resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds (RAHB) is still subject of an ongoing debate. We therefore analyzed the \u03c3 and \u03c0 charge redistributions associated with the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds in malonaldehyde (MA) and its saturated analogue 3-hydroxypropanal (3-OH) and addressed the question whether there is a resonance assistance phenomenon in the sense of a synergistic interplay between the \u03c3 and \u03c0 electron systems. Our quantum chemical calculations at the BP86/TZ2P level of theory show that the \u03c0 charge flow is indeed in line with the Lewis structure as proposed by the RAHB model. This typical rearrangement of charge is only present in the unsaturated system, and not in its saturated analogue. Resonance in the \u03c0 electron system assists the intramolecular hydrogen bond by reducing the hydrogen bond distance, and by providing an additional stabilizing component to the net bonding energy. The \u03c3 orbital interaction plays an important role in the enhanced hydrogen bond strength in MA as well. However, there is no resonance assistance in the sense of an interplay between \u03c3 charge transfer and \u03c0 polarization; \u03c3 and \u03c0 contribute independently from each other."

  "description": "Metabolic enzyme cost explains variable trade-offs between microbial growth rate and yieldMicrobes may maximize the number of daughter cells per time or per amount of nutrients consumed. These two strategies correspond, respectively, to the use of enzyme-efficient or substrate-efficient metabolic pathways. In reality, fast growth is often associated with wasteful, yield-inefficient metabolism, and a general thermodynamic trade-off between growth rate and biomass yield has been proposed to explain this. We studied growth rate/yield trade-offs by using a novel modeling framework, Enzyme-Flux Cost Minimization (EFCM) and by assuming that the growth rate depends directly on the enzyme investment per rate of biomass production. In a comprehensive mathematical model of core metabolism in E. coli, we screened all elementary flux modes leading to cell synthesis, characterized them by the growth rates and yields they provide, and studied the shape of the resulting rate/yield Pareto front. By varying the model parameters, we found that the rate/yield trade-off is not universal, but depends on metabolic kinetics and environmental conditions. A prominent trade-off emerges under oxygen-limited growth, where yield-inefficient pathways support a 2-to-3 times higher growth rate than yield-efficient pathways. EFCM can be widely used to predict optimal metabolic states and growth rates under varying nutrient levels, perturbations of enzyme parameters, and single or multiple gene knockouts."

  "description": "The novel antibiotic rhodomyrtone traps membrane proteins in vesicles with increased fluidityThe acylphloroglucinol rhodomyrtone is a promising new antibiotic isolated from the rose myrtle Rhodomyrtus tomentosa, a plant used in Asian traditional medicine. While many studies have demonstrated its antibacterial potential in a variety of clinical applications, very little is known about the mechanism of action of rhodomyrtone. Preceding studies have been focused on intracellular targets, but no specific intracellular protein could be confirmed as main target. Using live cell, high-resolution, and electron microscopy we demonstrate that rhodomyrtone causes large membrane invaginations with a dramatic increase in fluidity, which attract a broad range of membrane proteins. Invaginations then form intracellular vesicles, thereby trapping these proteins. Aberrant protein localization impairs several cellular functions, including the respiratory chain and the ATP synthase complex. Being uncharged and devoid of a particular amphipathic structure, rhodomyrtone did not seem to be a typical membrane-inserting molecule. In fact, molecular dynamics simulations showed that instead of inserting into the bilayer, rhodomyrtone transiently binds to phospholipid head groups and causes distortion of lipid packing, providing explanations for membrane fluidization and induction of membrane curvature. Both its transient binding mode and its ability to form protein-trapping membrane vesicles are unique, making it an attractive new antibiotic candidate with a novel mechanism of action."

The protective role of the polymorphic NQO1 and NQO2 enzymes is especially of interest in the liver as the major site of drug bioactivation to chemically reactive drug metabolites. In the current study, we quantified the concentrations of NQO1 and NQO2 in 20 human liver donors and NQO1 and NQO2 activities with quinone-like drug metabolites. Hepatic NQO1 concentrations ranged from 8 to 213 nM. Using recombinant NQO1, we showed that low nM concentrations of NQO1 are sufficient to reduce synthetic amodiaquine and carbamazepine quinone-like metabolites in vitro. Hepatic NQO2 concentrations ranged from 2 to 31 \u03bcM. NQO2 catalyzed the reduction of quinone-like metabolites derived from acetaminophen, clozapine, 4\u2032-hydroxydiclofenac, mefenamic acid, amodiaquine, and carbamazepine. The reduction of the clozapine nitrenium ion supports association studies showing that NQO2 is a genetic risk factor for clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. The 5-hydroxydiclofenac quinone imine, which was previously shown to be reduced by NQO1, was not reduced by NQO2. Tacrine was identified as a potent NQO2 inhibitor and was applied to further confirm the catalytic activity of NQO2 in these assays. While the in vivo relevance of NQO2-catalyzed reduction of quinone-like metabolites remains to be established by identification of the physiologically relevant co-substrates, our results suggest an additional protective role of the NQO2 protein by non-enzymatic scavenging of quinone-like metabolites. Hepatic NQO1 activity in detoxication of quinone-like metabolites becomes especially important when other detoxication pathways are exhausted and NQO1 levels are induced."

  "description": "Designing Self-Assembled Rosettes: Why Ammeline is a Superior Building Block to MelamineIn supramolecular chemistry, the rational design of self-assembled systems remains a challenge. Herein, hydrogen-bonded rosettes of melamine and ammeline have been theoretically examined by using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D). Our bonding analyses, based on quantitative Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory and corresponding energy decomposition analyses (EDA), show that ammeline is a much better building block than melamine for the fabrication of cyclic complexes based on hydrogen bonds. This superior capacity is explained by both stronger hydrogen bonding and the occurrence of a strong synergy."

  "description": "Half-Sandwich Metal-Catalyzed Alkyne [2+2+2] Cycloadditions and the Slippage Span ModelHalf-sandwich RhI compounds display good catalytic activity toward alkyne [2+2+2] cycloadditions. A peculiar structural feature of these catalysts is the coordination of the metal to an aromatic moiety, typically a cyclopentadienyl anion, and, in particular, the possibility to change the bonding mode easily by the metal slipping over this aromatic moiety. Upon modifying the ancillary ligands, or proceeding along the catalytic cycle, hapticity changes can be observed; it varies from \u03b75, if the five metal\u2013carbon distances are identical, through \u03b73+\u03b72, in the presence of allylic distortion, and \u03b73, in the case of allylic coordination, to \u03b71, if a \u03c3 metal\u2013carbon bond forms. In this study, we present the slippage span model, derived with the aim of establishing a relationship between slippage variation during the catalytic cycle, quantified in a novel and rigorous way, and the performance of catalysts in terms of turnover frequency, computed with the energy span model. By collecting and comparing new data and data from the literature, we find that the highest performance is associated with the smallest slippage variation along the cycle."

  "description": "Mining inter-relationships in online scientific articles and its visualization: Natural language processing for systems biology modelingWith the rapid growth in the numbers of scientific publications in domains such as neuroscience and medicine, visually interlinking documents in online databases such as PubMed with the purpose of indicating the context of a query results can improve the multi-disciplinary relevance of the search results. Translational medicine and systems biology rely on studies relating basic sciences to applications, often going through multiple disciplinary domains. This paper focuses on the design and development of a new scientific document visualization platform, which allows inferring translational aspects in biosciences within published articles using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) methods. From online databases, this software platform effectively extracted relationship connections between multiple subdomains within neuroscience derived from abstracts related to user query. In our current implementation, the document visualization platform employs two clustering algorithms namely Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) and LINGO. Clustering quality was improved by mapping top-ranked cluster labels derived from an UMLS-Metathesaurus using a scoring function. To avoid non-clustered documents, an iterative scheme, called auto-clustering was developed and this allowed mapping previously uncategorized documents during the initial grouping process to relevant clusters. The efficacy of this document clustering and visualization platform was evaluated by expert-based validation of clustering results obtained with unique search terms. Compared to normal clustering, auto-clustering demonstrated better efficacy by generating larger numbers of unique and relevant cluster labels. Using this implementation, a Parkinson's disease systems theory model was developed and studies based on user queries related to neuroscience and oncology have been showcased as applications."

This study evaluated probiotic enrichment and detoxification of kwete, a commonly consumed traditional fermented cereal beverage in Uganda, by the use of starter culture with the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 and Streptococcus thermophilus C106. Probiotic kwete was produced by fermenting a suspension of ground maize grain at 30 \u00b0C for a period of 24 h, leading to a decrease of the pH value to \u2264 4.0 and increase in titratable acidity of at least 0.2% (w/v). Probiotic kwete was acceptable to the consumers with a score of \u22656 on a 9-point hedonic scale. The products were stable over a month's study period with a mean pH of 3.9, titratable acidity of 0.6% (w/v), and Lactobacillus rhamnosus counts >10\u2078 cfu g-1. HPLC analysis of aflatoxins of the water-soluble fraction of kwete indicated that fermentation led to an over 1000-fold reduction of aflatoxins B\u2081, B\u2082, G\u2081, and G\u2082 spiked in the raw ingredients. In vitro fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed binding of aflatoxin B\u2081 to Lactobacillus rhamnosus with an efficiency of 83.5%. This study shows that fermentation is a means to enrich with probiotics and reduce widely occurring aflatoxin contamination of maize products that are consumed as staple foods in sub-Saharan Africa."

  "description": "Three-dimensional bifurcation analysis of a predator-prey model with uncertain formulationAn issue in mathematical modeling is that multiple models describe the same data based on different but all acceptable theoretical assumptions. To take this uncertainty in model construction into account, the classical parameter sensitivity analysis needs to be extended to consider alternative choices in model formulation. This is particularly important in population biology, where a single function often summarizes mechanisms from the physiological to the population level. Predictions based on population models were recently shown to be sometimes highly sensitive to the function that models predation. This so-called structural sensitivity extends the classical structural stability. It arises from differences between the bifurcation diagrams based on alternative model formulations. Here, we ask through an example of a predator-prey system that exhibits complex bifurcations (involving limit cycles and homoclinic orbits) how the qualitative changes in bifurcations occur during a small continuous switch between two acceptable model formulations. In this model, fixed parameter values are estimated from empirical data, free parameters allow one to explore a wide range of environmental conditions and species, and a remaining parameter makes a switch between two predation formulations. Thus, the change in model formulation becomes a parameter sensitivity problem that is studied by bifurcation analysis. A three-dimensional analysis revealed that most changes that occur with the change in formulation are related to a codimension-three degenerated Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Its canonical unfolding is derived, and its analysis highlights the differences in the phase portraits predicted with the two model formulations. Differences that are not related to this bifurcation are also discussed. The discussion ends with some perspectives toward the quantification of prediction uncertainty due to uncertainty in model structure in ecology, and possibly in other fields involving the modeling of complex systems."

  "description": "Characterization of kinetics of human cytochrome P450s involved in bioactivation of flucloxacillin: inhibition of CYP3A-catalysed hydroxylation by sulfaphenazoleBackground and Purpose: The aim of this study was to characterize the human cytochrome P450s (CYPs) involved in oxidative bioactivation of flucloxacillin to 5-hydroxymethyl flucloxacillin, a metabolite with high cytotoxicity towards biliary epithelial cells. Experimental Approach: The CYPs involved in hydroxylation of flucloxacillin were characterized using recombinant human CYPs, pooled liver microsomes in the presence of CYP-specific inhibitors and by correlation analysis using a panel of liver microsomes from 16 donors. Key Results: Recombinant CYPs showing the highest specific activity were CYP3A4, CYP3A7 and to lower extent CYP2C9 and CTP2C8. Michaelis\u2013Menten enzyme kinetics were determined for pooled human liver microsomes, recombinant CYP3A4, CYP3A7 and CYP2C9. Surprisingly, sulfaphenazole appeared to be a potent inhibitor of 5\u2032-hydroxylation of flucloxacillin by both recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP3A7. Conclusions and Implications: The combined results show that the 5\u2032-hydroxylation of flucloxacillin is primarily catalysed by CYP3A4, CYP3A7 and CYP2C9. The large variability of the hepatic expression of these enzymes could affect the formation of 5\u2032-hydroxymethyl flucloxacillin, which may determine the differences in susceptibility to flucloxacillin-induced liver injury. Additionally, the strong inhibition in CYP3A-catalysed flucloxacillin metabolism by sulfaphenazole suggests that unanticipated drug\u2013drug interactions could occur with coadministered drugs."

The cover picture shows a colored pallet of melamine and ammeline tautomers that form hydrogen-bonded hexameric rosettes. When it comes to self-assembling capabilities, one of the ammeline structures (red) is shown to be distinctly superior to melamine, both in the gas phase and in water. Quantum chemical computations explain that this is due to the presence of stronger pair interactions and the manifestation of a large cooperativity effect.

  "description": "Neural plasticity and adult neurogenesis: the deep biology perspectiveThe recognition that neurogenesis does not stop with adolescence has spun off research towards the reduction of brain disorders by enhancing brain regeneration. Adult neurogenesis is one of the tougher problems of developmental biology as it requires the generation of complex intracellular and pericellular anatomies, amidst the danger of neuroinflammation. We here review how a multitude of regulatory pathways optimized for early neurogenesis has to be revamped into a new choreography of time dependencies. Distinct pathways need to be regulated, ranging from neural growth factor induced differentiation to mitochondrial bioenergetics, reactive oxygen metabolism, and apoptosis. Requiring much Gibbs energy consumption, brain depends on aerobic energy metabolism, hence on mitochondrial activity. Mitochondrial fission and fusion, movement and perhaps even mitoptosis, thereby come into play. All these network processes are interlinked and involve a plethora of molecules. We recommend a deep thinking approach to adult neurobiology."

  "description": "Automated partial atomic charge assignment for drug-like molecules: A fast knapsack approachA key factor in computational drug design is the consistency and reliability with which intermolecular interactions between a wide variety of molecules can be described. Here we present a procedure to efficiently, reliably and automatically assign partial atomic charges to atoms based on known distributions. We formally introduce the molecular charge assignment problem, where the task is to select a charge from a set of candidate charges for every atom of a given query molecule. Charges are accompanied by a score that depends on their observed frequency in similar neighbourhoods (chemical environments) in a database of previously parameterised molecules. The aim is to assign the charges such that the total charge equals a known target charge within a margin of error while maximizing the sum of the charge scores. We show that the problem is a variant of the well-studied multiple-choice knapsack problem and thus weakly \\mathcal {NP} NP -complete. We propose solutions based on Integer Linear Programming and a pseudo-polynomial time Dynamic Programming algorithm. We demonstrate that the results obtained for novel molecules not included in the database are comparable to the ones obtained performing explicit charge calculations while decreasing the time to determine partial charges for a molecule from hours or even days to below a second. Our software is openly available."

The device was used for the simultaneous extraction and concentration of small molecule pharmaceuticals from urine, which was followed by an on-chip electrophoretic separation of the concentrated targets for quantitative analysis. Owing to the high level of functional integration inside the device, manual handling was minimal and restricted to the introduction of the sample and buffer solutions. The 3D printed sample-in/answer-out device allowed the direct quantification of ampicillin - a small molecule pharmaceutical - in untreated urine within 3 min, down to 2 ppm. These results demonstrate the potential of 3D printing for on-demand fabrication of disposable, functionally integrated devices for low-cost point-of-collection (POC) diagnostics."

Here we use ultrafast transient absorption and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to clarify the movement of excitons and charges in reduced-dimensional perovskite solids. We report excitonic funneling from strongly to weakly confined perovskite quantum wells within 150 fs, facilitated by strong spectral overlap and orientational alignment among neighboring wells. This energy transfer happens on time scales orders of magnitude faster than charge transfer, which we find to occur instead over 10s to 100s of picoseconds.

  "description": "Overview of known plastic packaging-associated chemicals and their hazardsGlobal plastics production has reached 380 million metric tons in 2015, with around 40% used for packaging. Plastic packaging is diverse and made of multiple polymers and numerous additives, along with other components, such as adhesives or coatings. Further, packaging can contain residues from substances used during manufacturing, such as solvents, along with non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), such as impurities, oligomers, or degradation products. To characterize risks from chemicals potentially released during manufacturing, use, disposal, and/or recycling of packaging, comprehensive information on all chemicals involved is needed. Here, we present a database of Chemicals associated with Plastic Packaging (CPPdb), which includes chemicals used during manufacturing and/or present in final packaging articles. The CPPdb lists 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging and 3377 substances that are possibly associated. Of the 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging, 63 rank highest for human health hazards and 68 for environmental hazards according to the harmonized hazard classifications assigned by the European Chemicals Agency within the Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP) regulation implementing the United Nations\u2019 Globally Harmonized System (GHS). Further, 7 of the 906 substances are classified in the European Union as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT), or very persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB), and 15 as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Thirty-four of the 906 chemicals are also recognized as EDC or potential EDC in the recent EDC report by the United Nations Environment Programme. The identified hazardous chemicals are used in plastics as monomers, intermediates, solvents, surfactants, plasticizers, stabilizers, biocides, flame retardants, accelerators, and colorants, among other functions. Our work was challenged by a lack of transparency and incompleteness of publicly available information on both the use and toxicity of numerous substances. The most hazardous chemicals identified here should be assessed in detail as potential candidates for substitution."

  "description": "In vivo characterisation of fluorescent proteins in budding yeastFluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used in many organisms, but are commonly characterised in vitro. However, the in vitro properties may poorly reflect in vivo performance. Therefore, we characterised 27 FPs in vivo using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model organism. We linked the FPs via a T2A peptide to a control FP, producing equimolar expression of the 2 FPs from 1 plasmid. Using this strategy, we characterised the FPs for brightness, photostability, photochromicity and pH-sensitivity, achieving a comprehensive in vivo characterisation. Many FPs showed different in vivo properties compared to existing in vitro data. Additionally, various FPs were photochromic, which affects readouts due to complex bleaching kinetics. Finally, we codon optimized the best performing FPs for optimal expression in yeast, and found that codon-optimization alters FP characteristics. These FPs improve experimental signal readout, opening new experimental possibilities. Our results may guide future studies in yeast that employ fluorescent proteins."

  "description": "Integration of single-cell RNA-seq data into population models to characterize cancer metabolismMetabolic reprogramming is a general feature of cancer cells. Regrettably, the comprehensive quantification of metabolites in biological specimens does not promptly translate into knowledge on the utilization of metabolic pathways. By estimating fluxes across metabolic pathways, computational models hold the promise to bridge this gap between data and biological functionality. These models currently portray the average behavior of cell populations however, masking the inherent heterogeneity that is part and parcel of tumorigenesis as much as drug resistance. To remove this limitation, we propose single-cell Flux Balance Analysis (scFBA) as a computational framework to translate single-cell transcriptomes into single-cell fluxomes. We show that the integration of single-cell RNA-seq profiles of cells derived from lung adenocarcinoma and breast cancer patients into a multi-scale stoichiometric model of a cancer cell population: significantly 1) reduces the space of feasible single-cell fluxomes; 2) allows to identify clusters of cells with different growth rates within the population; 3) points out the possible metabolic interactions among cells via exchange of metabolites. The scFBA suite of MATLAB functions is available at https://github.com/ BIMIB-DISCo/scFBA, as well as the case study datasets."

  "description": "A proteome-integrated, carbon source dependent genetic regulatory network in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeIntegrated regulatory networks can be powerful tools to examine and test properties of cellular systems, such as modelling environmental effects on the molecular bioeconomy, where protein levels are altered in response to changes in growth conditions. Although extensive regulatory pathways and protein interaction data sets exist which represent such networks, few have formally considered quantitative proteomics data to validate and extend them. We generate and consider such data here using a label-free proteomics strategy to quantify alterations in protein abundance for S. cerevisiae when grown on minimal media using glucose, galactose, maltose and trehalose as sole carbon sources. Using a high quality-controlled subset of proteins observed to be differentially abundant, we constructed a proteome-informed network, comprising 1850 transcription factor interactions and 37 chaperone interactions, which defines the major changes in the cellular proteome when growing under different carbon sources. Analysis of the differentially abundant proteins involved in the regulatory network pointed to their significant roles in specific metabolic pathways and function, including glucose homeostasis, amino acid biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolic process. We noted strong statistical enrichment in the differentially abundant proteome of targets of known transcription factors associated with stress responses and altered carbon metabolism. This shows how such integrated analysis can lend further experimental support to annotated regulatory interactions, since the proteomic changes capture both magnitude and direction of gene expression change at the level of the affected proteins. Overall this study highlights the power of quantitative proteomics to help define regulatory systems pertinent to environmental conditions."

  "description": "Microdroplet screening and selection for improved microbial production of extracellular compoundsMicroorganisms produce extracellular compounds that affect the final product quality in fermentation processes. Selection of overproducing mutants requires coupling of the extracellular product to the producer genotype, which can be achieved by single-cell compartmentalization. Emulsions contain up to billions of microdroplets/mL which significantly increases the screening throughput compared to microtiter-plate-based selections. Factors affecting the success of screening in microdroplets include the nature of the producing organism (robust, no invasive growth), the product (not soluble in oil) and the product assay (preferably fluorescence based). Together these factors determine the required microdroplet production technique and sorting set-up. Because microdroplets allow relatively inexpensive ultrahigh-throughput screening, they are likely to become a standard tool in the strain selection toolbox of the fermentation industry."

This protocol aims to provide chemists with the tools to implement a powerful and robust method for analyzing and understanding any chemical reaction using PyFrag 2019. The approach is based on the so-called activation strain model (ASM) of reactivity, which relates the relative energy of a molecular system to the sum of the energies required to distort the reactants into the geometries required to react plus the strength of their mutual interactions. Other available methods analyze only a stationary point on the potential energy surface, but our methodology analyzes the change in energy along a reaction coordinate. The use of this methodology has been proven to be critical to the understanding of reactions, spanning the realms of the inorganic and organic, as well as the supramolecular and biochemical, fields. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions\u2014starting from the optimization of the stationary points and extending through calculation of the potential energy surface and analysis of the trend-decisive energy terms\u2014that can serve as a guide for carrying out the analysis of any given reaction of interest within hours to days, depending on the size of the molecular system."

  "description": "Vision of a near future: Bridging the human health\u2013environment divide: Toward an integrated strategy to understand mechanisms across species for chemical safety assessmentThere is a growing recognition that application of mechanistic approaches to understand cross-species shared molecular targets and pathway conservation in the context of hazard characterization, provide significant opportunities in risk assessment (RA) for both human health and environmental safety. Specifically, it has been recognized that a more comprehensive and reliable understanding of similarities and differences in biological pathways across a variety of species will better enable cross-species extrapolation of potential adverse toxicological effects. Ultimately, this would also advance the generation and use of mechanistic data for both human health and environmental RA. A workshop brought together representatives from industry, academia and government to discuss how to improve the use of existing data, and to generate new NAMs data to derive better mechanistic understanding between humans and environmentally-relevant species, ultimately resulting in holistic chemical safety decisions. Thanks to a thorough dialogue among all participants, key challenges, current gaps and research needs were identified, and potential solutions proposed. This discussion highlighted the common objective to progress toward more predictive, mechanistically based, data-driven and animal-free chemical safety assessments. Overall, the participants recognized that there is no single approach which would provide all the answers for bridging the gap between mechanism-based human health and environmental RA, but acknowledged we now have the incentive, tools and data availability to address this concept, maximizing the potential for improvements in both human health and environmental RA."

  "description": "The common message of constraint-based optimization approaches: overflow metabolism is caused by two growth-limiting constraintsLiving cells can express different metabolic pathways that support growth. The criteria that determine which pathways are selected in which environment remain unclear. One recurrent selection is overflow metabolism: the simultaneous usage of an ATP-efficient and -inefficient pathway, shown for example in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and cancer cells. Many models, based on different assumptions, can reproduce this observation. Therefore, they provide no conclusive evidence which mechanism is causing overflow metabolism. We compare the mathematical structure of these models. Although ranging from flux balance analyses to self-fabricating metabolism and expression models, we can rewrite all models into one standard form. We conclude that all models predict overflow metabolism when two, model-specific, growth-limiting constraints are hit. This is consistent with recent theory. Thus, identifying these two constraints is essential for understanding overflow metabolism. We list all imposed constraints by these models, so that they can hopefully be tested in future experiments."

  "description": "Hydrogen-bonded rosettes of aminotriazines for selective-ion recognitionIon recognition is still an emerging topic in supramolecular chemistry and has aroused great attention in the last few years. In this work, we have examined the assemblies of selected hexameric rosettes of melamine and ammeline and their capacities to host halide and alkali ions in the gas phase and in water. Using relativistic dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D), we first studied the stability and the effect of introducing monovalent anions (Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212) and cations (Na+, K+, and Rb+) in the center of the rosette\u2019s cavity. Finally, we explored the interactions in two stacked rosettes with an interlayer ion. Our computations reveal that amine-substituted triazines are promising candidates for anion and cation recognition either in self-assembled monolayers or pillar array structures. The anion recognition process is governed by both the electrostatic and charge-transfer (donor\u2212acceptor) interactions, while the cation recognition is governed by electrostatic and polarization. In addition, melamine and ammeline could constitute a potent mixture for dual-ion recognition strategies."

  "description": "Optimizing employee creativity in the digital era: Uncovering the interactional effects of abilities, motivations, and opportunitiesAn increasing digitalization in all aspects of life and work reshapes traditional assumptions about human creativity. Both scholars and practitioners raise many questions with regards to how to stimulate employee creativity in the digital work context. While there are many studies that examine predictors of employee creativity, little effort has been made thus far to synthesize these findings in way that would provide meaningful guidance to organizations and to provide bases for future research. With this paper we aim to contribute to filling this gap. We systematically review empirical studies on predictors of employee creativity published in the past 30 years and organize findings following an established human resources management framework: Ability\u2013Motivation\u2013Opportunity (AMO) theory. This organizing framework enables us to clearly depict how contextual factors (a) separately and (b) jointly influence individual employee creativity. Specifically, it enables us to depict two possible models\u2014combination and multiplicative models\u2014through which contextual factors interact with individual factors in predicting employee creativity. Through synthesizing evidence for each of the models, we demonstrate to scholars and practitioners what is known about the interactional effects of contextual and personal factors on employee creativity, and what still needs to be studied if we are to take the field of research on creativity in the digital era forward."

Here, we describe a panel of novel C3-symmetric tris-electrophilic agents and their use for the cyclization of proteins. These electrophiles are reacted with a protein domain harboring three solvent-exposed cysteine residues, resulting in the in situ cyclization of the protein (INCYPRO). We observe a clear dependency of cross-linking rates on the electrophilicity. All nine obtained cross-linked protein versions show considerably increased thermal stability (up to 29 \u00b0C increased melting temperature) when compared to that of the linear precursor. Most interestingly, the degree of stabilization correlates with the hydrophilicity of the cross-link. These results will support the development of novel cross-linked proteins and enable a more rational design process."

Adequate flow-confinement measures are necessary. Here, the use of permeability differences across different compartments of spatial two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) LC devices as a method to guide fluid flow and reduce analyte loss during the first, second- and third-dimension development was investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In case of 2DLC devices, it was shown that porous barriers with a permeability on the order of 10\u221212 m2 suffice to keep the total sample spillage from an open 1D channel under 1%. In case of 3DLC devices, it was shown that flow confinement could be achieved using an open 1D channel in combination with a highly-permeable monolith (permeability on the order of 10\u221212 m2) in the second-dimension (2D) and a less permeable packing with a permeability on the order of 10\u221215 m2 (e.g. 1 \u03bcm particles) in the third-dimension (3D). Additionally, the impact of the 3D flow-distributor has been studied and a novel design, capable of limiting the spillage to the other dimensions to the absolute minimum, is proposed."

As demonstrated by systematic benchmarks, dimerization and isomerization energies obtained with our code using STO basis sets of triple-\u03b6-quality show mean absolute deviations from Gaussian type orbital, canonical, basis set limit extrapolated, global density fitting (DF)-MP2 results of less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we introduce a quadratic scaling atomic orbital based spin-opposite-scaled (SOS)-MP2 approach with a very small prefactor. Due to a worst-case scaling of [Formula: see text], our implementation is very fast already for small systems and shows an exceptionally early crossover to canonical SOS-PARI-MP2. We report computational wall time results for linear as well as for realistic three-dimensional molecules and show that triple-\u03b6 quality calculations on molecules of several hundreds of atoms are only a matter of a few hours on a single compute node, the bottleneck of the computations being the SCF rather than the post-SCF energy correction."

Linear interaction energy (LIE) is an efficient in silico method for \u0394Gbind computation. LIE models can be trained and used to directly calculate binding affinities from interaction energies involving ligands in the bound and unbound states only, and LIE can be combined with statistical weighting to calculate \u0394Gbind for flexible proteins that may bind their ligands in multiple orientations. Here, we investigate if LIE predictions can be effectively improved by explicitly including the entropy of (de)solvation into our free-energy calculations. For that purpose, we combine LIE calculations for the protein-ligand-bound state with explicit free-energy perturbation to rigorously compute the unbound ligand's solvation free energy. We show that for 28 Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) ligands, coupling LIE with alchemical solvation free-energy calculation helps to improve obtained correlation between computed and reference (experimental) binding data."

By using a quantitative Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) approach, in combination with time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), the influence of various structural and electronic tuning parameters on the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of a benzenoid model dye have been investigated. These parameters include 1) out-of-plane bending of the aromatic core, 2) bending of the bridge with respect to the core, 3) the nature of the bridge itself, and 4) \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking. The study reveals the coupling of multiple structural distortions as a function of bridge length and number of bridges in benzene to be chiefly responsible for a decreased HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, and consequently, red-shifting of the absorption wavelength associated with the lowest singlet excitation (\u03bb\u2248560 nm) in the model cyclophane systems. These physical insights together with a rational approach for tuning the oscillator strength were leveraged for the proof-of-concept design of an intense near-infrared (NIR) absorbing cyclophane dye at \u03bb=785 nm. This design may contribute to a new class of distortion-controlled NIR absorbing organic dye molecules."

Within the T7S systems of mycobacteria, also known as the ESX systems, MycP is essential for secretion, which is probably linked to its stabilizing effect on the ESX membrane complex. However, it is unknown how this is mediated, as MycP is not a stable component of this complex. In this study, we set out to create a chimeric fusion protein of EccB5 and MycP5, based on a chimeric gene of eccB and mycP in the T7S locus of Bifidobacterium dentium. We show that this fusion protein is functional and capable of complementing ESX-5 secretion in both an eccB5 and a mycP5 knockout in Mycobacterium marinum. To study the ESX complex containing this fusion protein in more detail, we replaced the original eccB5 and mycP5 of the Mycobacterium xenopi esx-5 locus, reconstituted in Mycobacterium smegmatis, with the chimeric gene. The EccB5-MycP5 fusion construct also restored ESX-5 secretion under these double knockout conditions. Subsequent protein pulldowns on the central complex component EccC5 showed that under these conditions, the EccB5-MycP5 fusion was specifically copurified and a stable component of the ESX-5 complex. Based on our results, we can conclude that MycP5 carries out its essential function in secretion in close proximity to EccB5, indicating that EccB5 is the direct interaction partner of MycP5."

  "description": "Complex Stability and an Irrevertible Transition Reverted by Peptide and Fibroblasts in a Dynamic Model of Innate ImmunityWe here apply a control analysis and various types of stability analysis to an in silico model of innate immunity that addresses the management of inflammation by a therapeutic peptide. Motivation is the observation, both in silico and in experiments, that this therapy is not robust. Our modeling results demonstrate how (1) the biological phenomena of acute and chronic modes of inflammation may reflect an inherently complex bistability with an irrevertible flip between the two modes, (2) the chronic mode of the model has stable, sometimes unique, steady states, while its acute-mode steady states are stable but not unique, (3) as witnessed by TNF levels, acute inflammation is controlled by multiple processes, whereas its chronic-mode inflammation is only controlled by TNF synthesis and washout, (4) only when the antigen load is close to the acute mode's flipping point, many processes impact very strongly on cells and cytokines, (5) there is no antigen exposure level below which reduction of the antigen load alone initiates a flip back to the acute mode, and (6) adding healthy fibroblasts makes the transition from acute to chronic inflammation revertible, although (7) there is a window of antigen load where such a therapy cannot be effective. This suggests that triple therapies may be essential to overcome chronic inflammation. These may comprise (1) anti-immunoglobulin light chain peptides, (2) a temporarily reduced antigen load, and (3a) fibroblast repopulation or (3b) stem cell strategies."

A third GlyR \u03b11\u03b2-GPHN-IQSEC2 complex exists at the lowest amount with a mass similar to the IQSEC3 containing complex. Using yeast two-hybrid it is demonstrated that IQSEC3 interacts with the GlyR complex by binding to the GPHN G domain at the N-terminal of the IQSEC3 IQ-like domain. The data provide direct evidence of the interaction of IQSEC3 with GlyR-GPHN complexes, underscoring a potential role of these ArfGEFs in the function of glycinergic synapses."

  "description": "Evaluation of the Alicyclic Gauche Effect in 2-Fluorocyclohexanone Analogs: a Combined NMR and DFT StudyHerein, we have investigated the effect of an endocyclic group (forming the N\u2013C\u2013C\u2013F fragment) on the conformational preferences of 2-fluorocyclohexanone analogs. A combined approach of nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations was employed to assess the conformational equilibrium in several media. In turn, natural bond orbital analysis and the conformational behavior of other 2-halocyclohexanone analogs were used to get more insights about the intramolecular interactions governing the conformer stabilities. Our results reveal that any stabilization from interactions featured in the gauche effect is overcome by a short-range interaction of the fluorine substituent with the carbonyl group. Consequently, the gauche effect in heterocyclic compounds is not as stabilizing as in their acyclic counterparts. Only the electrostatic gauche effect takes place even in polar solvents owing to an attraction between the axial fluorine and an endocyclic quaternary ammonium group."

Because allylation can occur at either the N1 or N2 position of the 1,2,3-benzotriazole, the complete Gibbs free energy profiles for both pathways were computed. A kinetic preference emerged for the experimentally observed N1 allylation with the JoSPOphos ligand, whereas N2 allylation was favored with DPEphos. Analysis of the regiodetermining oxidative addition step by using the activation strain model in conjunction with a matching energy decomposition analysis has revealed that the unprecedented N2 reaction regioselectivity is dictated by the strength of the electrostatic interactions between the 1,2,3-benzotriazole and the rhodium catalyst. The nature of the electrostatic interaction was rationalized by analysis of the electrostatic potential maps and Hirshfeld charges: a stabilizing electrostatic interaction was found between the key atoms involved in the oxidative addition for the N2 pathway, analogous interactions are weaker in the N1 case."

  "description": "The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor \u03c3VreI is active during infection and contributes to phosphate starvation-induced virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosaThe extracytoplasmic function sigma factor \u03c3VreI of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes transcription of potential virulence determinants, including secretion systems and secreted proteins. Its activity is modulated by the VreR anti-\u03c3 factor that inhibits the binding of \u03c3VreI to the RNA polymerase in the absence of a (still unknown) inducing signal. The vreI-vreR genes are expressed under inorganic phosphate (Pi) starvation, a physiological condition often encountered in the host that increases P. aeruginosa pathogenicity. However, whether or not \u03c3VreI is active in vivo during infection and contributes to the Pi starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen has not been analyzed yet. Using zebrafish embryos and a human alveolar basal epithelial cell line as P. aeruginosa hosts, we demonstrate in this work that \u03c3VreI is active during infection and that lack of \u03c3VreI considerably reduces the Pi starvation-induced virulence of this pathogen. Surprisingly, lack of the \u03c3VreI inhibitor, the VreR anti-\u03c3 factor, also diminishes the virulence of P. aeruginosa. By transcriptomic analyses we show that VreR modulates gene expression not only in a \u03c3VreI-dependent but also in a \u03c3VreI-independent manner. This includes potential virulence determinants and transcriptional regulators that could be responsible for the reduced virulence of the \u0394vreR mutant."

The oxidative pathway from Caulobacter crescentus has been employed in in-vivo metabolic engineering with intact cells and in in-vitro enzyme cascades. The performance of such engineering approaches is often hampered by systems complexity, caused by non-linear kinetics and allosteric regulatory mechanisms. Here we report an iterative approach to construct and validate a quantitative model for the Weimberg pathway. Two sensitive points in pathway performance have been identified as follows: (1) product inhibition of the dehydrogenases (particularly in the absence of an efficient NAD+ recycling mechanism) and (2) balancing the activities of the dehydratases. The resulting model is utilized to design enzyme cascades for optimized conversion and to analyse pathway performance in C. cresensus cell-free extracts."

  "description": "Adapting free energy perturbation simulations for large macrocyclic ligands: how to dissect contributions from direct binding and free ligand flexibilityLarge and flexible ligands gain increasing interest in the development of bioactive agents. They challenge the applicability of computational ligand optimization strategies originally developed for small molecules. Free energy perturbation (FEP) is often used for predicting binding affinities of small molecule ligands, however, its use for more complex ligands remains limited. Herein, we report the structure-based design of peptide macrocycles targeting the protein binding site of human adaptor protein 14-3-3. We observe a surprisingly strong dependency of binding affinities on relatively small variations in substituent size. FEP was performed to rationalize observed trends. To account for insufficient convergence of FEP, restrained calculations were performed and complemented with extensive REST MD simulations of the free ligands. These calculations revealed that changes in affinity originate both from altered direct interactions and conformational changes of the free ligand. In addition, MD simulations provided the basis to rationalize unexpected trends in ligand lipophilicity. We also verified the anticipated interaction site and binding mode for one of the high affinity ligands by X-ray crystallography. The introduced fully-atomistic simulation protocol can be used to rationalize the development of structurally complex ligands which will support future ligand maturation efforts."

  "description": "An Environmental Dilemma for China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Explosion of Disposable Plastic WastesPlastic pollution control has been on top of the political agenda in China. In January 2020, China announced a phased ban on the production and usage of various types of single-use plastics as a solution to environmental pollution problems. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 seems to be a new obstacle to the ban on single-use plastic products. To basically satisfied the daily necessities and contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 under the background of the regular epidemic prevention and control in China, online ordering, contactless delivery and wearing mask have become an important and feasible way of daily life. However, the unrestrained use of disposable plastic bags, lunch boxes and masks within the nationwide quarantine leads to hundreds of millions of plastics wastes every day. The potential environmental pollution caused by the use of disposable plastic products during the pandemic should arouse social concern. The Chinese government should manage environmental protection in parallel with anti-pandemic endeavors as the situation of the pandemic evolves."

It is a variation of the well-studied k-mismatch problem. A multitude of papers has been devoted to solving the k-CPM problem, but only average-case upper bounds are known. In this paper, we present the first non-trivial worst-case upper bounds for this problem. Specifically, we show an O(nk)-time algorithm and an [Formula presented]-time algorithm. The latter algorithm applies in an extended way a technique that was very recently developed for the k-mismatch problem Bringmann et al. (2019) [10]. A preliminary version of this work appeared at FCT 2019 [35]. In this version we improve the time complexity of the second algorithm from [Formula presented] to [Formula presented]."

In the last decade, the association of GPCRs with cancer has become apparent and offers new opportunities to target GPCRs in oncology. GPCR overexpression and mutations lead to aberrant activation of pro-oncogenic pathways inducing tumor progression. In this review, we describe how GPCRs activate some main signaling pathways that contribute to different cancer hallmarks, including cell transformation, proliferative signaling, immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Thereafter, we highlight different approaches to target GPCRs, including small molecules and biologics (e.g. monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies) and combinatorial (immuno)therapies that are emerging with promising effects for cancer treatment."

The mechanisms underlying long-term coexistence remain unclear as system-wide studies have been largely limited to engineered communities, ex situ adapted cultures or synthetic assemblies. Here, we show how kefir, a natural milk-fermenting community of prokaryotes (predominantly lactic and acetic acid bacteria) and yeasts (family Saccharomycetaceae), realizes stable coexistence through spatiotemporal orchestration of species and metabolite dynamics. During milk fermentation, kefir grains (a polysaccharide matrix synthesized by kefir microorganisms) grow in mass but remain unchanged in composition. In contrast, the milk is colonized in a sequential manner in which early members open the niche for the followers by making available metabolites such as amino acids and lactate. Through metabolomics, transcriptomics and large-scale mapping of inter-species interactions, we show how microorganisms poorly suited for milk survive in\u2014and even dominate\u2014the community, through metabolic cooperation and uneven partitioning between grain and milk. Overall, our findings reveal how inter-species interactions partitioned in space and time lead to stable coexistence."

  "description": "Neurotoxicity and underlying cellular changes of 21 mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitorsInhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (cI) by rotenone and methyl-phenylpyridinium (MPP\u2009+) leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in man and rodents. To formally describe this mechanism of toxicity, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP:3) has been developed that implies that any inhibitor of cI, or possibly of other parts of the respiratory chain, would have the potential to trigger parkinsonian motor deficits. We used here 21 pesticides, all of which are described in the literature as mitochondrial inhibitors, to study the general applicability of AOP:3 or of in vitro assays that are assessing its activation. Five cI, three complex II (cII), and five complex III (cIII) inhibitors were characterized in detail in human dopaminergic neuronal cell cultures. The NeuriTox assay, examining neurite damage in LUHMES cells, was used as in vitro proxy of the adverse outcome (AO), i.e., of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This test provided data on whether test compounds were unspecific cytotoxicants or specifically neurotoxic, and it yielded potency data with respect to neurite degeneration. The pesticide panel was also examined in assays for the sequential key events (KE) leading to the AO, i.e., mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disturbed proteostasis. Data from KE assays were compared to the NeuriTox data (AO). The cII-inhibitory pesticides tested here did not appear to trigger the AOP:3 at all. Some of the cI/cIII inhibitors showed a consistent AOP activation response in all assays, while others did not. In general, there was a clear hierarchy of assay sensitivity: changes of gene expression (biomarker of neuronal stress) correlated well with NeuriTox data; mitochondrial failure (measured both by a mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye and a respirometric assay) was about 10-260 times more sensitive than neurite damage (AO); cI/cIII activity was sometimes affected at\u2009>\u20091000 times lower concentrations than the neurites. These data suggest that the use of AOP:3 for hazard assessment has a number of caveats: (i) specific parkinsonian neurodegeneration cannot be easily predicted from assays of mitochondrial dysfunction; (ii) deriving a point-of-departure for risk assessment from early KE assays may overestimate toxicant potency."

We found that the reaction barrier of the Lewis acid-catalyzed epoxide ring-opening reactions decreases upon ascending in group 1 along the series Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > Li+ > H+. Our activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that the enhanced reactivity of the Lewis acid-catalyzed ring-opening reaction is caused by the reduced steric (Pauli) repulsion between the filled orbitals of the epoxide and the nucleophile, as the Lewis acid polarizes the filled orbitals of the epoxide more efficiently away from the incoming nucleophile. Furthermore, we established that the regioselectivity of these ring-opening reactions is, aside from the \"classical\"strain control, also dictated by a hitherto unknown mechanism, namely, the steric (Pauli) repulsion between the nucleophile and the substrate, which could be traced back to the asymmetric orbital density on the epoxide. In all, this work again demonstrates that the concept of Pauli-lowering catalysis is a general phenomenon. "

  "description": "Intercellular communication induces glycolytic synchronization waves between individually oscillating cellsMany organs have internal structures with spatially differentiated and sometimes temporally synchronized groups of cells. The mechanisms leading to such differentiation and coordination are not well understood. Here we design a diffusion-limited microfluidic system to mimic a multicellular organ structure with peripheral blood flow and test whether a group of individually oscillating yeast cells could form subpopulations of spatially differentiated and temporally synchronized cells. Upon substrate addition, the dynamic response at single-cell level shows glycolytic oscillations, leading to wave fronts traveling through the monolayered population and to synchronized communities at well-defined positions in the cell chamber. A detailed mechanistic model with the architectural structure of the flow chamber incorporated successfully predicts the spatial-temporal experimental data, and allows for a molecular understanding of the observed phenomena. The intricate interplay of intracellular biochemical reaction networks leading to the oscillations, combined with intercellular communication via metabolic intermediates and fluid dynamics of the reaction chamber, is responsible for the generation of the subpopulations of synchronized cells. This mechanism, as analyzed from the model simulations, is experimentally tested using different concentrations of cyanide stress solutions. The results are reproducible and stable, despite cellular heterogeneity, and the spontaneous community development is reminiscent of a zoned cell differentiation often observed in multicellular organs."

Compliance with current regulation and future perspectivesCrumb rubber obtained from scrap tires is greatly employed for the construction of different facilities for sport, recreational and other uses. However, in recent years the concern about their safety and the related adult and children exposure to these surfaces is growing. This study aims a thorough chemical characterization encompassing 42 hazardous compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, adipates, antioxidants and vulcanization agents in a wide range of crumb rubber from different surfaces. For the extraction of the target compounds, a method based on ultrasound-assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UAE-GC\u2013MS/MS) has been validated. Forty crumb rubber samples coming from synthetic turf football pitches, outdoor and indoor playgrounds, urban pavements, commercial tiles and granulates, and scrap tires, were analyzed. In addition, green alternative materials, such as sand and artificial turf based on cork granulate infill were included to compare the levels of the target compounds with those of crumb rubber. Most of the analyzed recycled surfaces meet the recent limits proposed by the European Commission for rubber granulates and mulches, although they exceed in several cases the maximum levels allowed for rubber consumer products. Besides, most of the other target compounds, including several of them considered as endocrine disruptors, were detected in the analyzed samples, reaching parts per million concentrations."

  "description": "Discovery of fragments inducing conformational effects in dynamic proteins using a second-harmonic generation biosensorBiophysical screening of compound libraries for the identification of ligands that interact with a protein is efficient, but does typically not reveal if (or how) ligands may interfere with its functional properties. For this a biochemical/functional assay is required. But for proteins whose function is dependent on a conformational change, such assays are typically complex or have low throughput. Here we have explored a high-throughput second-harmonic generation (SHG) biosensor to detect fragments that induce conformational changes upon binding to a protein in real time and identify dynamic regions. Multiwell plate format SHG assays were developed for wild-type and six engineered single-cysteine mutants of acetyl choline binding protein (AChBP), a homologue to ligand gated ion channels (LGICs). They were conjugated with second harmonic-active labelsviaamine or maleimide coupling. To validate the assay, it was confirmed that the conformational changes induced in AChBP by nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (nAChR) agonists and antagonists were qualitatively different. A 1056 fragment library was subsequently screened against all variants and conformational modulators of AChBP were successfully identified, with hit rates from 9-22%, depending on the AChBP variant. A subset of four hits was selected for orthogonal validation and structural analysis. A time-resolved grating-coupled interferometry-based biosensor assay confirmed the interaction to be a reversible 1-step 1\u2009:\u20091 interaction, and provided estimates of affinities and interaction kinetic rate constants (KD= 0.28-63 \u03bcM,ka= 0.1-6 \u03bcM\u22121s\u22121,kd=1 s\u22121). X-ray crystallography of two of the fragments confirmed their binding at a previously described conformationally dynamic site, corresponding to the regulatory site of LGICs. These results reveal that SHG has the sensitivity to identify fragments that induce conformational changes in a protein. A selection of fragment hits with a response profile different to known LGIC regulators was characterized and confirmed to bind to dynamic regions of the protein."

  "description": "Validating differential volatilome profiles in Parkinson's diseaseParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that does not currently have a robust clinical diagnostic test. Nonmotor symptoms such as skin disorders have long since been associated with the disease, and more recently a characteristic odor emanating from the skin of people with Parkinson's has been identified. Here, dynamic head space (DHS) thermal desorption (TD) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is implemented to directly measure the volatile components of sebum on swabs sampled from people with Parkinson's-both drug na\u00efve and those on PD medications (n = 100) and control subjects (n = 29). Supervised multivariate analyses of data showed 84.4% correct classification of PD cases using all detected volatile compounds. Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores were generated from these data, which revealed eight features with VIP > 1 and p < 0.05 which all presented a downregulation within the control cohorts. Purified standards based on previously annotated analytes of interest eicosane and octadecanal did not match to patient sample data, although multiple metabolite features are annotated with these compounds all with high spectral matches indicating the presence of a series of similar structured species. DHS-TD-GC-MS analysis of a range of lipid standards has revealed the presence of common hydrocarbon species rather than differentiated intact compounds which are hypothesized to be breakdown products of lipids. This replication study validates that a differential volatile profile between control and PD cohorts can be measured using an analytical method that measures volatile compounds directly from skin swabs."

Red mullet (Mullus barbatus) and the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were selected as target species. Concentrations of contaminants in sediment and biota, and contaminant-related biomarkers were analysed. To assess environmental quality in the Cartagena coastal zone with respect to chemical pollution, data were assessed using available assessment criteria, and then integrated for different environmental matrices. A qualitative scoring method was used to rank the overall assessments into selected categories and to evaluate the confidence level of the final integrated assessment. The ICES/OSPAR integrated assessment framework, originally designed for the North Atlantic, was found to be applicable for Mediterranean species and environmental matrices. Further development of assessment criteria of chemical and biological parameters in sediments and target species from the Mediterranean will, however, be required before this framework can be fully applied for determining Good Environmental Status (GES) of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in these regions."

The international ICON workshop (Hylland etal., in this issue) was developed in order to test an integrated approach to assessing both contaminant concentrations and their effects. This paper describes and assesses the concentrations of trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls in sediments, mussels, and fish collected from estuarine, coastal and offshore waters from Iceland to the Mediterranean Sea. For organic contaminants, concentrations progressively increased from Iceland, to the offshore North Sea, to the coastal seas, and were highest in estuaries. Metals had a more complex distribution, reflecting local anthropogenic inputs, natural sources and hydrological conditions. Use of internationally recognised assessment criteria indicated that at no site were concentrations of all contaminants at background and that concentrations of some contaminants were of significant concern in all areas, except the central North Sea."

We show that parameter transferability can be obtained using a systematic approach in which the effects of parameter changes on physico-chemical properties calculated from simulation are predicted. Our previously described QM/MM calculations are used to attribute condensed-phase polarizabilities, and starting from the non-polarizable GROMOS 53A5/53A6 parameter set, van der Waals and Coulomb interaction parameters are optimized to reproduce pure-liquid (thermodynamic, dielectric, and transport) properties, as well as hydration free energies. For a large set of models, which were obtained by combining small perturbations of 10 distinct parameters, values for pure-liquid properties of the series methanol to butanol were close to experiment. From this large set of models, we selected 34 models without special repulsive van der Waals parameters to distinguish between hydrogen-bonding and non-hydrogen-bonding atom pairs, to make the force field simple and transparent."

Expression was independent of HCMV viremia or IgG serostatus. US28 was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and tubular epithelial cells, with a median positivity of 20% and 40%, respectively. Also, US28-positive cells were present within arterial neointima. In contrast to US28, HCMV-encoded immediate early antigen was detected in less than 5% of VSMCs, tubular epithelial cells, interstitial endothelium, interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, and glomerular cells.Primary VSMCs were infected with green fluorescent protein-tagged wild type or US28-deficient HCMV. The viral spreading of US28-deficient HCMV, via culture medium or cell-to-cell transmission, was significantly impeded as shown by green fluorescent protein (ie, infected) cell quantification and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, the number and size of foci was smaller.CONCLUSIONS: In summary, HCMV-encoded US28 was detected in renal allografts from HCMV-positive donors independent of viremia and serostatus. Also, US28 facilitates HCMV spreading in VSMCs in vitro. Because the vasculature is affected in chronic renal transplant dysfunction, US28 may provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention."

ICON has demonstrated the use of a framework for integrated contaminant assessment on European coastal and offshore areas.

  "description": "Characterization of human cytochrome P450 mediated bioactivation of amodiaquine and its major metabolite N-desethylamodiaquineAims: Oxidative bioactivation of amodiaquine (AQ) by cytochrome P450s to a reactive quinoneimine is considered as an important mechanism underlying its idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. However, because internal exposure to its major metabolite N-desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ) is up to 240-fold higher than AQ, bioactivation of DEAQ might significantly contribute to covalent binding. The aim of the present study was to compare the kinetics of bioactivation of AQ and DEAQ by human liver microsomes (HLM) and to characterize the CYPs involved in bioactivation of AQ and DEAQ. Methods: Glutathione was used to trap reactive metabolites formed in incubations of AQ and DEAQ with HLM and recombinant human cytochrome P450s (hCYPs). Kinetics of bioactivation of AQ and DEAQ in HLM and involvement of hCYPs were characterized by measuring corresponding glutathione conjugates (AQ-SG and DEAQ-SG) using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. Results: Bioactivation of AQ and DEAQ in HLM both exhibited Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics. For AQ bioactivation, enzyme kinetical parameters were Km, 11.5\u00b12.0\u03bcmoll\u20131, Vmax, 59.2\u00b13.2pmolmin\u22121mg\u22121 and CLint, 5.15\u03bclmin\u22121mg\u22121. For DEAQ, parameters for bioactivation were Km, 6.1\u00b11.3\u03bcmoll\u20131, Vmax, 5.5\u00b10.4pmolmin\u22121mg\u22121 and CLint 0.90\u03bclmin\u22121mg\u22121. Recombinant hCYPs and inhibition studies with HLM showed involvement of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 in bioactivation. Conclusions: The major metabolite DEAQ is likely to be quantitatively more important than AQ with respect to hepatic exposure to reactive metabolites in vivo. High expression of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 may be risk factors for hepatotoxicity caused by AQ-therapy."

  "description": "Circular spectropolarimetric sensing of chiral photosystems in decaying leavesCircular polarization spectroscopy has proven to be an indispensable tool in photosynthesis research and (bio)molecular research in general. Oxygenic photosystems typically display an asymmetric Cotton effect around the chlorophyll absorbance maximum with a signal \u22641%. In vegetation, these signals are the direct result of the chirality of the supramolecular aggregates. The circular polarization is thus directly influenced by the composition and architecture of the photosynthetic macrodomains, and is thereby linked to photosynthetic functioning. Although ordinarily measured only on a molecular level, we have developed a new spectropolarimetric instrument, TreePol, that allows for both laboratory and in-the-field measurements. Through spectral multiplexing, TreePol is capable of fast measurements with a sensitivity of \u223c1*10\u22124 and is therefore suitable of non-destructively probing the molecular architecture of whole plant leaves. We have measured the chiroptical evolution of Hedera helix leaves for a period of 22 days. Spectrally resolved circular polarization measurements (450-900 nm) on whole leaves in transmission exhibit a strong decrease in the polarization signal over time after plucking, which we accredit to the deterioration of chiral macro-aggregates. Chlorophyll a levels measured over the same period by means of UV\u2013vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy showed a much smaller decrease. With these results we are able to distinguish healthy from deteriorating leaves. Hereby we indicate the potency of circular polarization spectroscopy on whole and intact leaves as a nondestructive tool for structural and plant stress assessment. Additionally, we underline the establishment of circular polarization signals as remotely accessible means of detecting the presence of extraterrestrial life."

  "description": "Generic method for the absolute quantification of glutathione S-conjugates: Application to the conjugates of acetaminophen, clozapine and diclofenacModification of cellular macromolecules by reactive drug metabolites is considered to play an important role in the initiation of tissue injury by many drugs. Detection and identification of reactive intermediates is often performed by analyzing the conjugates formed after trapping by glutathione (GSH). Although sensitivity of modern mass spectrometrical methods is extremely high, absolute quantification of GSH-conjugates is critically dependent on the availability of authentic references. Although 1H NMR is currently the method of choice for quantification of metabolites formed biosynthetically, its intrinsically low sensitivity can be a limiting factor in quantification of GSH-conjugates which generally are formed at low levels. In the present study, a simple but sensitive and generic method for absolute quantification of GSH-conjugates is presented. The method is based on quantitative alkaline hydrolysis of GSH-conjugates and subsequent quantification of glutamic acid and glycine by HPLC after precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde/N-acetylcysteine (OPA/NAC). Because of the lower stability of the glycine OPA/NAC-derivate, quantification of the glutamic acid OPA/NAC-derivate appeared most suitable for quantification of GSH-conjugates. The novel method was used to quantify the concentrations of GSH-conjugates of diclofenac, clozapine and acetaminophen and quantification was consistent with 1H NMR, but with a more than 100-fold lower detection limit for absolute quantification."

  "description": "Model-based quantification of metabolic interactions from dynamic microbial-community dataAn important challenge in microbial ecology is to infer metabolic-exchange fluxes between growing microbial species from community-level data, concerning species abundances and metabolite concentrations. Here we apply a model-based approach to integrate such experimental data and thereby infer metabolic-exchange fluxes. We designed a synthetic anaerobic co-culture of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Wolinella succinogenes that interact via interspecies hydrogen transfer and applied different environmental conditions for which we expected the metabolic-exchange rates to change. We used stoichiometric models of the metabolism of the two microorganisms that represents our current physiological understanding and found that this understanding - the model - is sufficient to infer the identity and magnitude of the metabolic-exchange fluxes and it suggested unexpected interactions. Where the model could not fit all experimental data, it indicates specific requirement for further physiological studies. We show that the nitrogen source influences the rate of interspecies hydrogen transfer in the co-culture. Additionally, the model can predict the intracellular fluxes and optimal metabolic exchange rates, which can point to engineering strategies. This study therefore offers a realistic illustration of the strengths and weaknesses of modelbased integration of heterogenous data that makes inference of metabolic-exchange fluxes possible from community-level experimental data."

  "description": "Continuous fraction collection of gas chromatographic separations with parallel mass spectrometric detection applied to cell-based bioactivity analysisWe describe the development and evaluation of a GC-MS fractionation platform that combines high-resolution fraction collection of full chromatograms with parallel MS detection. A y-split at the column divides the effluent towards the MS detector and towards an inverted y-piece where vaporized trap solvent is infused. The latter flow is directed outside the GC oven allowing subsequent condensation and stepwise collection of liquid fractions with trapped analytes on a 384-well plate. For study and optimization of the effluent split ratio, restriction capillaries of different lengths and diameters were evaluated. For a wide range of settings, local pressures were monitored during fractionation to assess the influence of MS vacuum and trap solvent infusion on the GC system stability. The platform performance was evaluated by GC-MS analysis and continuous fractionation of an n-alkane mixture followed by GC analysis of each fraction. Comparison of the on-line recorded and fraction-reconstructed chromatogram showed the GC separation is maintained during fractionation. Multiple fractionation cycles of the n-alkane sample on the same 384-well plate yielded a reconstructed chromatogram which was highly similar to that of a single analysis, demonstrating the high repeatability. The applicability of the GC-MS-fractionation platform for bioactivity screening was investigated by applying the AR-Ecoscreen reporter gene bioassay on fractions obtained after analysis of standard solutions and dust samples containing the anti-androgenic compounds vinclozolin and p,p\u2019-DDE."

The origin for the occurrence of different aggregation patterns has not yet been investigated. Herein, a quantum chemical study on the different self-assembled structures of guanine and xanthine by using dispersion-corrected DFT is presented. Theoretical investigations can be used to explain, from an electronic point of view, the differences between the experimental findings. With quantitative Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory and the accompanying energy decomposition analysis, the hydrogen-bonding mechanism within the guanine ribbons can be disclosed and the preferred self-assembled structures under different experimental conditions can be explained. An important role of the \u03c3-electronic system in the guanine self-assembled structures is revealed as the main factor for the switch between different arrangements on surfaces and in crystals."

The calculations have been done by means of an excited-state gradient approximation for a pyridine molecule interacting with a silver cluster, and provided a satisfactory improvement in comparison to previous work. The effect of electrode potential on the SERS-CT spectra has been modelled theoretically by applying an external electric field for selected CT transitions and the enhancement of the \u03bd6a and \u03bd9a modes and a decline in the intensity of the \u03bd8a mode under a negative electric field (which is directed toward the cluster) have been observed. These results match well with the experimental studies and also explain the effect of electrode potentials on the patterns of spectra, as experimental evidence of the CT mechanism. Finally, this study demonstrated that the excited state vector gradient can be used as a distinguishing factor to explain the SERS selection rules."

Transfer of molecular C2 symmetry into P2/c packing symmetry provided a connection across length scales to overcome both lack of long-range order and missing diffraction-phase information. Refinement with heteronuclear distance constraints confirmed the racemic P2/c packing that was scaffolded by molecular recognition of salphen zinc in a pseudo-octahedral environment with bromide and with alkyl chains folding along the phenazine. The NDI light-harvesting stacks ran orthogonal to the intermolecular electric dipole moment present in the solid. Finally, the orientation of flexible lamellae on an electrode surface was determined."

  "description": "Recombinant BCG Expressing ESX-1 of Mycobacterium marinum Combines Low Virulence with Cytosolic Immune Signaling and Improved TB ProtectionRecent insights into the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiologic agent ofhuman tuberculosis, is recognized by cytosolic nucleotide sensors have opened new avenues for rational vaccine design. The only licensed anti-tuberculosis vaccine, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, provides limited protection. A feature of BCG is the partial deletion of the ESX-1 type VII secretion system, which governs phagosomal rupture and cytosolic pattern recognition, key intracellular phenotypes linked to increased immune signaling. Here, by heterologously expressing the esx-1 region of Mycobacterium marinum in BCG, we engineered a low-virulence, ESX-1-proficient, recombinant BCG (BCG::ESX-1Mmar) that induces the cGas/STING/TBK1/IRF-3/type I interferon axis and enhances AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasome activity, resulting in both higher proportions of CD8+ Tcell effectors against mycobacterial antigens shared with BCG and polyfunctional CD4+ Th1 cells specific to ESX-1 antigens. Importantly, independent mouse vaccination models show that BCG::ESX-1Mmar confers superior protection relative to parental BCG against challenges with highly virulent M.tuberculosis."

The f-Block ElementsThe f-block elements are addressed in this third part of a series of prolapse-free basis sets of quadruple-\u03b6 quality (RPF-4Z). Relativistic adapted Gaussian basis sets (RAGBSs) are used as primitive sets of functions while correlating/polarization (C/P) functions are chosen by analyzing energy lowerings upon basis set increments in Dirac-Coulomb multireference configuration interaction calculations with single and double excitations of the valence spinors. These function exponents are obtained by applying the RAGBS parameters in a polynomial expression. Moreover, through the choice of C/P characteristic exponents from functions of lower angular momentum spaces, a reduction in the computational demand is attained in relativistic calculations based on the kinetic balance condition. The present study thus complements the RPF-4Z sets for the whole periodic table (Z \u2264 118).

  "description": "The effect of acetaminophen on ubiquitin homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeAcetaminophen (APAP), although considered a safe drug, is one of the major causes of acute liver failure by overdose, and therapeutic chronic use can cause serious health problems. Although the reactive APAP metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI) is clearly linked to liver toxicity, toxicity of APAP is also found without drug metabolism of APAP to NAPQI. To get more insight into mechanisms of APAP toxicity, a genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for APAP-resistant deletion strains was performed. In this screen we identified genes related to the DNA damage response. Next, we investigated the link between genotype and APAP-induced toxicity or resistance by performing a more detailed screen with a library containing mutants of 1522 genes related to nuclear processes, like DNA repair and chromatin remodelling. We identified 233 strains that had an altered growth rate relative to wild type, of which 107 showed increased resistance to APAP and 126 showed increased sensitivity. Gene Ontology analysis identified ubiquitin homeostasis, regulation of transcription of RNA polymerase II genes, and the mitochondria-to-nucleus signalling pathway to be associated with APAP resistance, while histone exchange and modification, and vesicular transport were connected to APAP sensitivity. Indeed, we observed a link between ubiquitin levels and APAP resistance, whereby ubiquitin deficiency conferred resistance to APAP toxicity while ubiquitin overexpression resulted in sensitivity. The toxicity profile of various chemicals, APAP, and its positional isomer AMAP on a series of deletion strains with ubiquitin deficiency showed a unique resistance pattern for APAP. Furthermore, exposure to APAP increased the level of free ubiquitin and influenced the ubiquitination of proteins. Together, these results uncover a role for ubiquitin homeostasis in APAP-induced toxicity."

  "description": "Case Study on Screening Emerging Pollutants in Urine and NailsAlternative plasticizers and flame retardants (FRs) have been introduced as replacements for banned or restricted chemicals, but much is still unknown about their metabolism and occurrence in humans. We identified the metabolites formed in vitro for four alternative plasticizers (acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC), bis(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP), bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (DEHA)), and one FR (2,2-bis (chloromethyl)-propane-1,3-diyltetrakis(2-chloroethyl) bisphosphate (V6)). Further, these compounds and their metabolites were investigated by LC/ESI-Orbitrap-MS in urine and finger nails collected from a Norwegian cohort. Primary and secondary ATBC metabolites had detection frequencies (% DF) in finger nails ranging from 46 to 95%. V6 was identified for the first time in finger nails, suggesting that this matrix may also indicate past exposure to FRs as well as alternative plasticizers. Two isomeric forms of DEHTP primary metabolite were highly detected in urine (97% DF) and identified in finger nails, while no DPHP metabolites were detected in vivo. Primary and secondary DEHA metabolites were identified in both matrices, and the relative proportion of the secondary metabolites was higher in urine than in finger nails; the opposite was observed for the primary metabolites. As many of the metabolites present in in vitro extracts were further identified in vivo in urine and finger nail samples, this suggests that in vitro assays can reliably mimic the in vivo processes. Finger nails may be a useful noninvasive matrix for human biomonitoring of specific organic contaminants, but further validation is needed."

  "description": "Application of an E. coli signal sequence as a versatile inclusion body tagBackground: Heterologous protein production in Escherichia coli often suffers from bottlenecks such as proteolytic degradation, complex purification procedures and toxicity towards the expression host. Production of proteins in an insoluble form in inclusion bodies (IBs) can alleviate these problems. Unfortunately, the propensity of heterologous proteins to form IBs is variable and difficult to predict. Hence, fusing the target protein to an aggregation prone polypeptide or IB-tag is a useful strategy to produce difficult-to-express proteins in an insoluble form. Results: When screening for signal sequences that mediate optimal targeting of heterologous proteins to the periplasmic space of E. coli, we observed that fusion to the 39 amino acid signal sequence of E. coli TorA (ssTorA) did not promote targeting but rather directed high-level expression of the human proteins hEGF, Pla2 and IL-3 in IBs. Further analysis revealed that ssTorA even mediated IB formation of the highly soluble endogenous E. coli proteins TrxA and MBP. The ssTorA also induced aggregation when fused to the C-terminus of target proteins and appeared functional as IB-tag in E. coli K-12 as well as B strains. An additive effect on IB-formation was observed upon fusion of multiple ssTorA sequences in tandem, provoking almost complete aggregation of TrxA and MBP. The ssTorA-moiety was successfully used to produce the intrinsically unstable hEGF and the toxic fusion partner SymE, demonstrating its applicability as an IB-tag for difficult-to-express and toxic proteins. Conclusions: We present proof-of-concept for the use of ssTorA as a small, versatile tag for robust E. coli-based expression of heterologous proteins in IBs."

  "description": "Plant cysteine oxidases are dioxygenases that directly enable arginyl transferase-catalysed arginylation of N-end rule targetsCrop yield loss due to flooding is a threat to food security. Submergence-induced hypoxia in plants results in stabilization of group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORs (ERF-VIIs), which aid survival under these adverse conditions. ERF-VII stability is controlled by the N-end rule pathway, which proposes that ERF-VII N-terminal cysteine oxidation in normoxia enables arginylation followed by proteasomal degradation. The PLANT CYSTEINE OXIDASEs (PCOs) have been identified as catalysts of this oxidation. ERF-VII stabilization in hypoxia presumably arises from reduced PCO activity. We directly demonstrate that PCO dioxygenase activity produces Cys-sulfinic acid at the N terminus of an ERF-VII peptide, which then undergoes efficient arginylation by an arginyl transferase (ATE1). This provides molecular evidence of N-terminal Cys-sulfinic acid formation and arginylation by N-end rule pathway components, and a substrate of ATE1 in plants. The PCOs and ATE1 may be viable intervention targets to stabilize N-end rule substrates, including ERF-VIIs, to enhance submergence tolerance in agriculture."

  "description": "Both intrinsic substrate preference and network context contribute to substrate selection of classical tyrosine phosphatasesReversible tyrosine phosphorylation is a widespread posttranslational modification mechanism underlying cell physiology. Thus, understanding the mechanisms responsible for substrate selection by kinases and phosphatases is central to our ability to model signal transduction at a system level. Classical protein-tyrosine phosphatases can exhibit substrate specificity in vivo by combining intrinsic enzymatic specificity with the network of protein-protein interactions, which positions the enzymes in close proximity to their substrates. Here we use a high throughput approach, based on high density phosphopeptide chips, to determine the in vitro substrate preference of 16 members of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase family. This approach helped identify one residue in the substrate binding pocket of the phosphatase domain that confers specificity for phosphopeptides in a specific sequence context. We also present a Bayesian model that combines intrinsic enzymatic specificity and interaction information in the context of the human protein interaction network to infer new phosphatase substrates at the proteome level."

  "description": "Using numerical model simulations to improve the understanding of micro-plastic distribution and pathways in the marine environmentNumerical modeling is one of the key tools with which we can gain insight into the distribution of marine litter, especially micro-plastics. Over the past decade, a series of numerical simulations have been constructed that specifically target floating marine litter, based on ocean models of various complexity. Some of these models include the effects of currents, waves, and wind as well as a series of processes that impact how particles interact with ocean currents, including fragmentation and degradation. Here, we give an overview of these models, including their spatial and temporal resolution, limitations, availability, and what we have learned from them. Then we focus on floating marine micro-plastics (< 5 mm diameter) and we make recommendations for experimental research efforts that can improve the skill of the models by increasing our understanding of the processes that govern the dispersion of marine litter. In addition, we highlight the importance of knowing accurately the sources or entry points of marine plastic debris, including potential sources that have not been incorporated in previous studies (e.g., atmospheric contributions). Finally, we identify information gaps and priority work areas for research. We also highlight the need for appreciating and acknowledging the uncertainty that persists regarding the movement, transportation and accumulation of anthropogenic litter in the marine environment."

  "description": "Drug toxicity profiling of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae deubiquitinase deletion panel shows that acetaminophen mimics tyrosinePost-translational protein modification by addition or removal of the small polypeptide ubiquitin is involved in a range of critical cellular processes, like proteasomal protein degradation, DNA repair, gene expression, internalization of membrane proteins, and drug sensitivity. We recently identified genes important for acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity in a comprehensive screen and our findings suggested that a small set of yeast strains carrying deletions of ubiquitin-related genes can be informative for drug toxicity profiling. In yeast, approximately 20 different deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) have been identified, of which only one is essential for viability. We investigated whether the toxicity profile of DUB deletion yeast strains would be informative about the toxicological mode of action of APAP. A set of DUB deletion strains was tested for sensitivity and resistance to a diverse series of compounds, including APAP, quinine, ibuprofen, rapamycin, cycloheximide, cadmium, peroxide and amino acids and a cluster analysis was performed. Most DUB deletion strains showed an altered growth pattern when exposed to these compounds by being either more sensitive or more resistant than WT. Toxicity profiling of the DUB strains revealed a remarkable overlap between the amino acid tyrosine and acetaminophen (APAP), but not its stereoisomer AMAP. Furthermore, co-exposure of cells to both APAP and tyrosine showed an enhancement of the cellular growth inhibition, suggesting that APAP and tyrosine have a similar mode of action."

  "description": "Nanofractionation Platform with Parallel Mass Spectrometry for Identification of CYP1A2 Inhibitors in Metabolic MixturesWith early assessment of inhibitory properties of drug candidates and their circulating metabolites toward cytochrome P450 enzymes, drug attrition, especially later in the drug development process, can be decreased. Here we describe the development and validation of an at-line nanofractionation platform, which was applied for screening of CYP1A2 inhibitors in Phase I metabolic mixtures. With this platform, a metabolic mixture is separated by liquid chromatography (LC), followed by parallel nanofractionation on a microtiter well plate and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. After solvent evaporation, all metabolites present in the nanofractionated mixture are assayed utilizing a fluorescence CYP1A2 inhibition bioassay performed on the plate. Next, a bioactivity chromatogram is constructed from the bioassay results. By peak shape and retention time correlation of the bioactivity peaks with the obtained MS data, CYP1A2-bioactive inhibiting metabolites can be identified. The method correctly evaluated the potency of five CYP1A2 inhibitors. Mixtures comprising potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 or in vitro\u2013generated metabolites of ellipticine were evaluated for their inhibitory bioactivities. In both cases, good LC separation of all compounds was achieved and bioactivity data could be accurately correlated with the parallel recorded MS data. Generation and evaluation of Phase II metabolites of hydroxylated ellipticine was also pursued."

  "description": "Presence of diphenyl phosphate and aryl-phosphate flame retardants in indoor dust from different microenvironments in Spain and the Netherlands and estimation of human exposurePhosphate flame retardants (PFRs) are ubiquitous chemicals in the indoor environment. Diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) is a major metabolite and a common biomarker of aryl-PFRs. Since it is used as a chemical additive and it is a common impurity of aryl-PFRs as well as a degradation product, its presence in indoor dust as an additional source of exposure should not be easily ruled out. In this study, DPHP (and TPHP) are measured in indoor dust in samples collected in Spain and in the Netherlands (n = 80). Additionally, the presence of other emerging aryl-PFRs was monitored by target screening. TPHP and DPHP were present in all samples in the ranges 169\u2013142,459 ng/g and 106\u201379,661 ng/g, respectively. DPHP concentrations were strongly correlated to the TPHP levels (r = 0.90, p < 0.01), suggesting that DPHP could be present as degradation product of TPHP or other aryl-PFRs. Estimated exposures for adults and toddlers in Spain to TPHP and DPHP via dust ingestion (country for which the number of samples was higher) were much lower than the estimated reference dose (US EPA) for TPHP. However, other routes of exposure may contribute to the overall internal exposure (diet, dermal contact with dust/consumer products and inhalation of indoor air). The estimated urinary DPHP levels for adults and toddlers in Spain (0.002\u20130.032 ng/mL) as a result of dust ingestion were low in comparison with the reported levels, indicating a low contribution of this source of contamination to the overall DPHP exposure. Other aryl-PFRs, namely cresyl diphenyl phosphate (CDP), resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) (RDP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EDPHP), isodecyl diphenyl phosphate (IDP) and bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate) (BDP), were all detected in indoor dust, however, with lower frequency."

  "description": "Promising prebiotic candidate established by evaluation of lactitol, lactulose, raffinose, and oligofructose for maintenance of a Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiotaPerturbations to the vaginal microbiota can lead to dysbiosis, including bacterial vaginosis (BV), which affects a large portion of the female population. In a healthy state, the vaginal microbiota is characterized by low diversity and colonization by Lactobacillus spp., whereas in BV, these species are displaced by a highly diverse population of bacteria associated with adverse vaginal health outcomes. Since prebiotic ingestion has been a highly effective approach to invigorate lactobacilli for improved intestinal health, we hypothesized that these compounds could stimulate lactobacilli at the expense of BV organisms to maintain vaginal health. Monocultures of commensal Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus vaginalis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus jensenii, and Lactobacillus iners, in addition to BV-associated organisms and Candida albicans, were tested for their ability to utilize a representative group of prebiotics consisting of lactitol, lactulose, raffinose, and oligofructose. The disaccharide lactulose was found to most broadly and specifically stimulate vaginal lactobacilli, including the strongly health-associated species L. crispatus, and importantly, not to stimulate BV organisms or C. albicans. Using freshly collected vaginal samples, we showed that exposure to lactulose promoted commensal Lactobacillus growth and dominance and resulted in healthy acidity partially through lactic acid production. This provides support for further testing of lactulose to prevent dysbiosis and potentially to reduce the need for antimicrobial agents in managing vaginal health."

  "description": "Effect of UGT2B7*2 and CYP2C8*4 polymorphisms on diclofenac metabolismThe use of diclofenac is associated with rare but severe drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in a very small number of patients. The factors which predispose susceptible patients to hepatotoxicity of diclofenac are still incompletely understood. Formation of protein-reactive metabolites by UDP-glucuronosyl transferases and cytochromes P450 is commonly considered to play an important role, as indicated by the detection of covalent protein adducts and antibodies in the serum of patients suffering from diclofenac-induced liver injury. Since no associations have been found with HLA-alleles, polymorphisms of genes encoding for proteins involved in the disposition of diclofenac may be important. Previous association studies showed that possession of the UGT2B7*2 and CYP2C8*4 alleles is more common in cases of diclofenac-induced DILI. In the present study, the metabolism of diclofenac by UGT2B7*2 and CYP2C8*4 was compared with their corresponding wild-type enzymes. Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that recombinant UGT2B7*2 showed an almost 6-fold lower intrinsic clearance of diclofenac glucuronidation compared to UGT2B7*1. The mutant CYP2C8*4 showed approximately 35% reduced activity in the 4\u2032-hydroxylation of diclofenac acyl glucuronide. Therefore, a decreased hepatic exposure to diclofenac acyl glucuronide is expected in patients with the UGT2B7*2 genotype. The increased risk for hepatotoxicity, therefore, might be the result from a shift to oxidative bioactivation to cytotoxic quinoneimines."

  "description": "Theoretical Investigations on the Mechanistic Aspects of O2 Activation by a Biomimetic Dinitrosyl Iron ComplexThough dinitrosyl-iron complexes (DNICs) are largely believed to act as NO carriers, several experiments on model DNICs have suggested that they can also act as nitrating agents in presence of dioxygen. Oxygen activation by DNICs has been implicated as a possible route for protein tyrosine nitration (PTN), which leads to neurodegenerative disorders. Herein using static and dynamic theoretical techniques we unravel a previously unknown dual state mechanistic paradigm for dioxygen activation of a biomimetic nitrating DNIC complex leading to phenolic nitration. Our computations reveal that the model DNIC, the ground electronic state of which is singlet, has a low-lying triplet state and an inherent singlet\u2013triplet spin-crossover of DNICs can be triggered by fluxional changes in the bite angle of the two NO ligands. The presence of a low-lying triplet state in the DNIC affords an avenue for O2 activation other than a direct O2 activation by O2-induced spin-crossover of the singlet ground state. These two low-lying channels facilitate the formation of a peroxynitrite species. Nitration of phenolic substrates is facilitated by the release of NO2. The corresponding minimum energy crossing points (MECP) have been located. Along the reaction path, the changes in the electronic structure scenarios have been studied and interpreted. Our report also sheds light on the plausible mechanistic pathway of PTN by reactive species formed once O2 activation by DNICs have been achieved."

  "description": "Quantifying exosome secretion from single cells reveals a modulatory role for GPCR signalingExosomes are small endosome-derived extracellular vesicles implicated in cell-cell communication and are secreted by living cells when multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fuse with the plasma membrane (PM). Current techniques to study exosome physiology are based on isolation procedures after secretion, precluding direct and dynamic insight into the mechanics of exosome biogenesis and the regulation of their release. In this study, we propose real-time visualization of MVB-PM fusion to overcome these limitations. We designed tetraspanin-based pH-sensitive optical reporters that detect MVB-PM fusion using live total internal reflection fluorescence and dynamic correlative light-electron microscopy. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that MVB-PM fusion frequency is reduced by depleting the target membrane SNA REs SNAP23 and syntaxin-4 but also can be induced in single cells by stimulation of the histamine H1 receptor (H1HR). Interestingly, activation of H1R1 in HeLa cells increases Ser110 phosphorylation of SNAP23, promoting MVB-PM fusion and the release of CD63-enriched exosomes. Using this single-cell resolution approach, we highlight the modulatory dynamics of MVB exocytosis that will help to increase our understanding of exosome physiology and identify druggable targets in exosome-associated pathologies."

The general applicability of the approach underlines its usefulness for structurally flexible chiral systems, a situation that is more the rule rather than the exception."

The existence of hybridization in the bonding between closed shell d10-d10 metal atoms has also been speculated, but the presence of attractive MO interaction in the metal-metal bond is still a matter of an ongoing debate. In this comparative study, a quantitative molecular orbital analysis and energy decomposition is carried out on the metallophilic interaction in atomic dimers (M+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7M+) and molecular perpendicular [H3P-M-X]2 (where M = Cu, Ag, and Au; X = F, Cl, Br, and I). Our computational studies prove that besides the commonly accepted dispersive interactions, orbital interactions and Pauli repulsion also play a crucial role in the strength and length of the metal-metal bond. Although for M+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7M+ the orbital interaction is larger than the Pauli repulsion, leading to a net attractive MO interaction, the bonding mechanism in perpendicular [H3P-M-X] dimers is different due to the larger separation between the donor and acceptor orbitals. Thus, Pauli repulsion is much larger, and two-orbital, four-electron repulsion is dominant."

To address this issue, herein, we propose a new ligand capping strategy utilizing common and inexpensive long-chain zwitterionic molecules such as 3-(N,N-dimethyloctadecylammonio)propanesulfonate, resulting in much improved chemical durability. In particular, this class of ligands allows for the isolation of clean NCs with high photoluminescence quantum yields (PL QYs) of above 90% after four rounds of precipitation/redispersion along with much higher overall reaction yields of uniform and colloidal dispersible NCs. Densely packed films of these NCs exhibit high PL QY values and effective charge transport. Consequently, they exhibit photoconductivity and low thresholds for amplified spontaneous emission of 2 \u03bcJ cm-2 under femtosecond optical excitation and are suited for efficient light-emitting diodes."

  "description": "The interaction between network ties and business modeling: Case studies of sustainability-oriented innovationsA stream of literature is emerging where network development and business modeling intersect. Various authors emphasize that networks influence business models. This paper extends this stream of literature by studying two cases in which we analyze how business modeling and networking interact over time. We propose the concept \u2018value shaping\u2019 to describe this interaction. Value shaping refers to the mutually constitutive process in which on the one hand networking helps to refine and improve the overall business model and on the other hand an improved business model spurs expansion of the network. We identify five micro-level processes through which value shaping occurs. Value shaping is particularly relevant for sustainability-oriented innovations, to help clarify all the types of financial, social and environmental value to which a business model may contribute."

  "description": "Four-Component Polarization Propagator Calculations of Electron Excitations: Spectroscopic Implications of Spin-Orbit Coupling EffectsA complete implementation of the polarization propagator based on the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is presented and applied to excitation spectra of various systems. Hereby the effect of spin-orbit coupling on excitation energies and transition moments is investigated in detail. The individual perturbational contributions to the transition moments could now be separately analyzed for the first time and show the relevance of one- and two-particle terms. In some systems different contributions to the transition moments partially cancel each other and do not allow for simple predictions. For the outer valence spectrum of the H2Os(CO)4 complex a detailed final state analysis is performed explaining the sensitivity of the excitation spectrum to spin-orbit effects. Finally, technical issues of handling double group symmetry in the relativistic framework and methodological aspects of our parallel implementation are discussed."

  "description": "A benzene-degrading nitrate-reducing microbial consortium displays aerobic and anaerobic benzene degradation pathwaysIn this study, we report transcription of genes involved in aerobic and anaerobic benzene degradation pathways in a benzene-degrading denitrifying continuous culture. Transcripts associated with the family Peptococcaceae dominated all samples (21-36% relative abundance) indicating their key role in the community. We found a highly transcribed gene cluster encoding a presumed anaerobic benzene carboxylase (AbcA and AbcD) and a benzoate-coenzyme A ligase (BzlA). Predicted gene products showed >96% amino acid identity and similar gene order to the corresponding benzene degradation gene cluster described previously, providing further evidence for anaerobic benzene activation via carboxylation. For subsequent benzoyl-CoA dearomatization, bam-like genes analogous to the ones found in other strict anaerobes were transcribed, whereas gene transcripts involved in downstream benzoyl-CoA degradation were mostly analogous to the ones described in facultative anaerobes. The concurrent transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in oxygenase-mediated aerobic benzene degradation suggested oxygen presence in the culture, possibly formed via a recently identified nitric oxide dismutase (Nod). Although we were unable to detect transcription of Nod-encoding genes, addition of nitrite and formate to the continuous culture showed indication for oxygen production. Such an oxygen production would enable aerobic microbes to thrive in oxygen-depleted and nitrate-containing subsurface environments contaminated with hydrocarbons."

  "description": "A non-JKL density matrix functional for intergeminal correlation between closed-shell geminals from analysis of natural orbital configuration interaction expansionsAlmost all functionals that are currently used in density matrix functional theory have been created by some a priori ansatz that generates approximations to the second-order reduced density matrix (2RDM). In this paper, a more consistent approach is used: we analyze the 2RDMs (in the natural orbital basis) of rather accurate multi-reference configuration interaction expansions for several small molecules (CH4, NH3, H2O, FH, and N2) and use the knowledge gained to generate new functionals. The analysis shows that a geminal-like structure is present in the 2RDMs, even though no geminal theory has been applied from the onset. It is also shown that the leading non-geminal dynamical correlation contributions are generated by a specific set of double excitations. The corresponding determinants give rise to non-JKL (non Coulomb/Exchange like) multipole-multipole dispersive attractive terms between geminals. Due to the proximity of the geminals, these dispersion terms are large and cannot be omitted, proving pure JKL functionals to be essentially deficient. A second correction emerges from the observation that the \"normal\" geminal-like exchange between geminals breaks down when one breaks multiple bonds. This problem can be fixed by doubling the exchange between bond broken geminals, effectively restoring the often physically correct high-spin configurations on the bond broken fragments. Both of these corrections have been added to the commonly used antisymmetrized product of strongly orthogonal geminals functional. The resulting non-JKL functional Extended L\u00f6wdin-Shull Dynamical-Multibond is capable of reproducing complete active space self-consistent field curves, in which one active orbital is used for each valence electron."

  "description": "Oxygen Activation and Energy Conservation by Cytochrome c OxidaseThis review focuses on the type A cytochrome c oxidases (CcO), which are found in all mitochondria and also in several aerobic bacteria. CcO catalyzes the respiratory reduction of dioxygen (O2) to water by an intriguing mechanism, the details of which are fairly well understood today as a result of research for over four decades. Perhaps even more intriguingly, the membrane-bound CcO couples the O2 reduction chemistry to translocation of protons across the membrane, thus contributing to generation of the electrochemical proton gradient that is used to drive the synthesis of ATP as catalyzed by the rotary ATP synthase in the same membrane. After reviewing the structure of the core subunits of CcO, the active site, and the transfer paths of electrons, protons, oxygen, and water, we describe the states of the catalytic cycle and point out the few remaining uncertainties. Finally, we discuss the mechanism of proton translocation and the controversies in that area that still prevail."

  "description": "Organophosphate triesters and selected metabolites enhance binding of thyroxine to human transthyretin in vitroThe toxicological properties of organophosphate (OP) triesters that are used as flame retardants and plasticizers are currently not well understood, though increasing evidence suggests they can affect the thyroid system. Perturbation of thyroid hormone (TH) transport is one mechanism of action that may affect thyroid function. The present study applied an in vitro competitive protein binding assay with thyroxine (T4) and human transthyretin (hTTR) transport protein to determine the potential for the OP triesters, TDCIPP (tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate), TBOEP (tris(butoxyethyl) phosphate), TEP (triethyl phosphate), TPHP (triphenyl phosphate), p-OH-TPHP (para-hydroxy triphenyl phosphate), and the OP diester DPHP (diphenyl phosphate), to competitively displace T4 from hTTR. Enhancement of T4 binding to hTTR, rather than the hypothesized competition, was observed for the six OP esters and in a concentration-dependent manner. For example, T4-hTTR binding was significantly increased at concentrations of TBOEP as low as 64 nM, and up to 184% of controls at 5000 nM. A plausible explanation of these results, which to our knowledge has not been previously reported, may be allosteric interactions of the OP esters with hTTR allowing T4 to access the second site of the TH binding pocket. These in vitro results suggest a novel mechanism of OP ester toxicity via T4 binding enhancement, and possible dysregulation of T4-hTTR interactions."

When cyclopropenone is the dienophile, there is a 1.8 kcal/mol preference for the exo cycloaddition with butadiene, while the reaction of 3-difluoromethylene triafulvene with butadiene favors the endo cycloaddition by 2.8 kcal/mol. The influence of charge transfer and secondary orbital interactions on the stereoselectivity of Diels-Alder reactions involving triafulvenes and heteroanalogs is discussed. The predicted stereoselectivity correlates with both the charge and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) coefficient at the C3 carbon of the triafulvene motif."

The Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) describes what procedures the models are subjected to, and the details of those procedures.

The Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) is an XML-based format that encodes, for a given simulation experiment, (i) which models to use; (ii) which modifications to apply to models before simulation; (iii) which simulation procedures to run on each model; (iv) how to post-process the data; and (v) how these results should be plotted and reported. SED-ML Level 1 Version 1 (L1V1) implemented support for the encoding of basic time course simulations. SED-ML L1V2 added support for more complex types of simulations, specifically repeated tasks and chained simulation procedures.

In particular, the double CH activation of bismuth-bound diphenyl amide, (NPh2)\u2212, is reported along with simple one-pot procedures for the functionalization of the activated positions. The organometallic products of the first and second CH activation steps were isolated in high yields.

Photopharmacology uses photons to control in situ the biological properties of photoswitchable small-molecule ligands, which bodes well for chemical biological precision approaches. Integrating the light-switchable configurational properties of an azobenzene into the ligand core, we developed a bidirectional antagonist toolbox for an archetypical family A GPCR, the histamine H3 receptor (H3R). From 16 newly synthesized photoswitchable compounds, VUF14738 (28) and VUF14862 (33) were selected as they swiftly and reversibly photoisomerize and show over 10-fold increased or decreased H3R binding affinities, respectively, upon illumination at 360 nm. Both ligands combine long thermal half-lives with fast and high photochemical trans-/cis conversion, allowing their use in real-time electrophysiology experiments with oocytes to confirm dynamic photomodulation of H3R activation in repeated second-scale cycles. VUF14738 and VUF14862 are robust and fatigue-resistant photoswitchable GPCR antagonists suitable for spatiotemporal studies of H3R signaling."

We find that the host-guest interaction can be enhanced through the introduction of strongly electron-withdrawing groups at particular positions of the arene and triazine units in the host molecule as well as by coordination of a metal complex to the arene and triazine rings. Our analyses reveal that the enhanced anion affinity is caused by increasing the electrostatic potential in the heterocalixarene cavities. This insight can be employed to further tune and improve their selectivity for chloride ions."

  "description": "Investigating predictive tools for refinery effluent hazard assessment using stream mesocosmsHazard assessment of refinery effluents is challenging because of their compositional complexity. Therefore, a weight-of-evidence approach using a combination of tools is often required. Previous research has focused on several predictive tools for sophisticated chemical analyses: biomimetic extraction to quantify the potentially bioaccumulative substances, 2-dimensional gas chromatography, modeling approaches to link oil composition to toxicity (PETROTOX), and whole-effluent toxicity assessments using bioassays. The present study investigated the value of these tools by comparing predicted effects to actual effects observed in stream mesocosm toxicity studies with refinery effluents. Three different effluent samples, with and without fortification by neat petroleum substances, were tested in experimental freshwater streams. The results indicate that the biological community shifted at higher exposure levels, consistent with chronic toxicity effects predicted by both modeled toxic units and potentially bioaccumulative substance measurements. The present study has demonstrated the potential of the predictive tools and the robustness of the stream mesocosm design to improve our understanding of the environmental hazards posed by refinery effluents.

  "description": "Design and evaluation of a multiplexed angular-scanning surface plasmon resonance system employing line-laser optics and CCD detection in combination with multi-ligand sensor chipsAn angle-scanning Kretschmann configuration SPR instrument allowing multiplexed analysis is presented. Laser light was guided through optics that converted the collimated light into a line-shaped beam, which was directed to a prism, illuminating the gold sensor surface over a 1 \u00d7 10 mm area. The reflected light was led to a CCD detector providing simultaneous readout of individual analysis spots along the laser line at a selected angle (fixed-angle detection) or in scanning-angle mode (width of 35\u00b0). Full SPR curve could be measured every 3.6 s for each illuminated spot on the sensor surface. Two in-house manufactured flow cell designs were used for evaluating multiplexed angular-scanning SPR. The first comprised six parallel channels with the laser line perpendicular to the flow direction in order to allow interrogation of the sensor surface in the six channels. Refractive index changes by varying solution composition, and adsorption of different concentrations of albumin to the sensor surface could be correctly monitored simultaneously in each of the channels. In the second flow-cell design the laser line was coinciding with the flow path, allowing recording of SPR curves along a 10-mm length of the sensor surface. Adsorption of layers of positively and negatively charged polyelectrolytes could be consistently measured for sixteen selected positions along the channel. As a proof of principle, several target proteins were immobilized on different positions along the sensor and the binding of various antibodies with these proteins was monitored simultaneously, showing excellent selectivity and reproducibility for probing antibody-protein interactions in a multiplexed fashion."

Complementing and extending prior studies, we theorize and examine how two critical contextual factors (supervisor support for creativity [SSC] and job characteristics) effectively activate PsyCap associated with self-reported employee creativity. Drawing on an interactional perspective, we use trait activation theory to examine the moderating effects of SSC and job characteristics on the relationship between PsyCap and self-reported employee creativity. Through rigorous hypotheses testing (N=356 individuals from multiple industries in Chinese firms), our results demonstrate that both SSC and job characteristics positively moderate the PsyCap\u2013creativity relationship. Additional analyses reveal that PsyCap is most effective at enhancing creativity when both SSC and job characteristics are high. Implications of these findings for theory, future research and practice are discussed."

The SLB PAHms column allowed separation of most isomers. The SLB\u00ae-ILPAH column showed a rather different retention pattern compared to the other two columns and, therefore, provided a potential for use in comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC\u00d7GC).

  "description": "Optimization of secretion and surface localization of heterologous OVA protein in mycobacteria by using LipY as a carrier 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1107 ImmunologyBackground: Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) is not only used as a vaccine against tuberculosis but also protects against leprosy and is used as part of bladder cancer treatment to induce a protective immune response. However, protection by BCG vaccination is not optimal. To improve vaccine efficacy, recombinant BCG expressing heterologous antigens has been put forward to elicit antigen-specific cellular and humoral responses. Cell surface localized or secreted antigens induce better immune responses than their cytosolic counterparts. Optimizing secretion of heterologous proteins or protein fragments holds therefore unexplored potential for improving the efficacy of recombinant BCG vaccine candidates. Secretion of heterologous antigens requires crossing the mycobacterial inner and outer membrane. Mycobacteria have specialized ESX or type VII secretion systems that enable translocation of proteins across both membranes. Probing this secretion system could therefore be a valid approach to surface localize heterologous antigens. Results: We show that ESX-5 substrate LipY, a lipase, can be used as a carrier for heterologous secretion of an ovalbumin fragment (OVA). LipY contains a PE domain and a lipase domain, separated by a linker region. This linker domain is processed upon secretion. Fusion of the PE and linker domains of LipY to OVA enabled ESX-5-dependent secretion of the fusion construct LipY-OVA in M. marinum, albeit with low efficiency. Subsequent random mutagenesis of LipY-OVA and screening for increased secretion resulted in mutants with improved heterologous secretion. Detailed analysis identified two mutations in OVA that improved secretion, i.e. an L280P mutation and a protein-extending frameshift mutation. Finally, deletion of the linker domain of LipY enhanced secretion of LipY-OVA, although this mutation also reduced surface association. Further analysis in wild type LipY showed that the linker domain is required for surface association. Conclusion: We show that the ESX-5 system can be used for heterologous secretion. Furthermore, minor mutations in the substrate can enhance secretion. Especially the C-terminal region seems to be important for this. The linker domain of LipY is involved in surface association. These findings show that non-biased screening approaches aid in optimization of heterologous secretion, which can contribute to heterologous vaccine development."

  "description": "Closed-open innovation strategy for autonomous vehicle developmentThe automobile industry is faced with societal and market pressures to develop radically innovative cars for the future. The development of the autonomous vehicle (AV) is a strategic innovation in this area. This paper studies whether and how AV-innovation strategies at Tesla, BMW and Toyota are developed by using an open and/or closed innovation paradigm. More than ever, it appears that R&D departments of car manufacturers employ a combination of a closed and an open innovation strategy. In order to nurture their AV innovation strategy, they strategically decide which innovations to adopt from outside, and which parts of the R&D process to keep in-house. This paper presents and discusses the combined closed-open AV-innovation strategies used by three dominant car producers. It provides an insight in how they aim to gain a first-to-market position and sustainable competitive advantage in a new market segment of a highly saturated market."

  "description": "The number of active metabolic pathways is bounded by the number of cellular constraints at maximal metabolic ratesGrowth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized-in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints-we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space."

  "description": "Effects of 25 thyroid hormone disruptors on zebrafish embryos: A literature review of potential biomarkersIt is estimated that many organic compounds found in our environment can interfere with the thyroid system and act as thyroid hormone (TH) disruptor. Despite that, there is a clear lack of assays to identify TH disruptors. Recently zebrafish embryos were suggested as screening tool to identify compounds which impact thyroid synthesis. Effects on hormone level, gene transcript expression, eye development and swim bladder inflation are suggested as potential biomarker for TH disruptors. In order to assess the applicability of these biomarkers we performed a literature review. The effects of 25 known TH disrupting compounds were compared between studies. The studies were limited to exposures with embryos prior 7 days of development. The different study designs and the lack of standardized methods complicated the comparison of the results. The most common responses were morphological alterations and gene transcript expression changes, but no specific biomarker for TH disruption could be identified. In studies addressing TH disruption behavioral effects were more commonly monitored than in studies not mentioning the TH pathway. TH disruption in developing zebrafish embryos might be caused by different modes of action e.g. disruption of follicle development, binding of TH, activation of TH receptors causing different effects. Timing of developmental processes in combination with exposure duration might also play a role. On the other side compound characteristics (uptake, stability, metabolization) could also cause differences between substances. Further studies are necessary to gain better understanding into the mechanisms of TH disruption in early zebrafish development."

  "description": "Nanobodies: New avenues for imaging, stabilizing and modulating GPCRsThe family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is the largest class of membrane proteins and an important drug target due to their role in many (patho)physiological processes. Besides small molecules, GPCRs can be targeted by biologicals including antibodies and antibody fragments. This review describes the use of antibodies and in particular antibody fragments from camelid-derived heavy chain-only antibodies (nanobodies/VHHs/sdAbs) for detecting, stabilizing, modulating and therapeutically targeting GPCRs. Altogether, it becomes increasingly clear that the small size, structure and protruding antigen-binding loops of nanobodies are favorable features for the development of selective and potent GPCRs-binding molecules. This makes them attractive tools to modulate GPCR activity but also as targeting modalities for GPCR-directed therapeutics. In addition, these antibody-fragments are important tools in the stabilization of particular conformations of these receptors. Lastly, nanobodies, in contrast to conventional antibodies, can also easily be expressed intracellularly which render nanobodies important tools for studying GPCR function. Hence, GPCR-targeting nanobodies are ideal modalities to image, stabilize and modulate GPCR function."

  "description": "Potential application of lactic acid starters in the reduction of aflatoxin contamination in fermented sorghum-millet beveragesBackground: Aflatoxin contamination in traditionally fermented cereal-based beverages is a serious food safety challenge considering that commercialization of these products is rising. The challenge is aggravated by the fact that aflatoxin elimination from the food chain is almost impossible. This paper focuses on Obushera, a popular traditional spontaneously fermented sorghum \u2013 millet beverage from Uganda. Method: Mold and total aflatoxin levels in cereal flours and Obushera from different markets in Kampala were determined. Ability of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starters from Obushera; Lb. plantarum MNC 21, W. confusa MNC 20 and L. lactis MNC 24 to bind aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) was evaluated against Lb. rhamnosus yoba 2012 as the reference strain. Results: Mold counts in sorghum, millet and Obushera ranged between 0.0\u20132.4 log cfu/g, 2.0\u20136.5 log cfu/g and 2.0\u20135.5 log cfu/g, respectively. None of the flours complied with food safety standards for molds (maximum = 4 log cfu/g) while 88.0% of Obushera did (standard = maximum 1.3 log cfu/g). Total aflatoxin levels in sorghum, millet and Obushera were 22.3 \u00b1 21.2 ppb, 9.9 \u00b1 10.0 ppb and 10.4 \u00b1 6.1 ppb, respectively. LAB bound 19.3\u201369.4% of AFB1 in a 1000 ppb solution with binding efficiency in the order of Lb. rhamnosus yoba 2012 = Lb. plantarum MNC 21 > W. confusa MNC 20 = L. lactis MNC 24. The LAB-AFB1complex remained stable under a series of washes with physiological saline. Conclusion: This study indicates that LAB with aflatoxin binding properties can be exploited for controlled cereal fermentations to improve food safety."

  "description": "Harmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biologyLife science researchers use computational models to articulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of biological systems. Semantic annotation is a critical component for enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models, accelerate model composition and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms. Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current annotation practices among the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork community and provide a set of recommendations for building a consensus approach to semantic annotation."

Several pathogenic mutations are reported in the glucose transporter subfamily SLC2, causing Glut1-deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS1, GLUT1DS2), epilepsy (EIG2) and cryohydrocytosis with neurological defects (Dystonia-9). Understanding the link between these mutations and transporter dynamics is crucial to elucidate their role in the dysfunction of the underlying transport mechanism. Methods: Predictions from SIFT and PolyPhen provided an impression of the impact upon mutation in the highly conserved RXGRR motifs, but no clear differentiation could be made by these methods between pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations. Therefore, to identify the molecular effects on the transporter function, insight from molecular dynamic simulations is required. We studied a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations, using a newly developed coarse-grained simulation approach \u2018ConsDYN\u2019, which allows the sampling of both inward-open and outward-occluded states. To guarantee the sampling of large conformational changes, we only include conserved restraints of the elastic network introduced upon coarse-graining, which showed similar reference distances between the two conformational states (\u22641 \u00e5 difference). Results: We capture the \u2018conserved dynamics\u2019 between both states using ConsDYN. Simultaneously, it allowed us to considerably lower the computational costs of our study. This approach is sufficiently sensitive to capture the effect of different mutations, and our results clearly indicate that the pathogenic mutation in GLUT1, G91D, situated at the highly conserved RXGRR motif between helices 2 and 3, has a strong impact on channel function, as it blocks the protein from sampling both conformational states. Conclusions: Using our approach, we can explain the pathogenicity of the mutation G91D when we observe the configurations of the transmembrane helices, suggesting that their relative position is crucial for the correct functioning of the GLUT1 protein."

  "description": "Secondary Electrostatic Interaction Model Revised: Prediction Comes Mainly from Measuring Charge Accumulation in Hydrogen-Bonded MonomersThe secondary electrostatic interaction (SEI) model is often used to predict and explain relative hydrogen bond strengths of self-assembled systems. The SEI model oversimplifies the hydrogen-bonding mechanisms by viewing them as interacting point charges, but nevertheless experimental binding strengths are often in line with the model's predictions. To understand how this rudimentary model can be predictive, we computationally studied two tautomeric quadruple hydrogen-bonded systems, DDAA-AADD and DADA-ADAD. Our results reveal that when the proton donors D (which are electron-donating) and the proton acceptors A (which are electron-withdrawing) are grouped together as in DDAA, there is a larger accumulation of charge around the frontier atoms than when the proton donor and acceptor groups are alternating as in DADA. This accumulation of charge makes the proton donors more positive and the proton acceptors more negative, which enhances both the electrostatic and covalent interactions in the DDAA dimer. The SEI model is thus predictive because it provides a measure for the charge accumulation in hydrogen-bonded monomers. Our findings can be understood from simple physical organic chemistry principles and provide supramolecular chemists with meaningful understanding for tuning hydrogen bond strengths and thus for controlling the properties of self-assembled systems."

  "description": "Comparative genomics of human Lactobacillus crispatus isolates reveals genes for glycosylation and glycogen degradation: Implications for in vivo dominance of the vaginal microbiotaBACKGROUND: A vaginal microbiota dominated by lactobacilli (particularly Lactobacillus crispatus) is associated with vaginal health, whereas a vaginal microbiota not dominated by lactobacilli is considered dysbiotic. Here we investigated whether L. crispatus strains isolated from the vaginal tract of women with Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota (LVM) are pheno- or genotypically distinct from L. crispatus strains isolated from vaginal samples with dysbiotic vaginal microbiota (DVM).RESULTS: We studied 33\u2009L. crispatus strains (n\u2009=\u200916 from LVM; n\u2009=\u200917 from DVM). Comparison of these two groups of strains showed that, although strain differences existed, both groups degraded various carbohydrates, produced similar amounts of organic acids, inhibited Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth, and did not produce biofilms. Comparative genomics analyses of 28 strains (n\u2009=\u200912 LVM; n\u2009=\u200916 DVM) revealed a novel, 3-fragmented glycosyltransferase gene that was more prevalent among strains isolated from DVM. Most L. crispatus strains showed growth on glycogen-supplemented growth media. Strains that showed less-efficient (n\u2009=\u20096) or no (n\u2009=\u20091) growth on glycogen all carried N-terminal deletions (respectively, 29 and 37 amino acid deletions) in a putative pullulanase type I protein.DISCUSSION: L. crispatus strains isolated from LVM were not phenotypically distinct from L. crispatus strains isolated from DVM; however, the finding that the latter were more likely to carry a 3-fragmented glycosyltransferase gene may indicate a role for cell surface glycoconjugates, which may shape vaginal microbiota-host interactions. Furthermore, the observation that variation in the pullulanase type I gene is associated with growth on glycogen discourages previous claims that L. crispatus cannot directly utilize glycogen."

In particular, T4 inner-ring deiodination pathways assisted by naphthyl-based models bearing two tellurols and a tellurol-thiol pair in peri-position are explored and compared with the analogous energy profiles for the naphthalene mimic having two selenols. The presence of a halogen bond (XB) in the intermediate formed in the first step and involved in the rate-determining step of the reaction is assumed to facilitate the process increasing the rate of the reaction. The rate-determining step calculated energy barrier heights allow rationalizing the experimentally observed superior catalytic activity of tellurium containing mimics. Charge displacement analysis is used to ascertain the presence and the role of the electron density charge transfer occurring in the rate-determining step of the reaction, suggesting the incipient formation or presence of a XB interaction."

  "description": "Aflatoxins: Occurrence, exposure, and binding to lactobacillus species from the gut microbiota of rural ugandan childrenChronic exposure of children in sub-Saharan Africa to aflatoxins has been associated with low birth weight, stunted growth, immune suppression, and liver function damage. Lactobacillus species have been shown to reduce aflatoxin contamination during the process of food fermentation. Twenty-three Lactobacillus strains were isolated from fecal samples obtained from a cohort of rural Ugandan children at the age of 54 to 60 months, typed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and characterized in terms of their ability to bind aflatoxin B1 in vitro. Evidence for chronic exposure of these children to aflatoxin B1 in the study area was obtained by analysis of local foods (maize flour and peanuts), followed by the identification of the breakdown product aflatoxin M1 in their urine samples. Surprisingly, Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota of 140 children from the same cohort at 24 and 36 months showed the highest positive correlation coefficient with stunting among all bacterial genera identified in the stool samples. This correlation was interpreted to be associated with dietary changes from breastfeeding to plant-based solid foods that pose an additional risk for aflatoxin contamination, on one hand, and lead to increased intake of Lactobacillus species on the other."

  "description": "Development and evaluation of a harmonized whole body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for flutamide in rats and its extrapolation to humansBy their definition, inadvertent exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) intervenes with the endocrine signalling system, even at low dose. On the one hand, some EDCs are used as important pharmaceutical drugs that one would not want to dismiss. On the other hand, these pharmaceutical drugs are having off-target effects and increasingly significant exposure to the general population with unwanted health implications. Flutamide, one of the top pharmaceutical products marketed all over the world for the treatment of prostate cancer, is also a pollutant. Its therapeutic action mainly depends on targeting the androgen receptors and inhibiting the androgen action that is essential for growth and survival of prostate tissue. Currently flutamide is of concern with respect to its categorization as an endocrine disruptor. In this work we have developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of flutamide that could serve as a standard tool for its human risk assessment. First we built the model for rat (where many parameters have been measured). The rat PBPK model was extrapolated to human where the re-parameterization involved human-specific physiology, metabolic kinetics derived from in-vitro studies, and the partition coefficient same as the rat model. We have harmonized the model by integrating different sets of in-vitro, in-vivo and physiological data into a PBPK model. Then the model was used to simulate different exposure scenarios and the results were compared against the observed data. Both uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was done. Since this new whole-body PBPK model can predict flutamide concentrations not only in plasma but also in various organs, the model may have clinical applications in efficacy and safety assessment of flutamide. The model can also be used for reverse dosimetry in the context of interpreting the available biomonitoring data to estimate the degree to which the population is currently being exposed, and a tool for the pharmaceutical companies to validate the estimated Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) for flutamide."

  "description": "Global interlaboratory assessments of perfluoroalkyl substances under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutantsThe Global Monitoring Plan (GMP) according to article 16 of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) requires that POP laboratories must be capable \u2013 at any time \u2013 to analyse samples for POPs within a variation of \u00b125%. Based on this target error of 25%, a statistical model using z-scores was applied to assess the performance of analytical laboratories for POPs and a number of matrices. Since the second round of these \u2018Bi-ennial Global Interlaboratory Assessment on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)\u2019, carried out in 2012/2013, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been included into the proficiency tests. The third round was carried out in 2016/2017. The test materials included test solutions of PFASs analytical standards, the abiotic matrices sediment, air (extract) and water and the biotic matrices fish, human milk and human plasma. The number of laboratories submitting results for PFASs remained quite stable (IL2 = 27 laboratories; IL3 = 29), but there was broader geographic distribution observed in IL3: in addition to the laboratories from Asia and the Western Europe/other groups, two laboratories from Africa participated, two from Central-Eastern Europe and one from the Latin American/Caribbean region.Considering that PFASs were introduced for the first time in round 2, the results were good to reasonable compared to those of a number of other POPs included in the same study. However, it shall also be mentioned that for some matrices and PFASs, the number of laboratories submitting results was too small and the results too scattered to derive a consensus value. This was especially true for the PFOS precursor compounds and the air matrix. Also, laboratories struggle with the analysis of the branched PFOS isomers.These interlaboratory assessments on PFASs gave promising results and demonstrated the importance of proficiency tests in an international environment to generate trust in laboratory results. The need to participate regularly in such intercomparison assessments is highlighted. The results show the current level of PFAS analysis, which varies by laboratory and by matrix rather than per geographic region."

Two out of eighteen derivatives, compounds 12a and 12h, showed remarkably cytotoxic activity with the half maximal inhibitory concentration values (IC50) ranging from 0.23 to 11.4 \u03bcM, and 0.29\u201312.2 \u03bcM, respectively. However, two additional compounds, 12b and 13g, displayed remarkable in vitro antiproliferative activity against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines, including immortalized (SUIT-2, Capan-1, Panc-1), primary (PDAC-3) and gemcitabine-resistant (Panc-1R), eliciting IC50 values ranging from micromolar to sub-micromolar level, associated with significant reduction of cell-migration and spheroid shrinkage. These remarkable results might be explained by modulation of key regulators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), including E-cadherin and vimentin, and inhibition of metalloproteinase-2/-9. High-throughput arrays revealed a significant inhibition of the phosphorylation of 45 tyrosine kinases substrates, whose visualization on Cytoscape highlighted PTK2/FAK as an important hub. Inhibition of phosphorylation of PTK2/FAK was validated as one of the possible mechanisms of action, using a specific ELISA. In conclusion, novel imidazothiadiazoles show potent antiproliferative activity, mediated by modulation of EMT and PTK2/FAK."

  "description": "Long-term exposure of activated sludge in chemostats leads to changes in microbial communities composition and enhanced biodegradation of 4-chloroaniline and N-methylpiperazineExposure history and adaptation of the inoculum to chemicals have been shown to influence the outcome of ready biodegradability tests. However, there is a lack of information about the mechanisms involved in microbial adaptation and the implication thereof for the tests. In the present study, we investigated the impact of a long-term exposure to N-methylpiperazine (NMP) and 4-chloroaniline (4CA) of an activated sludge microbial community using chemostat systems. The objective was to characterize the influence of adaptation to the chemicals on an enhanced biodegradation testing, following the OECD 310 guideline. Cultures were used to inoculate the enhanced biodegradability tests, in batch, before and after exposure to each chemical independently in chemostat culture. Composition and diversity of the microbial communities were characterised by 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Using freshly sampled activated sludge, NMP was not degraded within the 28 d frame of the test while 4CA was completely eliminated. However, after one month of exposure, the community exposed to NMP was adapted and could completely degrade it. This result was in complete contrast with that from the culture exposed for 3 months to 4CA. Long term incubation in the chemostat system led to a progressive loss of the initial biodegradation capacity of the community, as a consequence of the loss of key degrading microorganisms. This study highlights the potential of chemostat systems to induce adaptation to a specific chemical, ultimately resulting in its biodegradation. At the same time, one should be critical of these observations as the dynamics of a microbial community are difficult to maintain in chemostat, as the loss of 4CA biodegradation capacity demonstrates."

  "description": "Oral butyrate does not affect innate immunity and islet autoimmunity in individuals with longstanding type 1 diabetes: a randomised controlled trialAims/hypothesis: The pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes has been linked to altered gut microbiota and more specifically to a shortage of intestinal production of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate, which may play key roles in maintaining intestinal epithelial integrity and in human and gut microbial metabolism. Butyrate supplementation can protect against autoimmune diabetes in mouse models. We thus set out to study the effect of oral butyrate vs placebo on glucose regulation and immune variables in human participants with longstanding type 1 diabetes. Methods: We administered a daily oral dose of 4g sodium butyrate or placebo for 1month to 30 individuals with longstanding type 1 diabetes, without comorbidity or medication use, in a randomised (1:1), controlled, double-blind crossover trial, with a washout period of 1month in between. Participants were randomly allocated to the \u2018oral sodium butyrate capsules first\u2019 or \u2018oral placebo capsules first\u2019 study arm in blocks of five. The clinical investigator received blinded medication from the clinical trial pharmacy. All participants, people doing measurements or examinations, or people assessing the outcomes were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was a change in the innate immune phenotype (monocyte subsets and in vitro cytokine production). Secondary outcomes were changes in blood markers of islet autoimmunity (cell counts, lymphocyte stimulation indices and CD8 quantum dot assays), glucose and lipid metabolism, beta cell function (by mixed-meal test), gut microbiota and faecal SCFA. The data was collected at the Amsterdam University Medical Centers. Results: All 30 participants were analysed. Faecal butyrate and propionate levels were significantly affected by oral butyrate supplementation and butyrate treatment was safe. However, this modulation of intestinal SCFAs did not result in any significant changes in adaptive or innate immunity, or in any of the other outcome variables. In our discussion, we elaborate on this important discrepancy with previous animal work. Conclusions/interpretation: Oral butyrate supplementation does not significantly affect innate or adaptive immunity in humans with longstanding type 1 diabetes. Trial registration: Netherlands Trial Register: NL4832 (www.trialregister.nl). Data availability: Raw sequencing data are available in the European Nucleotide Archive repository (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browse) under study PRJEB30292.

  "description": "Analysis of Vibrational Circular Dichroism Spectra of Peptides: A Generalized Coupled Oscillator Approach of a Small Peptide Model Using VCDtoolsVibrational circular dichroism (VCD) is one of the major spectroscopic tools to study peptides. Nevertheless, a full understanding of what determines the signs and intensities of VCD bands of these compounds in the amide I and amide II spectral regions is still far from complete. In the present work, we study the origin of these VCD signals using the general coupled oscillator (GCO) analysis, a novel approach that has recently been developed. We apply this approach to the ForValNHMe model peptide in both \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-sheet configurations. We show that the intense VCD signals observed in the amide I and amide II spectral regions essentially have the same underlying mechanism, namely, the through-space coupling of electric dipoles. The crucial role played by intramolecular hydrogen bonds in determining VCD intensities is also illustrated. Moreover, we find that the contributions to the rotational strengths, considered to be insignificant in standard VCD models, may have sizable magnitudes and can thus not always be neglected. In addition, the VCD robustness of the amide I and II modes has been investigated by monitoring the variation of the rotational strength and its contributing terms during linear transit scans and by performing calculations with different computational parameters. From these studies - and in particular, the decomposition of the rotational strength made possible by the GCO analysis - it becomes clear that one should be cautious when employing measures of robustness as proposed previously."

We describe a new hot loop mimicking modality, termed PepNats, in which natural product (NP)-inspired structures are incorporated as conformation-determining and -restricting structural elements into macrocyclic hot loop-derived peptides. Macrocyclic PepNats representing hot loops of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and human agouti-related protein (AGRP) were synthesized on solid support employing macrocyclization by imine formation and subsequent stereoselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition as key steps. PepNats derived from the iNOS DINNN hot loop and the AGRP RFF hot spot sequence yielded novel and potent ligands of the SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 2 (SPSB2) that binds to iNOS, and selective ligands for AGRP-binding melanocortin (MC) receptors. NP-inspired fragment absolute configuration determines the conformation of the peptide part responsible for binding. These results demonstrate that combination of NP-inspired scaffolds with peptidic epitopes enables identification of novel hot loop mimics with conformationally constrained and biologically relevant structure."

Contrary to the prevailing notion that polaron formation slows down charge-carrier cooling in lead-halide perovskites, no suppression of carrier cooling is observed in CsPbBr3 nanocrystals except for a slow cooling (over \u223c10 ps) of \"warm\" electrons in the vicinity (within \u223c0.1 eV) of the conduction band edge. At higher excess energies, electrons and holes cool with similar rates, on the order of 1 eV ps-1 carrier-1, increasing weakly with size. Our ab initio simulations suggest that cooling proceeds via fast phonon-mediated intraband transitions driven by strong and size-dependent electron-phonon coupling. The presented experimental and computational methods yield the spectrum of involved phonons and may guide the development of devices utilizing hot charge carriers."

  "description": "Probing Protein Denaturation during Size-Exclusion Chromatography Using Native Mass SpectrometrySize-exclusion chromatography employing aqueous mobile phases with volatile salts at neutral pH combined with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (SEC-ESI-MS) is a useful tool to study proteins in their native state. However, whether the applied eluent conditions actually prevent protein-stationary phase interactions, and/or protein denaturation, often is not assessed. In this study, the effects of volatile mobile phase additives on SEC retention and ESI of proteins were thoroughly investigated. Myoglobin was used as the main model protein, and eluents of varying ionic strength and pH were applied. The degree of interaction between protein and stationary phase was evaluated by calculating the SEC distribution coefficient. Protein-ion charge state distributions obtained during offline and online native ESI-MS were used to monitor alterations in protein structure. Interestingly, most of the supposedly mild eluent compositions induced nonideal SEC behavior and/or protein unfolding. SEC experiments revealed that the nature, ionic strength, and pH of the eluent affected protein retention. Protein-stationary phase interactions were effectively avoided using ammonium acetate at ionic strengths above 0.1 M. Direct-infusion ESI-MS showed that the tested volatile eluent salts seem to follow the Hofmeister series: no denaturation was induced using ammonium acetate (kosmotropic), whereas ammonium formate and bicarbonate (both chaotropic) caused structural changes. Using a mobile phase of 0.2 M ammonium acetate (pH 6.9), several proteins (i.e., myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c) could be analyzed by SEC-ESI-MS using different column chemistries without compromising their native state. Overall, with SEC-ESI-MS, the effect of nonspecific interactions between protein and stationary phase on the protein structure can be studied, even revealing gradual structural differences along a peak."

  "description": "Aralar Sequesters GABA into Hyperactive Mitochondria, Causing Social Behavior DeficitsSocial impairment is frequently associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and altered neurotransmission. Although mitochondrial function is crucial for brain homeostasis, it remains unknown whether mitochondrial disruption contributes to social behavioral deficits. Here, we show that Drosophila mutants in the homolog of the human CYFIP1, a gene linked to autism and schizophrenia, exhibit mitochondrial hyperactivity and altered group behavior. We identify the regulation of GABA availability by mitochondrial activity as a biologically relevant mechanism and demonstrate its contribution to social behavior. Specifically, increased mitochondrial activity causes gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) sequestration in the mitochondria, reducing GABAergic signaling and resulting in social deficits. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of mitochondrial activity or GABA signaling corrects the observed abnormalities. We identify Aralar as the mitochondrial transporter that sequesters GABA upon increased mitochondrial activity. This study increases our understanding of how mitochondria modulate neuronal homeostasis and social behavior under physiopathological conditions."

  "description": "Ambident Nucleophilic Substitution: Understanding Non-HSAB Behavior through Activation Strain and Conceptual DFT AnalysesThe ability to understand and predict ambident reactivity is key to the rational design of organic syntheses. An approach to understand trends in ambident reactivity is the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. The recent controversy over the general validity of this principle prompted us to investigate the competing gas-phase SN2 reaction channels of archetypal ambident nucleophiles CN\u2212, OCN\u2212, and SCN\u2212 with CH3Cl (SN2@C) and SiH3Cl (SN2@Si), using DFT calculations. Our combined analyses highlight the inability of the HSAB principle to correctly predict the reactivity trends of these simple, model reactions. Instead, we have successfully traced reactivity trends to the canonical orbital-interaction mechanism and the resulting nucleophile\u2013substrate interaction energy. The HOMO\u2013LUMO orbital interactions set the trend in both SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions. We provide simple rules for predicting the ambident reactivity of nucleophiles based on our Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analysis."

However, accurate modeling of halogen bond interactions remains a challenge, since a thorough theoretical investigation of the bonding mechanism, focusing on the realistic complexity of drug-receptor systems, is lacking. Our systematic quantum-chemical study on ligand/peptide-like systems reveals that halogen bonding is driven by the same bonding interactions as hydrogen bonding. Besides the electrostatic and the dispersion interactions, our bonding analyses, based on quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital theory together with energy decomposition analysis, reveal that donor-acceptor interactions and steric repulsion between the occupied orbitals of the halogenated ligand and the protein need to be considered more carefully within the drug design process."

Seven subtypes (I\u2013VII) have been identified using molecular biology approaches, of which subtype I is the most frequent causative agent of human disease. To investigate the genotypes and pathogenic components of M. kansasii, we sequenced and compared the complete base-perfect genomes of different M. kansasii subtypes. Our findings support the proposition that M. kansasii \u201csubtypes\u201d I-VI, whose assemblies are currently available, should be considered as different species. Furthermore, we identified the exclusive presence of the espACD operon in M. kansasii subtype I, and we confirmed its role in the pathogenicity of M. kansasii in a cell infection model. The espACD operon is exclusively present in mycobacterial species that induce phagosomal rupture in host phagocytes and is known to be a major determinant of ESX1-mediated virulence in pathogenic mycobacteria. Comparative transcriptome analysis of the M. kansasii I-V strains identified genes potentially associated with virulence. Using a comparative genomics approach, we designed primers for PCR genotyping of M. kansasii subtypes I-V and tested their efficacy using clinically relevant strains of M. kansasii."

  "description": "An Improved ATP FRET Sensor for Yeast Shows Heterogeneity during Nutrient TransitionsAdenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) is the main free energy carrier in metabolism. In budding yeast, shifts to glucose-rich conditions cause dynamic changes in ATP levels, but it is unclear how heterogeneous these dynamics are at a single-cell level. Furthermore, pH also changes and affects readout of fluorescence-based biosensors for single-cell measurements. To measure ATP changes reliably in single yeast cells, we developed yAT1.03, an adapted version of the AT1.03 ATP biosensor, that is pH-insensitive. We show that pregrowth conditions largely affect ATP dynamics during transitions. Moreover, single-cell analyses showed a large variety in ATP responses, which implies large differences of glycolytic startup between individual cells. We found three clusters of dynamic responses, and we show that a small subpopulation of wild-type cells reached an imbalanced state during glycolytic startup, characterized by low ATP levels. These results confirm the need for new tools to study dynamic responses of individual cells in dynamic environments."

  "description": "Combined cellomics and proteomics analysis reveals shared neuronal morphology and molecular pathway phenotypes for multiple schizophrenia risk genesAn enigma in studies of neuropsychiatric disorders is how to translate polygenic risk into disease biology. For schizophrenia, where > 145 significant GWAS loci have been identified and only a few genes directly implicated, addressing this issue is a particular challenge. We used a combined cellomics and proteomics approach to show that polygenic risk can be disentangled by searching for shared neuronal morphology and cellular pathway phenotypes of candidate schizophrenia risk genes. We first performed an automated high-content cellular screen to characterize neuronal morphology phenotypes of 41 candidate schizophrenia risk genes. The transcription factors Tcf4 and Tbr1 and the RNA topoisomerase Top3b shared a neuronal phenotype marked by an early and progressive reduction in synapse numbers upon knockdown in mouse primary neuronal cultures. Proteomics analysis subsequently showed that these three genes converge onto the syntaxin-mediated neurotransmitter release pathway, which was previously implicated in schizophrenia, but for which genetic evidence was weak. We show that dysregulation of multiple proteins in this pathway may be due to the combined effects of schizophrenia risk genes Tcf4, Tbr1, and Top3b. Together, our data provide new biological functions for schizophrenia risk genes and support the idea that polygenic risk is the result of multiple small impacts on common neuronal signaling pathways."

Climate change is expected to result in a higher frequency of extreme weather events including torrential rainfall and storms. The contaminant levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated paraffins (CPF) and selected metals, in a small urban river were monitored during snow-melting and rainfall events to quantify the contribution to the contamination load of receiving waters of the inner Oslo fjord, Norway. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was characterized with respect to levels of contaminants as well as toxic response using a battery of bioassays. The contaminant flux from the river to the fjord was quantified and assessed relative to sediment data. Historic data for near-shore sediment samples from the fjord were used to document urban input. The results show a clear episodic response in contaminant load emitted from the river to the fjord. The main historic input to the fjord was found to be PAH from pyrogenic sources like coal and wood burning as well as traffic. A significant reduction in the level of PAH was observed since the 1980s. The measured flux of CPF is consistent with on-going societal use despite a ban on the use of short chain CPF imposed in Norway from 2002."

  "description": "Serial propagation in water-in-oil emulsions selects for Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with a reduced cell size or an increased biomass yield on glucoseIn S. cerevisiae and many other micro-organisms an increase in metabolic efficiency (i.e. ATP yield on carbon) is accompanied by a decrease in growth rate. From a fundamental point of view, studying these yield-rate trade-offs provides insight in for example microbial evolution and cellular regulation. From a biotechnological point of view, increasing the ATP yield on carbon might increase the yield of anabolic products. We here aimed to select S. cerevisiae mutants with an increased biomass yield. Serial propagation of individual cells in water-in-oil emulsions previously enabled the selection of lactococci with increased biomass yields, and adapting this protocol for yeast allowed us to enrich an engineered Crabtree-negative S. cerevisiae strain with a high biomass yield on glucose. When we started the selection with an S. cerevisiae deletion collection, serial propagation in emulsion enriched hxk2\u0394 and reg1\u0394 strains with an increased biomass yield on glucose. Surprisingly, a tps1\u0394 strain was highly abundant in both emulsion- and suspension-propagated populations. In a separate experiment we propagated a chemically mutagenized S. cerevisiae population in emulsion, which resulted in mutants with a higher cell number yield on glucose, but no significantly changed biomass yield. Genome analyses indicate that genes involved in glucose repression and cell cycle processes play a role in the selected phenotypes. The repeated identification of mutations in genes involved in glucose-repression indicates that serial propagation in emulsion is a valuable tool to study metabolic efficiency in S. cerevisiae."

By combining immunohistochemistry (IHC) and laser microdissection (LMD) we isolated neurons with GVD and those bearing tangles separately from human post-mortem AD hippocampus (n = 12) using their typical markers casein kinase (CK)1\u03b4 and phosphorylated tau (AT8). Control neurons were isolated from cognitively healthy cases (n = 12). 3000 neurons per sample were used for proteome analysis by label free LC\u2013MS/MS. In total 2596 proteins were quantified across samples and a significant change in abundance of 115 proteins in GVD and 197 in tangle bearing neurons was observed compared to control neurons. With IHC the presence of PPIA, TOMM34, HSP70, CHMP1A, TPPP and VXN was confirmed in GVD containing neurons. We found multiple proteins localizing specifically to the GVD bodies, with VXN and TOMM34 being the most prominent new protein markers for GVD bodies. In general, protein groups relatedto protein folding, proteasomal function, the endolysosomal pathway, microtubule and cytoskeletal related function, RNA processing and glycolysis were found to be changed in GVD neurons. In addition to these protein groups, tangle bearing neurons show a decrease in ribosomal proteins, as well as in various proteins related to protein folding. This study, for the first time, provides a comprehensive human based quantitative assessment of protein abundances in GVD and tangle bearing neurons. In line with previous functional data showing that tau pathology induces GVD, our data support the model that GVD is part of a pre-NFT stage representing a phase in which proteostasis and cellular homeostasis is disrupted. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes affected in GVD and its relation to the presence of tau pathology is highly relevant for the identification of new drug targets for therapy."

F- activates the nitrilimine, not CO2 as proposed in the literature, and imparts a significant rate enhancement for the cycloaddition. The origin of this catalysis is in the strength of the primary orbital interactions between the reactants. The Lewis base activated nitrilimine-F- has high-lying filled FMOs. The smaller FMO-LUMO gap promotes a rapid nucleophilic attack and overall cycloaddition with CO2. "

  "description": "In vitro biotransformation and evaluation of potential transformation products of chlorinated paraffins by high resolution accurate mass spectrometryChlorinated paraffins (CPs) are high production chemicals, which leads to their ubiquitous presence in the environment. To date, few studies have measured CPs in humans and typically at relatively low concentrations, despite indications that exposure may be high compared to various persistent organic pollutants. The aim of this study is to investigate the in vitro biotransformation of CPs by human liver fractions. We determined the changes of the CP concentrations after the enzymatic transformation with human liver microsomes using a two-tiered in vitro approach. CP concentrations decreased with human liver microsomes, with the decreases of 33\u201394% after incubating with different groups of enzymes for 2 h. The profiles of CP rapidly shifted after the incubation with human liver microsomes. In addition, the concentrations of CPs and the biotransformation products were tentatively measured using high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis, including very short CP (carbon chain length <10), alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids. C\u2012C bond cleavage is a potential transformation pathway for CPs, and ketones are potential products of CP biotransformation, especially for long-chain CPs (C>17). The ketone products may be investigated as CP exposure biomarker in biomonitoring studies."

  "description": "Site-Specific N-Linked Glycosylation Analysis of Human Carcinoembryonic Antigen by Sheathless Capillary Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass SpectrometryWith 28 potential N-glycosylation sites, human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) bears an extreme amount of N-linked glycosylation, and approximately 60% of its molecular mass can be attributed to its carbohydrates. CEA is often overexpressed and released by many solid tumors, including colorectal carcinomas. CEA displays an impressive heterogeneity and variability in sugar content; however, site-specific distribution of carbohydrate structures has not been reported so far. The present study investigated CEA samples purified from human colon carcinoma and human liver metastases and enabled the characterization of 21 out of 28 potential N-glycosylation sites with respect to their occupancy. The coverage was achieved by a multienzymatic digestion approach with specific enzymes, such as trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and the nonspecific enzyme, Pronase, followed by analysis using sheathless CE-MS/MS. In total, 893 different N-glycopeptides and 128 unique N-glycan compositions were identified. Overall, a great heterogeneity was found both within (micro) and in between (macro) individual N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, notable differences were found on certain N-glycosylation sites between primary adenocarcinoma and metastatic tumor in regard to branching, bisection, sialylation, and fucosylation. Those features, if further investigated in a targeted manner, may pave the way toward improved diagnostics and monitoring of colorectal cancer progression and recurrence. Raw mass spectrometric data and Skyline processed data files that support the findings of this study are available in the MassIVE repository with the identifier MSV000086774 [DOI: 10.25345/C5Z50X]. "

  "description": "A flat embedding method for transmission electron microscopy reveals an unknown mechanism of tetracyclineTransmission electron microscopy of cell sample sections is a popular technique in microbiology. Currently, ultrathin sectioning is done on resin-embedded cell pellets, which consumes milli- to deciliters of culture and results in sections of randomly orientated cells. This is problematic for rod-shaped bacteria and often precludes large-scale quantification of morphological phenotypes due to the lack of sufficient numbers of longitudinally cut cells. Here we report a flat embedding method that enables observation of thousands of longitudinally cut cells per single section and only requires microliter culture volumes. We successfully applied this technique to Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium bovis, and Acholeplasma laidlawii. To assess the potential of the technique to quantify morphological phenotypes, we monitored antibiotic-induced changes in B. subtilis cells. Surprisingly, we found that the ribosome inhibitor tetracycline causes membrane deformations. Further investigations showed that tetracycline disturbs membrane organization and localization of the peripheral membrane proteins MinD, MinC, and MreB. These observations are not the result of ribosome inhibition but constitute a secondary antibacterial activity of tetracycline that so far has defied discovery."

  "description": "Generalization of Intrinsic Orbitals to Kramers-Paired Quaternion Spinors, Molecular Fragments, and Valence Virtual SpinorsLocalization of molecular orbitals finds its importance in the representation of chemical bonding (and antibonding) and in the local correlation treatments beyond mean-field approximation. In this paper, we generalize the intrinsic atomic and bonding orbitals [G. Knizia, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 11, 4834-4843] to relativistic applications using complex and quaternion spinors, as well as to molecular fragments instead of atomic fragments only. By performing a singular value decomposition, we show how localized valence virtual orbitals can be expressed on this intrinsic minimal basis. We demonstrate our method on systems of increasing complexity, starting from simple cases such as benzene, acrylic acid, and ferrocene molecules, and then demonstrate the use of molecular fragments and inclusion of relativistic effects for complexes containing heavy elements such as tellurium, iridium, and astatine. The aforementioned scheme is implemented into a standalone program interfaced with several different quantum chemistry packages."

  "description": "Differential Involvement of ACKR3 C-Tail in \u03b2-Arrestin Recruitment, Trafficking and InternalizationBackground: The atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Unlike classical GPCRs, this receptor does not activate G proteins in most cell types but recruits \u03b2-arrestins upon activation. ACKR3 plays an important role in cancer and vascular diseases. As recruitment of \u03b2-arrestins is triggered by phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of GPCRs, we studied the role of different potential phosphorylation sites within the ACKR3 C-tail to further delineate the molecular mechanism of internalization and trafficking of this GPCR. Methods: We used various bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based sensors and techniques in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T cells expressing WT or phosphorylation site mutants of ACKR3 to measure CXCL12-induced recruitment of \u03b2-arrestins and G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), receptor internalization and trafficking. Results: Upon CXCL12 stimulation, ACKR3 recruits both \u03b2-arrestin 1 and 2 with equivalent kinetic profiles. We identified interactions with GRK2, 3 and 5, with GRK2 and 3 being important for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Upon activation, ACKR3 internalizes and recycles back to the cell membrane. We demonstrate that \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the receptor is mainly determined by a single cluster of phosphorylated residues on the C-tail of ACKR3, and that residue T352 and in part S355 are important residues for \u03b2-arrestin1 recruitment. Phosphorylation of the C-tail appears essential for ligand-induced internalization and important for differential \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. GRK2 and 3 play a key role in receptor internalization. Moreover, ACKR3 can still internalize when \u03b2-arrestin recruitment is impaired or in the absence of \u03b2-arrestins, using alternative internalization pathways. Our data indicate that distinct residues within the C-tail of ACKR3 differentially regulate CXCL12-induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, ACKR3 trafficking and internalization."

(Thio)ureas render the studied Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition reactions exo selective and induce a significant acceleration of this process by lowering the reaction barrier by up to 7 kcal mol\u22121. Our activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analyses uncover that these organocatalysts enhance the Diels\u2013Alder reactivity by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled \u03c0-orbitals of the diene and dienophile, by polarizing the \u03c0-orbitals away from the reactive center and not by making the orbital interactions between the reactants stronger. In addition, we establish that the unprecedented exo selectivity of the hydrogen bond donor-catalyzed Diels\u2013Alder reactions is directly related to the larger degree of asynchronicity along this reaction pathway, which is manifested in a relief of destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion."

  "description": "Model selection reveals the butyrate-producing gut bacterium Coprococcus eutactus as predictor for language development in three-year-old rural Ugandan childrenIntroduction The metabolic activity of the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the gut-brain axis through the effects of bacterial metabolites on brain function and development. In this study we investigated the association of gut microbiota composition with language development of three-year-old rural Ugandan children.Methods We studied the language ability in 139 children of 36 months in our controlled maternal education intervention trial to stimulate children\u2019s growth and development. The dataset includes 1170 potential predictors, including anthropometric and cognitive parameters at 24 months, 542 composition parameters of the children\u2019s gut microbiota at 24 months and 621 of these parameters at 36 months. We applied a novel computationally efficient version of the all-subsets regression methodology and identified predictors of language ability of 36-months-old children scored according to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III).Results The best three-term model, selected from more than 266 million models, includes the predictors Coprococcus eutactus at 24 months of age, Bifidobacterium at 36 months of age, and language development at 24 months. The top 20 four-term models, selected from more than 77 billion models, consistently include Coprococcus eutactus abundance at 24 months, while 14 of these models include the other two predictors as well. Mann-Whitney U tests further suggest that the abundance of gut bacteria in language non-impaired children (n = 78) differs from that in language impaired children (n = 61) at 24 months. While obligate anaerobic butyrate-producers, including Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Holdemanella biformis, Roseburia hominis are less abundant, facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Granulicatella elegans, Escherichia/Shigella and Campylobacter coli, are more abundant in language impaired children. The overall predominance of oxygen tolerant species in the gut microbiota of Ugandan children at the age 24 months, expressed as the Metagenomic Aerotolerant Predominance Index (MAPI), was slightly higher in the language impaired group than in the non-impaired group (P = 0.09).Conclusions Application of the all-subsets regression methodology to microbiota data established a correlation between the relative abundance of the anaerobic butyrate-producing gut bacterium Coprococcus eutactus and language development in Ugandan children. We propose that the gut redox potential and the overall bacterial butyrate-producing capacity could be factors of importance as gut microbiota members with a positive correlation to language development are mostly strictly anaerobic butyrate-producers, while microbiota members that correlate negatively, are predominantly oxygen tolerant with a variety of known adverse effects."

  "description": "Do Sulfonamides Interact with Aromatic Rings?Aromatic rings form energetically favorable interactions with many polar groups in chemical and biological systems. Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here, synthetic, spectroscopic, structural, and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6-diarylbenzenesulfonamides are reported, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety. Fine-tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. This physical-organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides via through-space NH\u2013\u03c0 interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron-rich aromatic rings in proteins."

  "description": "How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate ReactivityA judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce endo/exo stereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. The Diels\u2013Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride is studied by using quantitative activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, and the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor\u2013acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the exo pathway of this reaction, whereas the endo pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the endo/exo stereoselectivity. The influence of the OEEF on the inverse electron demand Diels\u2013Alder reaction is also investigated; unexpectedly, it inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor\u2013acceptor interaction."

  "description": "How metallylenes activate small moleculesWe have studied the activation of dihydrogen by metallylenes using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses have quantified the physical factors behind the decreased reactivity of the metallylene on going down Group 14, from carbenes to stannylenes. Along this series, the reactivity decreases due to a worsening of the back-donation interaction between the filled lone-pair orbital of the metallylene and the \u03c3*-orbital of H2, which, therefore, reduces the metallylene-substrate interaction and increases the reaction barrier. As the metallylene ligand is varied from nitrogen to phosphorus to arsenic a significant rate enhancement is observed for the activation of H2due to (i) a reduced steric (Pauli) repulsion between the metallylene and the substrate; and (ii) less activation strain, as the metallylene becomes increasingly more predistorted. Using a rationally designed metallylene with an optimal Group 14 atom and ligand combination, we show that a number of small molecules (i.e.HCN, CO2, H2, NH3) may also be readily activated. For the first time, we show the ability of our H2activated designer metallylenes to hydrogenate unsaturated hydrocarbons. The results presented herein will serve as a guide for the rational design of metallylenes toward the activation of small molecules and subsequent reactions."

  "description": "Genome-wide data implicate terminal fusion automixis in king cobra facultative parthenogenesisFacultative parthenogenesis (FP) is widespread in the animal kingdom. In vertebrates it was first described in poultry nearly 70years ago, and since then reports involving other taxa have increased considerably. In the last two decades, numerous reports of FP have emerged in elasmobranch fishes and squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes), including documentation in wild populations of both clades. When considered in concert with recent evidence of reproductive competence, the accumulating data suggest that the significance of FP in vertebrate evolution has been largely underestimated. Several fundamental questions regarding developmental mechanisms, nonetheless, remain unanswered. Specifically, what is the type of automixis that underlies the production of progeny and how does this impact the genomic diversity of the resulting parthenogens? Here, we addressed these questions through the application of next-generation sequencing to investigate a suspected case of parthenogenesis in a king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah). Our results provide the first evidence of FP in this species, and provide novel evidence that rejects gametic duplication and supports terminal fusion as a mechanism underlying parthenogenesis in snakes. Moreover, we precisely estimated heterozygosity in parthenogenetic offspring and found appreciable retained genetic diversity that suggests that FP in vertebrates has underappreciated evolutionary significance."

  "description": "A systematic review on the role of imiquimod in lentigo maligna and lentigo maligna melanoma: need for standardization of treatment schedule and outcome measuresLentigo maligna (LM) is an in situ variant of melanoma. Our objective was to systematically review clinical and histological clearance and recurrence rates of imiquimod treatment of LM with emphasis on progression to lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM). PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane library were searched from inception to May 2015. Articles were included if they described histologically proven LM treated with imiquimod 5% monotherapy or combined with another topical therapy. Analysed outcomes were clinical and histological clearance, recurrence rates and number of LMM. The quality was assessed using the GRADE-like checklist, and results were reported according to the PRISMA Statement. Twenty-six case reports, 11 retrospective studies, three prospective studies and one randomized controlled trial were included. One case report of poor quality was excluded. Complete clinical clearance was seen in 369 of 471 patients (78.3%). Histological clearance was present in 285 of 370 (77%) patients. LMM was diagnosed in nine (1.8%) patients 3.9 months (range 0\u201311 months) post-treatment. Univariate multinominal logistic regression showed that 6\u20137 applications/week had a 6.47 greater odds (P = 0.017) of resulting in complete clinical clearance compared to 1\u20134 applications/week. An intensity of 6\u20137 applications/week showed a 8.85 greater odds (P = 0.003) of resulting in histological clearance compared to 1\u20134 applications. Applying imiquimod >60 times during a treatment period of 12 weeks (range 4\u201336) showed a 7.75 greater odds (P = 0.001) of resulting in histological clearance compared to <60 total applications. In conclusion, a treatment schedule using imiquimod 6\u20137 applications per week, with at least 60 applications, shows the greatest odds of complete clinical and histological clearance of LM. Imiquimod is an option for patients unfit for or not willing to undergo surgery or radiotherapy. Nine cases of LM progressed to LMM shortly after treatment. Our hypothesis is that these LMM may have been present before starting imiquimod."

The production of foods such as yogurt and cultured milk, wine and beer, sauerkraut and kimchi, and fermented sausage were initially valued because of their improved shelf life, safety, and organoleptic properties. It is increasingly understood that fermented foods can also have enhanced nutritional and functional properties due to transformation of substrates and formation of bioactive or bioavailable end-products. Many fermented foods also contain living microorganisms of which some are genetically similar to strains used as probiotics. Although only a limited number of clinical studies on fermented foods have been performed, there is evidence that these foods provide health benefits well-beyond the starting food materials."

In the UK, ready-made meals are more often consumed than in Brazil, a country in which nutrition transition is relatively low. This study aimed to compare the nutritional quality of the main meal consumed by adults in Brazil and UK. Food record data was obtained from representative samples from UK and Brazil databases. The Main Meal Quality Index (MMQI) was applied to estimate the quality of the main meal consumed in Brazil and UK. Differences in food groups consumed in the main meal in Brazil and UK were observed using classification decision tree. Meals with higher average energy content were lunch for Brazil, and dinner for the UK. On average, the Brazilian main meal had better nutritional quality (4.42 times higher), independently of sex, age, family income, nutritional status and energy consumed, with higher scores of fiber, carbohydrate, total fat, saturated fat and energy density. However, UK's main meal included more fruits and vegetables. Food preparations combined with rice and beans were classified as Brazilian main meal, while combinations with fast food items, as fried potatoes, sandwiches and sugary beverages, were classified as UK main meals. In Brazil, the main meal quality was lower among women and obese individuals, presenting significant positive association with age, and negative association with energy intake and family income; while in UK, only age was positively associated with MMQI. Although main meals in Brazil had higher nutritional quality compared to the UK, main meals consumed in both countries need nutritional improvement."

Fifty epididymis were flushed with a skim milk based extender with or without PTX. The pre-treatment with PTX enhanced the sperm motility after being harvested (P<0.05); however the freeze-thaw process did not alter the sperm kinematics between control and treated samples (P>0.05). Plasma membrane integrity did not differ between control and PTX group after recovery and after thawing (P>0.05), as observed in tyrosine phosphorylation, which the PTX treatment did not alter the percentage of tail-associated immunofluorescence of cryopreserved epididymal sperm (P>0.05). For the fertility trial, different insemination groups were tested: 800\u00d7106 epididymal sperm (C800); 100\u00d7106 epididymal sperm (C100); 100\u00d7106 epididymal sperm recovered in an extender containing PTX (PTX100). The conception rates for C800; C100 and PTX100 were 68.7% (11/16); 31.5% (5/16) and 50% (8/16), respectively. The conception rate did not differ among groups (P>0.05), however, a low number of animals was used in this study. A trend toward significance (P=0.07) was observed between C800 and C100 groups. In conclusion, PTX has no deleterious effect on sperm motility, viability and capacitation of cryopreserved stallion epididymal sperm. The conventional artificial insemination with 100\u00d7106 sperm recovered with PTX ensures acceptable conception rates and maximize the limited number of doses of cryopreserved stallion epididymal sperm."

  "description": "Identification of Three Early Phases of Cell-Fate Determination during Osteogenic and Adipogenic Differentiation by Transcription Factor DynamicsAge-related skeletal degeneration in patients with osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone mass and occurs concomitant with an increase in bone marrow adipocytes. Using microarray expression profiling with high temporal resolution, we identified gene regulatory events in early stages of osteogenic and adipogenic lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Data analysis revealed three distinct phases when cells adopt a committed expression phenotype: initiation of differentiation (0\u20133hr, phase I), lineage acquisition (6\u201324hr, phase II), and early lineage progression (48\u201396hr, phase III). Upstream regulator analysis identified 34 transcription factors (TFs) in phase I with a role in hMSC differentiation. Interestingly, expression levels of identified TFs did not always change and indicate additional post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Functional analysis revealed that forced expression of IRF2 enhances osteogenic differentiation. Thus, IRF2 and other early-responder TFs may control osteogenic cell fate of MSCs and should be considered in mechanistic models that clarify bone-anabolic changes during clinical progression of osteoporosis."

To understand the role of DNA methylation in these effects, we used zebrafish as a vertebrate model to investigate heritable changes in DNA methylation following chemical-induced stress during early development. We exposed zebrafish embryos to non-embryotoxic concentrations of the biologically active phthalate metabolite mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, 30 \u03bcM) and the DNA methyltransferase 1 inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5AC, 10 \u03bcM). Direct, latent and transgenerational effects on DNA methylation were assessed using global, genome-wide and locus-specific DNA methylation analyses. Results: Following direct exposure in zebrafish embryos from 0 to 6 days post-fertilization, genome-wide analysis revealed a multitude of differentially methylated regions, strongly enriched at conserved non-genic elements for both compounds. Pathways involved in adipogenesis were enriched with the putative obesogenic compound MEHP. Exposure to 5AC resulted in enrichment of pathways involved in embryonic development and transgenerational effects on larval body length. Locus-specific methylation analysis of 10 differentially methylated sites revealed six of these loci differentially methylated in sperm sampled from adult zebrafish exposed during development to 5AC, and in first and second generation larvae. With MEHP, consistent changes were found at 2 specific loci in first and second generation larvae. Conclusions: Our results suggest a functional role for DNA methylation on cis-regulatory conserved elements following developmental exposure to compounds. Effects on these regions are potentially transferred to subsequent generations."

  "description": "Systems Toxicology: Real World Applications and OpportunitiesSystems Toxicology aims to change the basis of how adverse biological effects of xenobiotics are characterized from empirical end points to describing modes of action as adverse outcome pathways and perturbed networks. Toward this aim, Systems Toxicology entails the integration of in vitro and in vivo toxicity data with computational modeling. This evolving approach depends critically on data reliability and relevance, which in turn depends on the quality of experimental models and bioanalysis techniques used to generate toxicological data. Systems Toxicology involves the use of large-scale data streams (\"big data\"), such as those derived from omics measurements that require computational means for obtaining informative results. Thus, integrative analysis of multiple molecular measurements, particularly acquired by omics strategies, is a key approach in Systems Toxicology. In recent years, there have been significant advances centered on in vitro test systems and bioanalytical strategies, yet a frontier challenge concerns linking observed network perturbations to phenotypes, which will require understanding pathways and networks that give rise to adverse responses. This summary perspective from a 2016 Systems Toxicology meeting, an international conference held in the Alps of Switzerland, describes the limitations and opportunities of selected emerging applications in this rapidly advancing field. Systems Toxicology aims to change the basis of how adverse biological effects of xenobiotics are characterized, from empirical end points to pathways of toxicity. This requires the integration of in vitro and in vivo data with computational modeling. Test systems and bioanalytical technologies have made significant advances, but ensuring data reliability and relevance is an ongoing concern. The major challenge facing the new pathway approach is determining how to link observed network perturbations to phenotypic toxicity."

  "description": "The peculiar glycolytic pathway in hyperthermophylic archaea: Understanding its whims by experimentation in silicoMathematical models are key to systems biology where they typically describe the topology and dynamics of biological networks, listing biochemical entities and their relationships with one another. Some (hyper)thermophilic Archaea contain an enzyme, called non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN), which catalyzes the direct oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate omitting adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) formation by substrate-level-phosphorylation via phosphoglycerate kinase. In this study we formulate three hypotheses that could explain functionally why GAPN exists in these Archaea, and then construct and use mathematical models to test these three hypotheses. We used kinetic parameters of enzymes of Sulfolobus solfataricus (S. solfataricus) which is a thermo-acidophilic archaeon that grows optimally between 60 and 90 \u00b0C and between pH 2 and 4. For comparison, we used a model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae), an organism that can live at moderate temperatures. We find that both the first hypothesis, i.e., that the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) plus phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) route (the alternative to GAPN) is thermodynamically too much uphill and the third hypothesis, i.e., that GAPDH plus PGK are required to carry the flux in the gluconeogenic direction, are correct. The second hypothesis, i.e., that the GAPDH plus PGK route delivers less than the 1 ATP per pyruvate that is delivered by the GAPN route, is only correct when GAPDH reaction has a high rate and 1,3-bis-phosphoglycerate (BPG) spontaneously degrades to 3PG at a high rate."

  "description": "Using zebrafish to assess developmental neurotoxicityIt is widely accepted that the developing nervous system is especially vulnerable to a variety of chemicals, including drugs and environmental contaminants. It is also clear that our understanding of the risks from chemical exposures during development is rudimentary, and that the resources for remedying the situation are legion. As a result, increasing attention is directed toward alternative test methods including in vitro preparations, computational (in silico) models, and in vivo model (or alternative) organisms. In particular, zebrafish have become a popular test species in toxicology, pharmacology, and biomedical research. In this chapter, we review several issues, results, and research needs regarding the use of zebrafish to assess developmental neurotoxicity. Considerable advances have been made in understanding the basic biology of nervous system development in zebrafish, in techniques for rapidly evaluating the effect of chemical exposures on nervous system development, and, notably, to a lesser extent, in understanding the significance of results for predicting human effects. This chapter was written as an introduction to the use of zebrafish in developmental neurotoxicology, and to encourage the use of this model either for screening or mechanistic purposes. We have endeavored to make the reader aware of significant research findings, and to offer a balanced view of the advantages and limitations in using zebrafish as a model for investigating developmental neurotoxicity."

Our analyses shed light on how the molecular-recognition machinery behind life's genetic code depends on the medium, in order to contribute to our understanding of the possibility or impossibility for life to exist on exoplanetary bodies. Calculations show how a common non-terran environment like ammonia, less polar than water, exhibits stronger hydrogen-bonding affinities, although showing reduced selectivities towards the correct incorporation of Watson-Crick base pairs into the backbone. Thus, we prove the viability of DNA replication in a non-terran environment."

  "description": "4-Hydroxypiperidines and their flexible 3-(amino)propyloxy analogues as non-imidazole histamine H3 receptor antagonist: Further structure-activity relationship exploration and in vitro and in vivo pharmacological evaluationPresynaptic histamine H3 receptors (H3R) act as auto- or heteroreceptors controlling, respectively, the release of histamine and of other neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS). The extracellular levels of several neurotransmitters are enhanced by H3R antagonists, and there is a great interest for potent, brain-penetrating H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists to compensate for the neurotransmitter deficits present in various neurological disorders. We have shown that 1-[(benzylfuran-2-yl)methyl]piperidinyl-4-oxyl- and benzyl- derivatives of N-propylpentan-1-amines exhibit high in vitro potencies toward the guinea pig H3 receptor (jejunum), with pA2 = 8.47 and 7.79, respectively (the reference compound used was thioperamide with pA2 = 8.67). Furthermore, following the replacement of 4-hydroxypiperidine with a 3-(methylamino)propyloxy chain, the pA2 value for the first group decreased, whereas it increased for the second group. Here, we present data on the impact of elongating the aliphatic chain between the nitrogen of 4-hydroxypiperidine or 3-(methylamino)propan-1-ol and the lipophilic residue. Additionally, the most active compound in this series of non-imidazole H3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists, i.e., ADS-003, was evaluated for its affinity to the recombinant rat and human histamine H3 receptors transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells. It was shown that ADS-003, given parenterally for 5 days, reduced the food intake of rats, as well as changed histamine and noradrenaline concentrations in the rats\u2019 brain in a manner and degree similar to the reference H3 antagonist Ciproxifan."

  "description": "Determinants of a dietary pattern linked with greater metabolic risk and its tracking during adolescenceBackground: Although growing evidence suggests that dietary patterns associated with noncommunicable diseases in adulthood may develop early in life, when these are established, as well as their determinants, remains unclear. Methods: We examined determinants and tracking of a dietary pattern (DP) associated with metabolic risk and its key food groups among 860 adolescents in the Western Australian Pregnancy (Raine) Cohort study. Food intake was reported using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at 14 and 17years. Z-scores for an \u2018energy-dense, high-fat, low-fibre\u2019 DP were estimated by applying reduced rank regression at both ages. Tracking was based on the predictive value (PV) of remaining in the DPZ-score or food intake quartile at 14 and 17years. Early-life exposures included: maternal age; maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index; parent smoking status during pregnancy; and parent socio-economic position (SEP) at 14 and 17years. Associations between the DPZ-scores, early-life factors and SEP were analysed using regression analysis. Results: Dietary tracking was strongest among boys with high DPZ-scores, high intakes of processed meat, low-fibre bread, crisps and savoury snacks (PV>1) and the lowest intakes of vegetables, fruit and legumes. Lower maternal education (\u03b2=0.09, P=0.002 at 14years; \u03b2=0.14, P<0.001 at 17years) and lower maternal age at birth (\u03b2=0.09, P=0.003 at 14years; \u03b2=0.11, P=0.004 at 17years) were positively associated with higher DPZ-scores. Conclusions: An energy-dense, high-fat, low-fibre dietary pattern tracks more strongly among adolescent boys who have high scores for this pattern at 14years of age. These findings highlight target foods and population subgroups for early interventions aiming to improve dietary behaviours."

  "description": "Display of recombinant proteins on bacterial outer membrane vesicles by using protein ligationThe Escherichia coli virulence factor hemoglobin protease (Hbp) has been engineered into a surface display system that can be expressed to high density on live E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium cells or derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Multiple antigenic sequences can be genetically fused into the Hbp core structure for optimal exposure to the immune system. Although the Hbp display platform is relatively tolerant, increasing the number, size, and complexity of integrated sequences generally lowers the expression of the fused constructs and limits the density of display. This is due to the intricate mechanism of Hbp secretion across the outer membrane and the efficient quality control of translocation-incompetent chimeric Hbp molecules in the periplasm. To address this shortcoming, we explored the coupling of purified proteins to the Hbp carrier after its translocation across the outer membrane using the recently developed SpyTag/ SpyCatcher protein ligation system. As expected, fusion of the small SpyTag to Hbp did not hamper display on OMVs. Subsequent addition of purified proteins fused to the SpyCatcher domain resulted in efficient covalent coupling to Hbp-SpyTag. Using in addition the orthogonal SnoopTag/SnoopCatcher system, multiple antigen modules could be coupled to Hbp in a sequential ligation strategy. Not only antigens proved suitable for Spy-mediated ligation but also nanobodies. Addition of this functionality to the platform might allow the targeting of live bacterial or OMV vaccines to certain tissues or immune cells to tailor immune responses."

  "description": "Microplastics contamination in molluscs from the northern part of the Persian GulfMicroplastics (MPs) are well-known emerging contaminants in the marine environment. A key route by which MPs can directly affect marine life is through ingestion. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of MPs in marine life and seafood for human consumption in the Persian Gulf. We conducted a whole body analysis of MP (between 10 and 5000 \u03bcm in diameter) abundance in five species of molluscs with different feeding strategies, including both gastropods and bivalves from the littoral zone of the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf. The mean number of total encountered MPs in all species ranged from 0.2 to 21.0 particles per g of soft tissue (wet weight) and from 3.7 to 17.7 particles per individual. Overall, microfibres followed by fragments were the most common type of MP isolated in each species (respectively > 50% and \u224826%). Film (\u224814%) and pellets (\u22482%) were less commonly observed. The observed MPs were classified into three size groups (ca. 10\u201325 \u03bcm, 25\u2013250 \u03bcm and 250\u20135000 \u03bcm), and 37\u201358% of MPs fell into the smallest size group. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis confirmed the presence of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and nylon (PA). Our results indicated that molluscan shellfish from the Persian Gulf contain MPs, with higher concentrations in a predatory species, suggesting trophic transfer of MPs in the food web. The consumption of edible species may be a source of human microplastic intake. We compared our results with those previously reported for other regions of the world and identified the need for further studies in the Persian Gulf."

  "description": "The Arabidopsis GORK K+-channel is phosphorylated by calcium-dependent protein kinase 21 (CPK21), which in turn is activated by 14-3-3 proteinsPotassium (K+) is a vital ion for many processes in the plant and fine-tuned ion channels control the K+-fluxes across the plasma membrane. GORK is an outward-rectifying K+-channel with important functions in stomatal closure and in root K+-homeostasis. In this study, post-translational modification of the Arabidopsis GORK ion channel and its regulation by 14-3-3 proteins was investigated. To investigate the possible interaction between GORK and 14-3-3s an in vivo pull-down from an Arabidopsis protein extract with recombinant GORK C-terminus (GORK-C) indeed identified endogenous 14-3-3s (LAMBDA, CHI, NU) as binding partners in a phosphorylation dependent manner. However, a direct interaction between 14-3-3's and GORK-C could not be demonstrated. Since the pull-down of 14-3-3s was phosphorylation dependent, we determined GORK-C as substrate for CPK21 phosphorylation and identified three CPK21 phospho-sites in the GORK protein (T344, S518 and S649). Moreover, interaction of 14-3-3 to CPK21 strongly stimulates its kinase activity; an effect that can result in increased GORK phosphorylation and change in activity. Using the non-invasive vibrating probe technique, we measured the predominantly GORK mediated salt induced K+-efflux from wild-type, gork, cpk21, aha2 and 14-3-3 mutant roots. The mutants cpk21 and aha2 did not show statistical significant differences compared to WT. However, two (out of six) 14-3-3 isoforms, CHI and PHI, have a clear function in the salt induced K+-efflux. In conclusion, our results show that GORK can be phosphorylated by CPK21 and suggest that 14-3-3 proteins control GORK activity through binding with and activation of CPK21."

  "description": "High-Throughput Effect-Directed Analysis Using Downscaled in Vitro Reporter Gene Assays to Identify Endocrine Disruptors in Surface WaterEffect-directed analysis (EDA) is a commonly used approach for effect-based identification of endocrine disruptive chemicals in complex (environmental) mixtures. However, for routine toxicity assessment of, for example, water samples, current EDA approaches are considered time-consuming and laborious. We achieved faster EDA and identification by downscaling of sensitive cell-based hormone reporter gene assays and increasing fractionation resolution to allow testing of smaller fractions with reduced complexity. The high-resolution EDA approach is demonstrated by analysis of four environmental passive sampler extracts. Downscaling of the assays to a 384-well format allowed analysis of 64 fractions in triplicate (or 192 fractions without technical replicates) without affecting sensitivity compared to the standard 96-well format. Through a parallel exposure method, agonistic and antagonistic androgen and estrogen receptor activity could be measured in a single experiment following a single fractionation. From 16 selected candidate compounds, identified through nontargeted analysis, 13 could be confirmed chemically and 10 were found to be biologically active, of which the most potent nonsteroidal estrogens were identified as oxybenzone and piperine. The increased fractionation resolution and the higher throughput that downscaling provides allow for future application in routine high-resolution screening of large numbers of samples in order to accelerate identification of (emerging) endocrine disruptors."

  "description": "Low affinity uniporter carrier proteins can increase net substrate uptake rate by reducing effluxMany organisms have several similar transporters with different affinities for the same substrate. Typically, high-affinity transporters are expressed when substrate is scarce and low-affinity ones when it is abundant. The benefit of using low instead of high-affinity transporters remains unclear, especially when additional nutrient sensors are present. Here, we investigate two hypotheses. It was previously hypothesized that there is a trade-off between the affinity and the catalytic efficiency of transporters, and we find some but no definitive support for it. Additionally, we propose that for uptake by facilitated diffusion, at saturating substrate concentrations, lowering the affinity enhances the net uptake rate by reducing substrate efflux. As a consequence, there exists an optimal, external-substrate-concentration dependent transporter affinity. A computational model of Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycolysis shows that using the low affinity HXT3 transporter instead of the high affinity HXT6 enhances the steady-state flux by 36%. We tried to test this hypothesis with yeast strains expressing a single glucose transporter modified to have either a high or a low affinity. However, due to the intimate link between glucose perception and metabolism, direct experimental proof for this hypothesis remained inconclusive. Still, our theoretical results provide a novel reason for the presence of low-affinity transport systems."

The reaction of 2 with an equimolar amount of the sulfur-based complex (Me2S)AuCl resulted in displacement of the SMe2 ligand and formation of linear phosphine gold(I) chloride 3. Using an excess of ligand 2, bisligated complex 4 was formed and showed dynamic behavior at room temperature. Changing the gold(I) metal precursor to the phosphorus-based complex, (Ph3P)AuCl impacted the coordination behavior of ligand 2. Namely, the reaction of ligand 2 with (Ph3P)AuCl led to the heterolytic cleavage of the gold-chloride bond, which is favored over PPh3 ligand displacement. To the best of our knowledge, 2 is the first example of a P/B-ambiphilic ligand capable of cleaving the gold-chloride bond. The coordination chemistry of 2 was further analyzed by density functional theory calculations."

We show that electron-phonon interactions can explain the large thermal broadening and fast carrier cooling rates experimentally observed in Pb-chalcogenide NCs. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that electron-phonon interactions are suppressed in halide-terminated NCs due to reduction of both the thermal displacement of surface atoms and the spatial overlap of the charge carriers with these large atomic vibrations. This work shows how surface engineering, guided by simulations, can be used to systematically control carrier dynamics."

  "description": "Glucose-nucleobase pairs within DNA: Impact of hydrophobicity, alternative linking unit and DNA polymerase nucleotide insertion studiesRecently, we studied glucose-nucleobase pairs, a binding motif found in aminoglycoside-RNA recognition. DNA duplexes with glucose as a nucleobase were able to hybridize and were selective for purines. They were less stable than natural DNA but still fit well on regular B-DNA. These results opened up the possible use of glucose as a non-aromatic DNA base mimic. Here, we have studied the incorporation and thermal stability of glucose with different types of anchoring units and alternative apolar sugar-nucleobase pairs. When we explored butanetriol instead of glycerol as a wider anchoring unit, we did not gain duplex thermal stability. This result confirmed the necessity of a more conformationally restricted linker to increase the overall duplex stability. Permethylated glucose-nucleobase pairs showed similar stability to glucoside-nucleobase pairs but no selectivity for a specific nucleobase, possibly due to the absence of hydrogen bonds between them. The three-dimensional structure of the duplex solved by NMR located both, the hydrophobic permethylated glucose and the nucleobase, inside the DNA helix as in the case of glucose-nucleobase pairs. Quantum chemical calculations on glucose-nucleobase pairs indicate that the attachment of the sugar to the DNA skeleton through the OH1 or OH4 positions yields the highest binding energies. Moreover, glucose was very selective for guanine when attached through OH1 or OH4 to the DNA. Finally, we examined DNA polymerase insertion of nucleotides in front of the saccharide unit. KF- polymerase from E. coli inserted A and G opposite glc and 6dglc with low efficiency but notable selectivity. It is even capable of extending the new pair although its efficiency depended on the DNA sequence. In contrast, Bst 2.0, SIII and BIOTAQ\u2122 DNA polymerases seem to display a loop-out mechanism possibly due to the flexible glycerol linker used instead of deoxyribose."

  "description": "Angular scanning and variable wavelength surface plasmon resonance allowing free sensor surface selection for optimum material- and bio-sensingA variable-wavelength Kretschmann configuration surface plasmon resonance (SPR) apparatus with angle scanning is presented. The setup provides the possibility of selecting the optimum wavelength with respect to the properties of the metal layer of the sensorchip, sample matrix, and biomolecular interaction of interest. Monitoring SPR curves over a wide angular range (39\u00b0) permits simultaneous determination of the total internal reflection angle (TIR), the resonance angle, and the intensity and width of the SPR dip, which are essential parameters for measuring binding events and achieving optimum sensitivity. The new apparatus was evaluated by recording full SPR curves at different wavelengths ranging from 600 to 890 nm using sensor surfaces of silver, gold and gold with deposited silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide and indium tin oxide which were exposed to air and an aqueous solution of sodium chloride. Clear wavelength dependencies of sensor-material resonance angles and SPR-dip widths were demonstrated. In order to investigate the capability of the system to probe molecular binding to different sensor surfaces, the layer-by-layer adsorption of charged polyelectrolytes was monitored in angular scanning mode at 600, 670, 785, and 890 nm. Although at longer wavelengths lower angular shifts were observed as result of layer deposition, the sharper dip, wider detection window and better signal-to-noise ratios at these wavelengths can be beneficial for binding studies. The applicability for biosensing was tested by immobilizing human serum albumin (HSA) on an aluminum-oxide-coated gold sensor using a new procedure and measuring the binding of anti-HSA antibodies at the optimal wavelength (890 nm) in angular-scanning and fixed-angle mode. The HSA biosensor showed negligible non-specific interaction and yielded almost ten times better sensitivity than obtained with a conventional gold-dextran-based sensor operated at 670/785 nm. Analysis of anti-HSA samples pre-incubated with different concentrations of HSA allowed measurement of the IC50 value. The reported data demonstrate the usefulness of the presented variable-wavelength angle-scanning SPR instrument, permitting continuous recording of full SPR curves in time at any selected wavelength in the 600\u2013890 nm range using a sensor material of choice."

  "description": "Uptake of pharmaceuticals by sorbent-amended struvite fertilisers recovered from human urine and their bioaccumulation in tomato fruitStruvite precipitation is a well-documented method for recovering up to 98% of phosphorus from urine, which is one of the main nutrients in fertilizers besides nitrogen and potassium. Shortcomings of this process, however, are the low nitrogen recovery ratio and the possible uptake of pharmaceuticals from urine. In this work, the NH4                             + adsorbent materials biochar and zeolite are coupled with struvite precipitation to increase the N-recovery of struvite from 5.7% to 9.8%. Since nitrogen is one of the main nutrients in fertilisers, this increase is of significance for its potential commercial use. In addition, urine is spiked with pharmaceuticals to measure the consequential uptake in struvite-based fertilisers and crops afterwards. Five fertilisers are prepared by nutrient recovery from spiked urine using: (1) struvite crystallisation, (2) struvite crystallisation combined with N adsorption on zeolite, (3) struvite crystallisation combined with N adsorption on biochar, (4) N adsorption on zeolite without struvite crystallisation, and (5) N adsorption on biochar without struvite crystallisation. The fertiliser with the highest purity product and the lowest uptake of pharmaceuticals was struvite combined with zeolite. Next, the contaminated struvite-sorbent fertilisers are tested in a crop trial in which the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in edible plant tissue (tomatoes) is measured. This bioaccumulation in tomato fruit biomass from each of the spiked fertilisers in the crop trial was found to be lower than 0.0003% in all cases, far below the acceptable daily intake (ADI) levels (750 kg of dry tomatoes should be consumed per day to reach the ADI limit). Consequently, the subsequent risk to human health from tomato fruit grown using urine derived struvite-sorbent fertilisers is found to be insignificant."

  "description": "Nucleophilic Substitution in Solution: Activation Strain Analysis of Weak and Strong Solvent EffectsWe have quantum chemically studied the effect of various polar and apolar solvents on the shape of the potential energy surface (PES) of a diverse collection of archetypal nucleophilic substitution reactions at carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and arsenic by using density functional theory at the OLYP/TZ2P level. In the gas phase, all our model SN2 reactions have single-well PESs, except for the nucleophilic substitution reaction at carbon (SN2@C), which has a double-well energy profile. The presence of the solvent can have a significant effect on the shape of the PES and, thus, on the nature of the SN2 process. Solvation energies, charges on the nucleophile or leaving group, and structural features are compared for the various SN2 reactions in a spectrum of solvents. We demonstrate how solvation can change the shape of the PES, depending not only on the polarity of the solvent, but also on how the charge is distributed over the interacting molecular moieties during different stages of the reaction. In the case of a nucleophilic substitution at three-coordinate phosphorus, the reaction can be made to proceed through a single-well [no transition state (TS)], bimodal barrier (two TSs), and then through a unimodal transition state (one TS) simply by increasing the polarity of the solvent."

Glutathione conjugation protects against AQ-induced toxicity and GSTP1 is able to conjugate its quinoneimine metabolites AQ-QI and DEA-QI with glutathione. In this study, HepG2 cells transiently transfected with the human GSTP1 construct were utilized to investigate the protective effect of GSTP1 in a cellular context. HepG2 cells were exposed to synthesized QIs, which bypasses the need for intracellular bioactivation of AQ or DEAQ. Exposure was accompanied by decreased cell viability, increased caspase 3 activity, and decreased intracellular GSH levels. Using high-content imaging-based BAC-GFP reporters, it was shown that AQ-QI and DEAQ-QI specifically activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. In contrast, oxidative stress, DNA damage, or inflammatory stress responses were not activated. Overexpression of GSTP1 resulted in a two-fold increase in GSH-conjugation of the QIs, attenuated QI-induced cytotoxicity especially under GSH-depletion condition, abolished QIs-induced apoptosis but did not significantly inhibit the activation of the ER stress response. In conclusion, these results indicate a protective role of GSTP1 by increasing enzymatic detoxification of AQ-QI and DEAQ-QI and suggest a second protective mechanism by interfering with ER stress induced apoptosis."

  "description": "The paraspecific neutralisation of snake venom induced coagulopathy by antivenomsSnake envenoming causes several potentially lethal pathologies. The specific pathology is dictated by the toxin composition of venom, which varies by species, geography and ontogeny. This variation severely restricts the paraspecific efficacy of antivenoms used to treat snakebite victims. With a view to devising pathology-specific snakebite treatments, we assessed the procoagulant activity of 57 snake venoms and investigated the efficacy of various antivenoms. We find that procoagulant venoms act differentially on key steps of the coagulation cascade, and that certain monospecific antivenoms work in a previously unrecognised paraspecific manner to neutralise this activity, despite conventional assumptions of congener-restricted efficacy. Moreover, we demonstrate that the metal chelator EDTA is also capable of neutralising venom-induced lethality in vivo. This study illustrates the exciting potential of developing new, broad-spectrum, toxin-targeting antivenoms capable of treating key snakebite pathologies, and advocates a thorough re-examination of enzyme inhibiting compounds as alternative therapies for treating snakebite victims."

  "description": "The constitutive activity of the virally encoded chemokine receptor US28 accelerates glioblastoma growthGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and an incurable type of brain cancer. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA and encoded proteins, including the chemokine receptor US28, have been detected in GBM tumors. US28 displays constitutive activity and is able to bind several human chemokines, leading to the activation of various proliferative and inflammatory signaling pathways. Here we show that HCMV, through the expression of US28, significantly enhanced the growth of 3D spheroids of U251\u2212 and neurospheres of primary glioblastoma cells. Moreover, US28 expression accelerated the growth of glioblastoma cells in an orthotopic intracranial GBM-model in mice. We developed highly potent and selective US28-targeting nanobodies, which bind to the extracellular domain of US28 and detect US28 in GBM tissue. The nanobodies inhibited chemokine binding and reduced the constitutive US28-mediated signaling with nanomolar potencies and significantly impaired HCMV/US28-mediated tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. This study emphasizes the oncomodulatory role of HCMV-encoded US28 and provides a potential therapeutic approach for HCMV-positive tumors using the nanobody technology."

  "description": "Mechanistic considerations for reduced endometrial cancer risk by smokingThis review provides mechanistic explanations on why smoking reduces endometrial cancer risk with the primary focus on polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs from cigarette smoke can activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor\u2013mediated pathways. This leads to (i) increased levels of anticarcinogenic metabolites of estradiol, (ii) suppression of estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013mediated actions, and (iii) induction of endometrial apoptosis. In addition, hydroxylated metabolites of PAHs may also evoke antitumor effects via the ER, specifically ER\u03b2. The nuclear receptor expression profile in the human endometrium continuously changes throughout the menstrual cycle. In addition, endometrial apoptosis plays a fundamental role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle. The dynamic ER, progesterone receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor expression together with the importance of apoptosis in the human endometrium likely explains the anticarcinogenic effect of PAHs from smoking on the endometrium as opposed to that on the mammary gland."

  "description": "Occurrence of legacy and alternative plasticizers in indoor dust from various EU countries and implications for human exposure via dust ingestion and dermal absorptionPlasticizers are a category of chemicals extensively used in consumer products and, consequently, their presence is ubiquitous in the indoor environment. In the present study, an analytical method has been developed for the quantification of plasticizers (7 legacy phthalate esters (LPEs) and 14 alternative plasticizers (APs)) in indoor floor dust based on ultrasonic and vortex extraction, Florisil fractionation and GC-(EI)-MS analysis. Dust samples (n = 54) were collected from homes, offices, and daycare centers from different EU countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and Sweden). Method LOQs ranged from 0.2 to 5 \u03bcg/g. Tri-n-hexyl trimellitate (THTM) was not detected in any sample, whereas dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diphenyl phthalate and acetyl triethyl citrate (ATEC) were detected only in 6, 2 and 1 out of 54 samples, respectively. The highest concentrations of plasticizers were measured in Swedish offices, at a mean concentration of total plasticizers of 1800 \u03bcg/g, followed by Swedish daycare centers at 1200 and 670 \u03bcg/g for winter and spring sampling, respectively. Generally, the contribution of APs was slightly higher than for LPEs for all indoor environments (mean contribution 60% and 40%, respectively based on contributions per indoor environment). For the APs, main contributors were DINP in Belgian homes (28%), Swedish offices (60%), Swedish daycare centers (48%), and Dutch offices (31%) and DEHT in Belgian (28%), Irish (40%) and Dutch homes (37%) of total APs. The predominant LPE was bis-2-ethylhexyl-phthalate (DEHP) with a mean contribution varying from 60% to 85% of total LPEs. Human exposure was evaluated for dust ingestion and dermal absorption using hazard quotients (HQs) of plasticizers (ratio between average daily doses and the reference dose). None of the HQs of plasticizers exceeded 1, meaning that the risk for adverse human health effects from these plasticizers via dust ingestion and dermal absorption is unlikely."

Of the tested compounds, 171 (64%) displayed selective in vitro activity, with 16 causing worm hypermotility/spastic contractions and 41 inducing various degrees of worm killing at 100 \u03bcM, with the surviving worms displaying sluggish movement, worm unpairing and complete absence of eggs. The compounds that did not affect worm viability (n = 72) induced a complete cessation of ovipositing. 82% of the compounds had an impact on male worms whereas female worms were barely affected. In vivo evaluation in S. mansoni-infected mice with the in vitro \u2018hit\u2019 NPD-0274 at 20 mg/kg/day orally for 5 days resulted in worm burden reductions of 29% and intestinal tissue egg load reduction of 35% at 10 days post-treatment. Combination of praziquantel (PZQ) at 10 mg/kg/day for 5 days with NPD-0274 or NPD-0298 resulted in significantly higher worm killing than PZQ alone, as well as a reduction in intestinal tissue egg load, disappearance of immature eggs and an increase in the number of dead eggs."

  "description": "A genome-scale metabolic network of the aroma bacterium Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremorisLeuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris is an obligate heterolactic fermentative lactic acid bacterium that is mostly used in industrial dairy fermentations. The phosphoketolase pathway (PKP) is a unique feature of the obligate heterolactic fermentation, which leads to the production of lactate, ethanol, and/or acetate, and the final product profile of PKP highly depends on the energetics and redox state of the organism. Another characteristic of the L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris is the production of aroma compounds in dairy fermentation, such as in cheese production, through the utilization of citrate. Considering its importance in dairy fermentation, a detailed metabolic characterization of the organism is necessary for its more efficient use in the industry. To this aim, a genome-scale metabolic model of dairy-origin L. mesenteroides subsp. cremoris ATCC 19254 (iLM.c559) was reconstructed to explain the energetics and redox state mechanisms of the organism in full detail. The model includes 559 genes governing 1088 reactions between 1129 metabolites, and the reactions cover citrate utilization and citrate-related flavor metabolism. The model was validated by simulating co-metabolism of glucose and citrate and comparing the in silico results to our experimental results. Model simulations further showed that, in co-metabolism of citrate and glucose, no flavor compounds were produced when citrate could stimulate the formation of biomass. Significant amounts of flavor metabolites (e.g., diacetyl and acetoin) were only produced when citrate could not enhance growth, which suggests that flavor formation only occurs under carbon and ATP excess. The effects of aerobic conditions and different carbon sources on product profiles and growth were also investigated using the reconstructed model. The analyses provided further insights for the growth stimulation and flavor formation mechanisms of the organism."

  "description": "Nanobodies detecting and modulating GPCRs outside in and inside outG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), belonging to the largest class of membrane proteins, play a prominent role in many (patho)physiological processes and are, therefore, important drug targets. Although most often targeted by small molecules, these receptors have become interesting targets for antibodies and antibody fragments, especially camelid-derived heavy chain-only antibodies and fragments thereof (nanobodies). The small size and molecular structure of nanobodies allow GPCR-binding and modulation, from both the intracellular and extracellular sides. These molecular features make nanobodies attractive tools to study, modulate, and exploit GPCRs. Besides modulating GPCR activity as monovalent or multivalent constructs, nanobodies can also be functionalized for imaging and therapy. Moreover, GPCR-binding nanobodies have been instrumental in obtaining crystal structures of GPCRs, facilitating structure-based drug discovery. Here, we describe the current status and future perspectives of nanobodies targeting GPCRs intra and extracellularly."

Limited information is available on the occurrence of this PFOA substitute. In this pilot study, we investigated the presence of GenX in/on grass and leaf samples collected near a fluoropolymer manufacturing plant in the Netherlands and in drinking water produced from surface and surface-water influenced groundwater intake points within 25\u202fkm from the plant. GenX was detected in/on all grass and leaf samples collected within 3\u202fkm north-east from the plant, with levels ranging from 1 to 27\u202fng/g wet weight (ww) and 4.3-86\u202fng/g ww, respectively. The PFOA levels in/on grass and leaves were lower, ranging from 0.7 to 11\u202fng/g ww and 0.9-28\u202fng/g ww, respectively. A declining concentration gradient of GenX and PFOA with increasing distance from the plant was observed, which suggests that the plant is a point source of GenX and was a point source for PFOA in the past. In all drinking water samples, GenX and PFOA were detected with levels ranging from 1.4 to 8.0\u202fng/L and 1.9-7.1\u202fng/L, respectively. The detection of GenX, which is only used since 2012, in/on grass and leaves and in drinking water indicates that GenX is now distributed through the environment. The presence of GenX and PFOA in/on grass and leaves within 3\u202fkm north-east of the plant also suggests that these chemicals could also be present on the locally grown food in gardens around the factory."

  "description": "Influence of Scalar-Relativistic and Spin-Orbit Terms on the Plasmonic Properties of Pure and Silver-Doped Gold ChainsThe unique plasmonic character of silver and gold nanoparticles has a wide range of applications, and tailoring this property by changing electronic and geometric structures has received a great deal of attention. Herein, we study the role of the quantum properties in controlling the plasmonic excitations of gold and silver atomic chains and rods. The influence of relativistic effects, scalar as well as spin-orbit, on the intensity and energy of plasmonic excitations is investigated. The intensity quenching and the red shift of energy in the presence of relativistic effects are introduced via the appearance of d orbitals directly in optical excitations in addition to the screening of s-electrons by mixing with the occupied orbitals. For the linear gold system, it will be demonstrated that by increasing the length the relativistic behavior declines and the contribution of d orbitals to the plasmonic excitations evidently decreases. Furthermore, silver atoms are doped in gold chains and rods (with two different arrangements) to realize how gold-silver interactions decrease the relativistic effects and enhance the intensity of collective excitations. Finally, to strengthen the plasmonic behavior of gold, the elongation of chain and doping with suitable atoms such as silver (with the classical plasmonic behavior) can be introduced as the manipulating ways to control the influence of scalar-relativistic and spin-orbit effects and, consequently, reinforce the plasmonic properties."

Although information regarding their signaling properties is starting to emerge, the structural motifs and interaction networks that determine 7 transmembrane (TM) signaling of class B2 GPCRs remain to be elucidated. Comparative sequence-structure analyses of class B2 GPCRs and the recently solved active class B1 structures show that class B2 GPCRs include different elements of the conserved residue motifs that determine class B1 activation. Combined site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics studies were performed to give detailed insights into the role of 7TM interaction networks in signaling of two representative class B2 receptors, ADGRG1 (GPR56) and ADGRL4 (ELTD1). The systematic investigation of class B1/B2 sequence motifs provides consistent structure-function relationships that can be translated to the whole class B2 GPCR family and suggests that class B1 and B2 GPCRs share conserved intramolecular 7TM interactions. This improved understanding in adhesion GPCR structure and constitutive signaling can accelerate drug design campaigns for this chemically unexplored receptor class."

  "description": "Ranking network mechanisms by how they fit diverse experiments and deciding on E. coli's ammonium transport and assimilation networkThe complex ammonium transport and assimilation network of E. coli involves the ammonium transporter AmtB, the regulatory proteins GlnK and GlnB, and the central N-assimilating enzymes together with their highly complex interactions. The engineering and modelling of such a complex network seem impossible because functioning depends critically on a gamut of data known at patchy accuracy. We developed a way out of this predicament, which employs: (i) a constrained optimization-based technology for the simultaneous fitting of models to heterogeneous experimental data sets gathered through diverse experimental set-ups, (ii) a \u2018rubber band method\u2019 to deal with different degrees of uncertainty, both in experimentally determined or estimated parameter values and in measured transient or steady-state variables (training data sets), (iii) integration of human expertise to decide on accuracies of both parameters and variables, (iv) massive computation employing a fast algorithm and a supercomputer, (v) an objective way of quantifying the plausibility of models, which makes it possible to decide which model is the best and how much better that model is than the others. We applied the new technology to the ammonium transport and assimilation network, integrating recent and older data of various accuracies, from different expert laboratories. The kinetic model objectively ranked best, has E. coli's AmtB as an active transporter of ammonia to be assimilated with GlnK minimizing the futile cycling that is an inevitable consequence of intracellular ammonium accumulation. It is 130 times better than a model with facilitated passive transport of ammonia."

Here, we describe a ligand exchange strategy involving the displacement of both cationic and anionic ligands on native model systems of CsPbBr                             3                              NCs, which are exclusively coated with Cs-oleate.

The results, together with density functional theory calculations, suggest that the higher stability of quaternary ammonium capped NCs is not due to a stronger binding interaction to the surface but rather to weaker solvent-ligand interactions of R                             4                             NBr compared to Cs-oleate, driving the former to the surface of the NCs.

Although many studies have examined the autoantibody response to intrinsic factor and H+,K+-ATPase, no information is available on possible pathogenic mechanisms mediated by intrinsic factor - specific gastric T cells. Aim of this study was to investigate intrinsic factor-specific T cells in the gastric mucosa of pernicious anemia patients and define their functional properties. For the first time we provide evidence that gastric mucosa of pernicious anemia patients harbour a high proportion (20%) of autoreactive activated CD4+ T-cell clones that specifically recognize intrinsic factor. Most of these clones (94%) showed a T helper 17 or T helper 1 profile. All intrinsic factor-specific clones produced tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin-21 and provided substantial help for B-cell immunoglobulin production. Most mucosa-derived intrinsic factor-specific T-cell clones expressed cytotoxicity against target cells. Our results indicate that activation of intrinsic factor-specific T helper 17 and T helper 1 T cells in the gastric mucosa represent a key effector mechanism in pernicious anemia suggesting that the T helper 17/T helper 1 pathway may represent a novel target for the prevention and treatment of the disease."

  "description": "Symmetry dependence and universality of practical algebraic functionals in density-matrix-functional theoryWhen dealing with a fully symmetrical ground state, the symmetry dependence of the universal Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional F[\u03b3] of the first-order reduced density matrix (RDM) \u03b3 can be conveniently neglected. The situation changes drastically in the case of the dissociation of a symmetrical molecule with the state crossing, in the course of which the potential energy curve of the initial non-fully symmetrical ground state is eventually crossed with that of the fully symmetrical state. In this case, as is demonstrated in the present paper, the second-order RDM \u0393ij,kl in the representation of the natural orbitals (NOs) is symmetry dependent. Since \u0393ij,kl is the goal in the design of \u0393ij,kl(n) as a functional of NO occupations {n}, which is part of a practical density matrix functional F[\u03b3],\u0393ij,kl(n) must also depend on the symmetry, especially the irreducible representation of the symmetry group. The result has immediate implications for study of structural (or phase) transitions based on a single symmetry-independent functional. The demonstration is given in the minimal-base model of the dissociation of the prototype H4 molecule in the rhombic structure."

Site-directed mutagenesis data provides an invaluable complementary source of information for elucidating the structural determinants of binding of different ligand chemotypes. The current study provides a comparative analysis of 6692 mutation data points on 34 aminergic GPCR subtypes, covering the chemical space of 540 unique ligands from mutagenesis experiments and information from experimentally determined structures of 52 distinct aminergic receptor-ligand complexes. The integrated analysis enables detailed investigation of structural receptor-ligand interactions and assessment of the transferability of combined binding mode and mutation data across ligand chemotypes and receptor subtypes. An overview is provided of the possibilities and limitations of using mutation data to guide the design of novel aminergic receptor ligands."

It covers different sample preparation methods such as solid-liquid and liquid-liquid extraction. The main technique used for this analysis was gas chromatography (GC) with various detectors such as electron capture, flame photometric, nitrogen phosphorus, and mass spectrometric detection. Liquid chromatography (LC) with mass spectrometric detection was sometimes used to determine the levels of very polar insecticide residues. From the articles reviewed 74% of the insecticides detected were organochlorines with DDTs, lindanes, and endosulfans as most abundant ones. Levels of the insecticides of interest analysed, varied from below the detection limits to clearly above the safety limits. The lowest detected concentration of insecticide residues reported in fruits and vegetables was \u03b4-lindane in pawpaw (0.06 mg/kg) while the highest was fenvalerate (25.6 mg/kg). Insecticide residues reported in sediment were predominantly organochlorines with concentrations ranging from 9.68 ng/kg to 10.98 \u00b5g/kg. Endosulfan and its metabolites were the main insecticides found in water bodies with concentrations ranging from 0.036 \u00b5g/L to 62.3 \u00b5g/L. DDT and its metabolites were the dominant insecticides found in human fluids."

Histone peptides bearing trimethylthialysine and trimethyllysine were examined for binding with five human reader proteins employing a combination of thermodynamic analyses, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical analyses. Collectively, our experimental and computational findings reveal that trimethylthialysine and trimethyllysine exhibit very similar binding characteristics for the association with human reader proteins, thereby justifying the use of trimethylthialysine for studies aimed at dissecting the origin of biomolecular recognition in epigenetic processes that play important roles in human health and disease."

OBJECTIVES: As phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have been claimed as novel targets against T. cruzi, our aim was to evaluate the biological aspects of 12 new phthalazinone PDE inhibitors against different T. cruzi strains and parasite forms relevant for human infection. METHODS: In vitro trypanocidal activity of the inhibitors was assessed alone and in combination with benznidazole. Their effects on parasite ultrastructural and cAMP levels were determined. PDE mRNA levels from the different T. cruzi forms were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: Five TcrPDEs were found to be expressed in all parasite stages. Four compounds displayed strong effects against intracellular amastigotes. Against bloodstream trypomastigotes (BTs), three were at least as potent as benznidazole. In vitro combination therapy with one of the most active inhibitors on both parasite forms (NPD-040) plus benznidazole demonstrated a quite synergistic profile (x\u03a3 FICI\u2009=\u20090.58) against intracellular amastigotes but no interaction (x\u03a3 FICI\u2009=\u20091.27) when BTs were assayed. BTs treated with NPD-040 presented disrupted Golgi apparatus, a swollen flagellar pocket and signs of autophagy. cAMP measurements of untreated parasites showed that amastigotes have higher ability to efflux this second messenger than BTs. NPD-001 and NPD-040 increase the intracellular cAMP content in both BTs and amastigotes, which is also released into the extracellular milieu. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the potential of PDE inhibitors as anti-T. cruzi drug candidates."

  "description": "Polarisable force fields: what do they add in biomolecular simulations?The quality of biomolecular simulations critically depends on the accuracy of the force field used to calculate the potential energy of the molecular configurations. Currently, most simulations employ non-polarisable force fields, which describe electrostatic interactions as the sum of Coulombic interactions between fixed atomic charges. Polarisation of these charge distributions is incorporated only in a mean-field manner. In the past decade, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing simple, efficient, and yet generally applicable polarisable force fields for biomolecular simulations. In this review, we summarise the latest developments in accounting for key biomolecular interactions with polarisable force fields and applications to address challenging biological questions. In the end, we provide an outlook for future development in polarisable force fields."

  "description": "Proteomimetics as protein-inspired scaffolds with defined tertiary folding patternsProteins have evolved as a variable platform that provides access to molecules with diverse shapes, sizes and functions. These features have inspired chemists for decades to seek artificial mimetics of proteins with improved or novel properties. Such work has focused primarily on small protein fragments, often isolated secondary structures; however, there has lately been a growing interest in the design of artificial molecules that mimic larger, more complex tertiary folds. In this Perspective, we define these agents as \u2018proteomimetics\u2019 and discuss the recent advances in the field. Proteomimetics can be divided into three categories: protein domains with side-chain functionality that alters the native linear-chain topology; protein domains in which the chemical composition of the polypeptide backbone has been partially altered; and protein-like folded architectures that are composed entirely of non-natural monomer units. We give an overview of these proteomimetic approaches and outline remaining challenges facing the field."

  "description": "A framework for exhaustive modelling of genetic interaction patterns using Petri netsMOTIVATION: Genetic interaction (GI) patterns are characterized by the phenotypes of interacting single and double mutated gene pairs. Uncovering the regulatory mechanisms of GIs would provide a better understanding of their role in biological processes, diseases, and drug response. Computational analyses can provide insights into the underpinning mechanisms of GIs.RESULTS: In this study, we present a framework for exhaustive modelling of GI patterns using Petri nets (PN). Four-node models were defined and generated on three levels with restrictions, to enable an exhaustive approach. Simulations suggest \u223c5 million models of GIs. Generalizing these we propose putative mechanisms for the GI patterns, inversion and suppression. We demonstrate that exhaustive PN modelling enables reasoning about mechanisms of GIs when only the phenotypes of gene pairs are known. The framework can be applied to other GI or genetic regulatory datasets.AVAILABILITY: The framework is available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/ExhMod.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

  "title": "Evaluating age and temporal trends of chlorinated paraffins in pooled serum collected from males in Australia between 2004 and 2015Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are high production volume chemicals of which some show resistance to environmental degradation, long-rang transport, bioaccumulation and toxicity potential. Information regarding their presence in humans is limited, including their human bioaccumulation potential. The present study aimed to evaluate CP levels in human serum from Australia in order to better understand their exposure and current pollution status as well as trends associated with age and time between 2004 and 2015. For this, we selected a male sub-group of the Australian population under 60 years old (n = 16 pools, total 1600 serum samples). While long-chain CP (C18-20) and most short-chain CP (C10-13, SCCPs) levels were below method detection limits (MDL), medium-chain CPs (C14-17, MCCPs) were found in most serum samples (detection frequency 94%) as well as CPs with a carbon chain length of nine (detection frequency 76%). The levels of \u03a3SCCPs and \u03a3MCCPs ranged from <MDL\u2212140 and <MDL-520 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively, with a median value of 97 ng/g lw for SCCPs and 190 ng/g lw for MCCPs. Analysis by age stratification did not identify any trends but an increase of a factor of 2 in MCCPs levels was observed over time (p < 0.05). Plotting the MCCP/SCCP ratio of all available data in humans over time showed also an increasing trend, including for China. The reported levels are relatively low considering the levels reported in environmental media from Australia such which raises the question to what extent CPs accumulate in humans. Future studies on this aspect are required.General information",

  "description": "High throughput screening and identification of coagulopathic snake venom proteins and peptides using nanofractionation and proteomics approachesSnakebite is a neglected tropical disease that results in a variety of systemic and local pathologies in envenomed victims and is responsible for around 138,000 deaths every year. Many snake venoms cause severe coagulopathy that makes victims vulnerable to suffering life-threating haemorrhage. The mechanisms of action of coagulopathic snake venom toxins are diverse and can result in both anticoagulant and procoagulant effects. However, because snake venoms consist of a mixture of numerous protein and peptide components, high throughput characterizations of specific target bioactives is challenging. In this study, we applied a combination of analytical and pharmacological methods to identify snake venom toxins from a wide diversity of snake species that perturb coagulation. To do so, we used a high-throughput screening approach consisting of a miniaturised plasma coagulation assay in combination with a venom nanofractionation approach. Twenty snake venoms were first separated using reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and a post-column split allowed a small fraction to be analyzed with mass spectrometry, while the larger fraction was collected and dispensed onto 384-well plates. After fraction collection, any solvent present in the wells was removed by means of freeze-drying, after which it was possible to perform a plasma coagulation assay in order to detect coagulopathic activity. Our results demonstrate that many snake venoms simultaneously contain both procoagulant and anticoagulant bioactives that contribute to coagulopathy. In-depth identification analysis from seven medically-important venoms, via mass spectrometry and nanoLC-MS/MS, revealed that phospholipase A2 toxins are frequently identified in anticoagulant venom fractions, while serine protease and metalloproteinase toxins are often associated with procoagulant bioactivities. The nanofractionation and proteomics approach applied herein seems likely to be a valuable tool for the rational development of next-generation snakebite treatments by facilitating the rapid identification and fractionation of coagulopathic toxins, thereby enabling specific targeting of these toxins by new therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors."

  "description": "How Alkali Cations Catalyze Aromatic Diels-Alder ReactionsWe have quantum chemically studied alkali cation-catalyzed aromatic Diels-Alder reactions between benzene and acetylene forming barrelene using relativistic, dispersion-corrected density functional theory. The alkali cation-catalyzed aromatic Diels-Alder reactions are accelerated by up to 5 orders of magnitude relative to the uncatalyzed reaction and the reaction barrier increases along the series Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Rb+ < Cs+ < none. Our detailed activation strain and molecular-orbital bonding analyses reveal that the alkali cations lower the aromatic Diels-Alder reaction barrier by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled orbitals of the dienophile and the aromatic diene. We argue that such Pauli mechanism behind Lewis-acid catalysis is a more general phenomenon. Also, our results may be of direct importance for a more complete understanding of the network of competing mechanisms towards the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in an astrochemical context."

  "description": "Linking leaders' voluntary workplace green behavior and team green innovation: The mediation role of team green efficacyGiven the increasing significance of green innovation, scholars have identified environment-oriented leader behavior as a key antecedent of green innovation in firms. However, despite the fact that previous studies highlight all kinds of benefits of environment-oriented leaders' voluntary workplace green behavior (VWGB) in and for firms, little is known about how these leaders' VWGB could affect a firm team's green product innovation as well as their process innovation. To narrow this research gap, this study theorizes and tests the effect of leaders' VWGB on their team's green innovation, as well as the mediation effect of team green efficacy belief on this relationship. Using a time-lagged research design, we collected data from 497 employees and 80 leaders in Chinese manufacturing firms. The results show that leaders' VWGB directly affects both their team's green product and process innovation, and facilitates the development of team green efficacy, which in turn stimulates team green innovation. This present study extends the multilevel phenomena by reinforcing the importance of leaders' VWGB and team green efficacy on team-level green innovation, and provides practical implications on developing leadership for environmentally sustainable innovation."

  "description": "Why are consumers willing to pay more for liquid foods in environmentally friendly packaging? A dual attitudes perspectiveConsidering that one of the key components of liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging is its higher price, it may not be appealing to all consumers. However, a growing body of evidence has shown that the sale of liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging is increasing. The purpose of this study was to analyze why consumers are willing to pay more for liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging. Drawing on the theory of dual attitudes by Wilson, Lindsey, and Schooler, this study proposes that consumer purchasing behavior can be explained through implicit and explicit attitudes. Moreover, a consumer's ecoliteracy and ecofriendly lifestyle might be important predictors of consumer attitudes toward environmentally friendly packaging. Our conceptual model was tested on survey data from 11 countries, with a total of 7028 respondents. The study revealed that consumers' willingness to pay a higher price for liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging could be predicted by their positive attitudes toward (a) the environmental friendliness of the packaging, (b) the brand of the liquid food, and (c) the affordability of the liquid food in the environmentally friendly packaging. Ecoliteracy and having an ecofriendly lifestyle were found to be important predictors of consumer attitudes toward environmentally friendly packaging. This study contributes to the literature that aims to explain consumers' willingness to pay more for food in environmentally friendly packaging. It identifies how much more consumers are willing to pay for food in environmentally friendly packaging and why."

  "description": "Clb3-centered regulations are recurrent across distinct parameter regions in minimal autonomous cell cycle oscillator designsSome biological networks exhibit oscillations in their components to convert stimuli to time-dependent responses. The eukaryotic cell cycle is such a case, being governed by waves of cyclin-dependent kinase (cyclin/Cdk) activities that rise and fall with specific timing and guarantee its timely occurrence. Disruption of cyclin/Cdk oscillations could result in dysfunction through reduced cell division. Therefore, it is of interest to capture properties of network designs that exhibit robust oscillations. Here we show that a minimal yeast cell cycle network is able to oscillate autonomously, and that cyclin/Cdk-mediated positive feedback loops (PFLs) and Clb3-centered regulations sustain cyclin/Cdk oscillations, in known and hypothetical network designs. We propose that Clb3-mediated coordination of cyclin/Cdk waves reconciles checkpoint and oscillatory cell cycle models. Considering the evolutionary conservation of the cyclin/Cdk network across eukaryotes, we hypothesize that functional (\"healthy\") phenotypes require the capacity to oscillate autonomously whereas dysfunctional (potentially \"diseased\") phenotypes may lack this capacity."

Emerging from our activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital bonding analysis was an unprecedented finding, namely that the LAs accelerate the Diels\u2013Alder reaction by a diminished Pauli repulsion between the \u03c0-electron systems of the diene and dienophile.

Compound 1 resulted in being a potent TbrPDEB1 inhibitor with interesting activity against T. brucei in a phenotypic screen. Derivative 1 was studied in an acute in vivo mouse disease model but unfortunately showed no efficacy due to low metabolic stability.

In this framework, the optical properties of closed-shell Ag, Au and bimetallic Ag-Au nanoparticles with tetrahedral symmetry (with 20, 56, 120, and 165 atoms) and icosahedral structure (with 13, 55, and 147 atoms) were obtained and compared to full linear response time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) as a reference and also to time-dependent density functional based tight binding (TD-DFTB) as a low-cost alternative approach. We find an excellent agreement of TD-DFT+TB calculated absorption spectra with the TD-DFT reference with errors less than 0.15 eV in peak positions, while TD-DFTB shows larger errors of about 1 eV. The computational cost for the ground state calculation is identical for TD-DFT and TD-DFT+TB, but the excited state calculation becomes about a hundred times faster when applying the TB approximation and is then almost negligible for the overall timing of the calculation. In contrast to TD-DFTB, which can only be applied to element combinations for which a suitable DFTB parametrization is available, TD-DFT+TB can be applied to any combination of elements. To assess the accuracy of TD-DFT+TB for different combinations of atoms, the plasmonic properties of bimetallic clusters with different ratios of Ag and Au atoms were obtained and the trend of energy and intensity reproduced in good agreement with TD-DFT, which is not possible using TD-DFTB with standard parameter sets."

  "description": "Differential Role of Serines and Threonines in Intracellular Loop 3 and C-Terminal Tail of the Histamine H4 Receptor in \u03b2-Arrestin and G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase Interaction, Internalization, and SignalingThe histamine H4 receptor (H4R) activates G\u03b1i-mediated signaling and recruits \u03b2-arrestin2 upon stimulation with histamine. \u03b2-Arrestins play a regulatory role in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by interacting with phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in the GPCR C-terminal tail and intracellular loop 3, resulting in receptor desensitization and internalization. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensors, we show that G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) 2 and 3 are more quickly recruited to the H4R than \u03b2-arrestin1 and 2 upon agonist stimulation, whereas receptor internalization dynamics toward early endosomes was slower. Alanine-substitution revealed that a serine cluster at the distal end of the H4R C-terminal tail is essential for the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin1/2, and consequently, receptor internalization and desensitization of G protein-driven extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation and label-free cellular impedance. In contrast, alanine substitution of serines and threonines in the intracellular loop 3 of the H4R did not affect \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment and receptor desensitization, but reduced \u03b2-arrestin1 recruitment and internalization. Hence, \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to H4R requires the putative phosphorylated serine cluster in the H4R C-terminal tail, whereas putative phosphosites in the intracellular loop 3 have different effects on \u03b2-arrestin1 versus \u03b2-arrestin2. Mutation of these putative phosphosites in either intracellular loop 3 or the C-terminal tail did not affect the histamine-induced recruitment of GRK2 and GRK3 but does change the interaction of H4R with GRK5 and GRK6, respectively. Identification of H4R interactions with these proteins is a first step in the understanding how this receptor might be dysregulated in pathophysiological conditions."

Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593-1604 (2019)]. Here, we study the differences between effective potentials from fully numerical density functional and optimized effective potential calculations for fixed configurations. We find that the differences are small, overall, and choose exchange-only potentials at the local density approximation level of theory computed on top of Hartree-Fock densities as a good compromise. The differences between potentials arising from different atomic configurations are also found to be small at this level of theory. Furthermore, we discuss the efficient Gaussian-basis implementation of SAP via error function fits to fully numerical atomic radial potentials. The guess obtained from the fitted potentials can be easily implemented in any Gaussian-basis quantum chemistry code in terms of two-electron integrals. Fits covering the whole periodic table from H to Og are reported for non-relativistic as well as fully relativistic four-component calculations that have been carried out with fully numerical approaches."

Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on a study in an R&D department of a multinational high-tech firm in the Netherlands. The study consists of a case study design, focusing on four embedded cases, longitudinally studying each case. Findings: The literature distinguishes three dimensions of innovation decision-making processes: rational, intuitive and political. By studying these interwoven dimensions over time, this study finds that the dominant use of each of these dimensions differs across the innovation process. There is an emphasis on intuitive decision-making in an early phase, followed by more emphasis on political decision-making, and moving to more emphasis on rational decision-making in a later phase of the R&D process. Furthermore, the predominant choice in a specific innovation phase for one of the three decision-making dimensions is influenced by the decision-making dimension that is dominantly employed in the preceding phase. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes to the innovation decision-making literature by developing and applying a model that distinguishes rational, intuitive and political decision-making dimensions, the interactions among these dimensions in innovation decision-making in R&D, and the contingency of these dimensions upon the innovation phase. It calls for further research into the contingent nature of innovation decision-making processes. Practical implications: For practitioners this study has two relevant insights. First it highlights the importance and usefulness of intuitive and political decision-making in addition to the prevailing emphasis on rational decision-making. Second, practitioners may be more alert to consciously changing their dominant decision-making approach across the phases of the innovation process. Third, companies may adjust their human resource policies to this study\u2019s findings. Originality/value: The literature on rational, intuitive and political decision-making is quite extensive. However, research has hardly studied how these decision-making dimensions develop in conjunction, and over time. This paper reports on a first study to do so and finds that the dominant use of these dimensions is contingent upon the phase of the R&D process and on the decision-making dimensions used in earlier phases. The study suggests that using a contingency approach can help to further integrate the debate in research and practice.General information",

  "description": "Removing critical gaps in chemical test methods by developing new assays for the identification of thyroid hormone system-disrupting chemicals\u2014the ATHENA projectThe test methods that currently exist for the identification of thyroid hormone system-disrupting chemicals are woefully inadequate. There are currently no internationally validated in vitro assays, and test methods that can capture the consequences of diminished or enhanced thyroid hormone action on the developing brain are missing entirely. These gaps put the public at risk and risk assessors in a difficult position. Decisions about the status of chemicals as thyroid hormone system disruptors currently are based on inadequate toxicity data. The ATHENA project (Assays for the identification of Thyroid Hormone axis-disrupting chemicals: Elaborating Novel Assessment strategies) has been conceived to address these gaps. The project will develop new test methods for the disruption of thyroid hormone transport across biological barriers such as the blood\u2013brain and blood\u2013placenta barriers. It will also devise methods for the disruption of the downstream effects on the brain. ATHENA will deliver a testing strategy based on those elements of the thyroid hormone system that, when disrupted, could have the greatest impact on diminished or enhanced thyroid hormone action and therefore should be targeted through effective testing. To further enhance the impact of the ATHENA test method developments, the project will develop concepts for better international collaboration and development in the area of thyroid hormone system disruptor identification and regulation."

We investigated the influence on annotated lipids and different separation mechanisms (HILIC, C18, and PFP), and their different orders arranged in the first and the second dimensions. As a result, the number of lipid species annotated by conventional one-dimensional LC-MS was between 212 and 448. In contrast, the number of individual lipids species annotated by C18\u00d7HILIC, HILIC\u00d7C18, and HILIC\u00d7PFP were 1784, 1059, and 1123, respectively. Therefore, it was evident that the performance of comprehensive 2DLC, especially the C18\u00d7HILIC method, considerably exceeded 1DLC. Interestingly, a comparison of the HILIC\u00d7C18 and C18\u00d7HILIC approaches showed, under the optimized conditions, similar orthogonality, but the effective separation power of the C18\u00d7HILIC was much higher. A comparison of the HILIC\u00d7C18 and the HILIC\u00d7PFP methods demonstrated that the HILIC\u00d7PFP separation had superior orthogonality with a small increase on its effective peak capacity, indicating that the HILIC\u00d7PFP combination maybe a promising platform for untargeted lipidomics in complex samples. Finally, from the comprehensive lipid profiling respective, the C18\u00d7HILIC was selected for further studies."

  "description": "Development of a generic high-throughput screening assay for profiling snake venom protease activity after high-resolution chromatographic fractionationSnakebites cause upwards of 1.8 million envenomings, 138,000 deaths and 500,000 cases of long term morbidity each year. Viper snake venoms (family Viperidae) generally contain a high proportion of proteases which can cause devastating effects such as hemorrhage, coagulopathy, edema, necrosis, and severe pain, in envenomed victims. In this study, analytical techniques were combined with enzymatic assays to develop a novel method for the detection of snake venom protease activity by using rhodamine-110-peptide substrate. In the so called at-line nanofractionation set up, crude venoms were first separated with reversed phase liquid chromatography, after which fractions were collected onto 384-well plates. Protease activity assays were then performed in the 384-well plates and bioassay chromatograms were constructed revealing protease activity. Parallel obtained UV absorbance, MS and proteomics data from a previous study facilitated toxin identification. The application of the rhodamine-110-peptide substrate assay showed significantly greater sensitivity compared to prior assays using casein-FITC as the substrate. Moreover, cross referencing UV and MS data and resulted in the detection of a number of tentative proteases suspected to exhibit protease activity, including snake venom serine proteases from Calloselasma rhodostoma and Daboia russelli venom and a snake venom metalloproteinase from the venom of Echis ocellatus. Our data demonstrate that his methodology can be a useful tool for selectively identifying snake venom proteases, and can be applied to provide a better understanding of protease-induced pathologies and the development of novel therapeutics for treating snakebite."

Our purpose is twofold: (i) to compute accurate trends in chalcogen-bond strength based on a set of consistent data; and (ii) to rationalize these trends in terms of detailed analyses of the bonding mechanism based on quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) theory in combination with a canonical energy decomposition analysis (EDA). At odds with the commonly accepted view of chalcogen bonding as a predominantly electrostatic phenomenon, we find that chalcogen bonds, just as hydrogen and halogen bonds, have a significant covalent character stemming from strong HOMO\u2212LUMO interactions. Besides providing significantly to the bond strength, these orbital interactions are also manifested by the structural distortions they induce as well as the associated charge transfer from A\u2212 to D2Ch."

  "description": "A state-averaged orbital-optimized hybrid quantum\u2013classical algorithm for a democratic description of ground and excited statesIn the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, solving the electronic structure problem from chemistry is considered as the \u2018killer application\u2019 for near-term quantum devices. In spite of the success of variational hybrid quantum/classical algorithms in providing accurate energy profiles for small molecules, careful considerations are still required for the description of complicated features of potential energy surfaces. Because the current quantum resources are very limited, it is common to focus on a restricted part of the Hilbert space (determined by the set of active orbitals). While physically motivated, this approximation can severely impact the description of these complicated features. A perfect example is that of conical intersections (i.e. a singular point of degeneracy between electronic states), which are of primary importance to understand many prominent reactions. Designing active spaces so that the improved accuracy from a quantum computer is not rendered useless is key to finding useful applications of these promising devices within the field of chemistry. To answer this issue, we introduce a NISQ-friendly method called \u2018state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver\u2019 which combines two algorithms: (1) a state-averaged orbital-optimizer, and (2) a state-averaged VQE. To demonstrate the success of the method, we classically simulate it on a minimal Schiff base model (namely the formaldimine molecule CH2NH) relevant also for the photoisomerization in rhodopsin\u2014a crucial step in the process of vision mediated by the presence of a conical intersection. We show that merging both algorithms fulfil the necessary condition to describe the molecule\u2019s conical intersection, i.e. the ability to treat degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) states on the same footing."

  "description": "Business model innovation for sustainability: The role of stakeholder interaction and managerial cognitive changeBusiness model innovations emerge over time and are influenced by managerial interaction with stakeholders. Especially with regard to business model innovation for sustainability, manager\u2013stakeholder interaction can radically change a company\u2019s business model and underlying logic. However, the majority of the literature shows how manager\u2013stakeholder interaction may limit business model innovation when stakeholders reinforce existing managerial cognitions. In this chapter we study how stakeholders can also stimulate business model innovation by affecting managerial cognitive change. Through three case studies, we find that this can occur through three shaping processes: market approach shaping, product/service offering shaping, and credibility shaping. We also find that the impact of new or latent stakeholders is greater than that of existing stakeholders. We end the chapter by sketching a research agenda to further unravel the role of stakeholders affecting managerial cognition around business model innovation for sustainability."

  "description": "Designing Rh(I)-Half-Sandwich Catalysts for Alkyne [2+2+2] CycloadditionsMetal-mediated [2+2+2] cycloadditions of unsaturated molecules to cyclic and polycyclic organic compounds are a versatile synthetic route affording good yields and selectivity under mild conditions. In the last two decades, in silico investigations have unveiled important details about the mechanism and the energetics of the whole catalytic cycle. Particularly, a number of computational studies address the topic of half-sandwich catalysts which, due to their structural fluxionality, have been widely employed, since the 1980s. In these organometallic species, the metal is coordinated to an aromatic ring, typically the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl anion, C 5H 5-(Cp) or to the Cp moiety of a larger polycyclic aromatic ligand (Cp\u2032). During the catalytic process, the metal continuously 'slips' on the ring, changing its hapticity. This phenomenon of metal slippage and its implications for the catalyst's performance are discussed in this work, referring to the most important computational mechanistic studies reported in literature for Rh(I) half-metallocenes, with the purpose of providing hints for a rational design of this class of compounds. 1 Introduction 2 Mechanism of Metal-Catalyzed Acetylene [2+2+2] Cycloaddition to Benzene and the Problem of the Indenyl Effect 2.1 Acetylene-Acetonitrile [2+2+2] Co-cycloaddition to 2-Methylpyridine: Evidence of the Indenyl Effect 2.2 Heteroaromatic Catalysts and the Evidence of a Reverse Indenyl Effect 2.3 Booth's Mechanistic Hypothesis and the Evidence of the Indenyl Effect 3 Structure-Reactivity Correlation: The Slippage-Span Model 4 Conclusions and Perspectives."

  "description": "Heterologous Expression of ethA and katG in Mycobacterium marinum Enables the Rapid Identification of New Prodrugs Active against Mycobacterium tuberculosisScreening strategies for antituberculosis compounds using Mycobacterium tuberculosis are time consuming and require biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities, which makes the development of high-throughput assays difficult and expensive. Mycobacterium marinum, a close genetic relative of M. tuberculosis, possesses several advantages as a suitable model for tuberculosis drug screening. However, despite the high genetic similarity, there are some obvious differences in susceptibility to some tuberculosis drugs between these two species, especially for the prodrugs ethionamide and isoniazid. In this study, we aimed to improve M. marinum as a model for antituberculosis drug identification by heterologous expression of two common drug activators, EthA and KatG. These two activators were overexpressed in M. marinum, and the strains were tested against ethionamide, isoniazid, and a library of established antimycobacterial compounds from TB Alliance to compare drug susceptibility. Both in vitro and in vivo using zebrafish larvae, these genetically modified M. marinum strains showed significantly higher susceptibility against ethionamide and isoniazid, which require activation by EthA and KatG. More importantly, a strain overexpressing both ethA and katG was potentially more susceptible to approximately 20% of the antituberculosis hit compounds from the TB Alliance library. Most of these compounds were activated by EthA in M. marinum. Four of these compounds were selected for further analysis, and three of them showed obvious EthA-dependent activity against M. tuberculosis. Overall, our developed M. marinum strains are valuable tools for high-throughput discovery of potential novel antituberculosis prodrugs."

  "description": "Proton Transfer and SN2 Reactions as Steps of Fast Selenol and Thiol Oxidation in Proteins: A Model Molecular Study Based on GPxThe so-called peroxidatic cysteines and selenocysteines in proteins reduce hydroperoxides through a dual attack to the peroxide bond in a two-step mechanism. First, a proton dislocation from the thiol/selenol to a close residue of the enzymatic pocket occurs. Then, a nucleophilic attack of the anionic cysteine/selenocysteine to one O atom takes place, while the proton is shuttled back to the second O atom, promoting the formation of a water molecule. In this computational study, we use a molecular model of GPx to demonstrate that the enzymatic environment significantly lowers the barrier of the latter SN2 step. Particularly, in our Se-based model the energy barriers for the two steps are 29.82 and 2.83 kcal mol\u22121, both higher than the corresponding barriers computed in the enzymatic cluster, i. e., 21.60 and null, respectively. Our results, obtained at SMD-B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(d,p), cc-pVTZ//B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G(d,p), cc-pVTZ level of theory, show that the mechanistic details can be well reproduced using an oversimplified model, but the energetics is definitively more favorable in the GPx active site. In addition, we pinpoint the role of the chalcogen in the peroxide reduction process, rooting the advantages of the presence of selenium in its acidic and nucleophilic properties."

  "description": "Structure Activity Relationship of N-Substituted Phenyldihydropyrazolones Against Trypanosoma cruzi AmastigotesCurrent drugs for Chagas disease have long treatment regimens with occurrence of adverse drug effects leading to poor treatment compliance. Novel and efficacious medications are therefore highly needed. We previously reported on the discovery of NPD-0227 (2-isopropyl-5-(4-methoxy-3-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one) as a potent in vitro inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi (pIC50 = 6.4) with 100-fold selectivity over human MRC-5 cells. The present work describes a SAR study on the exploration of substituents on the phenylpyrazolone nitrogen. Modifications were either done directly onto this pyrazolone nitrogen or alternatively by introducing a piperidine linker. Attention was pointed toward the selection of substituents with a cLogP preferably below NPD-0227s cLogP of 3.5. Generally the more apolar compounds showed better activities then molecules with cLogPs <2.0. Several new compounds were identified with potencies that are in the same range as NPD-0227 (pIC50 = 6.4) and promising selectivities. While the potency could not be improved, valuable SAR was obtained. Furthermore the introduction of a piperidine linker offers new opportunities for derivatization as valuable novel starting points for future T. cruzi drug discovery."

  "description": "Analysis of missense variants in the human histamine receptor family reveals increased constitutive activity of e4106.30\u00d730k variant in the histamine h1 receptorThe Exome Aggregation Consortium has collected the protein-encoding DNA sequences of almost 61,000 unrelated humans. Analysis of this dataset for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) proteins (available at GPCRdb) revealed a total of 463 naturally occurring genetic missense variations in the histamine receptor family. In this research, we have analyzed the distribution of these missense variations in the four histamine receptor subtypes concerning structural segments and sites important for GPCR function. Four missense variants R1273.52\u00d752H, R13934.57\u00d757H, R4096.29\u00d729H, and E4106.30\u00d730 K, were selected for the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) that were hypothesized to affect receptor activity by interfering with the interaction pattern of the highly conserved D(E)RY motif, the so-called ionic lock. The E4106.30\u00d730 K missense variant displays higher constitutive activity in G protein signaling as compared to wild-type H1R, whereas the opposite was observed for R1273.52\u00d752H, R13934.57\u00d757H, and R4096.29\u00d729H. The E4106.30\u00d730 K missense variant displays a higher affinity for the endogenous agonist histamine than wild-type H1R, whereas antagonist affinity was not affected. These data support the hypothesis that the E4106.30\u00d730 K mutation shifts the equilibrium towards active conformations. The study of these selected missense variants gives additional insight into the structural basis of H1R activation and, moreover, highlights that missense variants can result in pharmacologically different behavior as compared to wild-type receptors and should consequently be considered in the drug discovery process."

  "description": "Proteome constraints reveal targets for improving microbial fitness in nutrient-rich environmentsCells adapt to different conditions via gene expression that tunes metabolism for maximal fitness. Constraints on cellular proteome may limit such expression strategies and introduce trade-offs. Resource allocation under proteome constraints has explained regulatory strategies in bacteria. It is unclear, however, to what extent these constraints can predict evolutionary changes, especially for microorganisms that evolved under nutrient-rich conditions, i.e., multiple available nitrogen sources, such as Lactococcus lactis. Here, we present a proteome-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of L.lactis (pcLactis) to interpret growth on multiple nutrients. Through integration of proteomics and flux data, in glucose-limited chemostats, the model predicted glucose and arginine uptake as dominant constraints at low growth rates. Indeed, glucose and arginine catabolism were found upregulated in evolved mutants. At high growth rates, pcLactis correctly predicted the observed shutdown of arginine catabolism because limited proteome availability favored lactate for ATP production. Thus, our model-based analysis is able to identify and explain the proteome constraints that limit growth rate in nutrient-rich environments and thus form targets of fitness improvement."

  "description": "Viral G Protein-Coupled Receptors: Attractive Targets for Herpesvirus-Associated DiseasesHerpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that establish lifelong, latent infections in their host. Spontaneous reactivation of herpesviruses is often asymptomatic or clinically manageable in healthy individuals, but reactivation events in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. Moreover, herpesvirus infections have been associated with multiple proliferative cardiovascular and post-transplant diseases. Herpesviruses encode viral G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs) that alter the host cell by hijacking cellular pathways and play important roles in the viral life cycle and these different disease settings. In this review, we discuss the pharmacological and signaling properties of these vGPCRs, their role in the viral life cycle, and their contribution in different diseases. Because of their prominent role, vGPCRs have emerged as promising drug targets, and the potential of vGPCR-targeting therapeutics is being explored. Overall, these vGPCRs can be considered as attractive targets moving forward in the development of antiviral, cancer, and/or cardiovascular disease treatments. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In the last decade, herpesvirus-encoded G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have emerged as interesting drug targets with the growing understanding of their critical role in the viral life cycle and in different disease settings. This review presents the pharmacological properties of these viral receptors, their role in the viral life cycle and different diseases, and the emergence of therapeutics targeting viral GPCRs."

Our Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) analyses reveal that hyperconjugative orbital interactions favor the gauche conformation in all cases (X = F\u2212I), not only for X = F as in the current model of this so-called gauche effect. We show that, instead, it is the interplay of hyperconjugation with Pauli repulsion between lone-pair-type orbitals on the halogen substituents that constitutes the causal mechanism for the gauche effect. Thus, only in the case of the relatively small fluorine atoms, steric Pauli repulsion is too weak to overrule the gauche preference of the hyperconjugative orbital interactions. For the larger halogens, X\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5X steric Pauli repulsion becomes sufficiently destabilizing to shift the energetic preference from gauche to anti, despite the opposite preference of hyperconjugation."

  "description": "Short\u2010 and long\u2010term social recognition memory are differentially modulated by neuronal histamineThe ability of recognizing familiar conspecifics is essential for many forms of social interaction including reproduction, establishment of dominance hierarchies, and pair bond formation in monogamous species. Many hormones and neurotransmitters have been suggested to play key roles in social discrimination. Here we demonstrate that disruption or potentiation of histaminergic neu-rotransmission differentially affects short (STM) and long\u2010term (LTM) social recognition memory. Impairments of LTM, but not STM, were observed in histamine\u2010deprived animals, either chronically (Hdc\u2212/\u2212 mice lacking the histamine\u2010synthesizing enzyme histidine decarboxylase) or acutely (mice treated with the HDC irreversible inhibitor \u03b1\u2010fluoromethylhistidine). On the contrary, restriction of histamine release induced by stimulation of the H3R agonist (VUF16839) impaired both STM and LTM. H3R agonism\u2010induced amnesic effect was prevented by pre\u2010treatment with donepezil, an ac-etylcholinesterase inhibitor. The blockade of the H3R with ciproxifan, which in turn augmented histamine release, resulted in a procognitive effect. In keeping with this hypothesis, the procognitive effect of ciproxifan was absent in both Hdc\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b1FMH\u2010treated mice. Our results suggest that brain histamine is essential for the consolidation of LTM but not STM in the social recognition test. STM impairments observed after H3R stimulation are probably related to their function as heterorecep-tors on cholinergic neurons."

  "description": "Dispersion without Many-Body Density Distortion: Assessment on Atoms and Small MoleculesThe \"fixed diagonal matrices\"(FDM) dispersion formalism [ Kooi, D. P.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2019, 10, 1537 ] is based on a supramolecular wave function constrained to leave the diagonal of the many-body density matrix of each monomer unchanged, reducing dispersion to a balance between kinetic energy and monomer-monomer interaction. The corresponding variational optimization leads to expressions for the dispersion energy in terms of the ground-state pair densities of the isolated monomers only, providing a framework to build new approximations without the need for polarizabilities or virtual orbitals. Despite the underlying microscopic real space mechanism being incorrect, as in the exact case there is density relaxation, the formalism has been shown to give extremely accurate (or even exact) dispersion coefficients for H and He. The question we answer in this work is how accurate the FDM expressions can be for isotropic and anisotropic C6 dispersion coefficients when monomer pair densities are used from different levels of theory, namely Hartree-Fock, MP2, and CCSD. For closed-shell systems, FDM with CCSD monomer pair densities yield a mean average percent error for isotropic C6 dispersion coefficients of about 7% and a maximum absolute error within 18%, with a similar accuracy for anisotropies. The performance for open-shell systems is less satisfactory, with CCSD pair densities performing sometimes worse than Hartree-Fock or MP2. In the present implementation, the computational cost on top of the monomer's ground-state calculations is O(N4). The results show little sensitivity to the basis set used in the monomer's calculations."

This modelling approach was applied to the South African Angora goat, that suffers from hypocortisolism caused by altered adrenal function. These animals are extremely vulnerable to cold stress, leading to substantial monetary loss in the mohair industry. The Angora goat has increased CYP17A1 17,20-lyase enzyme activity in comparison with hardy livestock species. Determining the effect of this altered adrenal function on adrenal steroidogenesis during a cold stress response is difficult. We developed a model describing adrenal steroidogenesis under control conditions, and under altered steroidogenic conditions where the animal suffers from hypocortisolism. The model is parameterised with experimental data from in vitro enzyme characterisations of a hardy control species. The increased 17,20-lyase activity of the Angora goat CYP17A1 enzyme was subsequently incorporated into the model and the response to physiological stress is simulated under both control and altered adrenal steroidogenic conditions."

  "description": "The Pauli Repulsion-Lowering Concept in CatalysisConspectusOrganic chemistry has undoubtedly had a profound impact on humanity. Day in and day out, we find ourselves constantly surrounded by organic compounds. Pharmaceuticals, plastics, fuels, cosmetics, detergents, and agrochemicals, to name a few, are all synthesized by organic reactions. Very often, these reactions require a catalyst in order to proceed in a timely and selective manner. Lewis acids and organocatalysts are commonly employed to catalyze organic reactions and are considered to enhance the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) interactions. A vast number of textbooks and primary literature sources suggest that the binding of a Lewis acid or an iminium catalyst to a reactant (R1) stabilizes its LUMO and leads to a smaller HOMO(R2)-LUMO(R1) energy gap with the other reactant (R2), thus resulting in a faster reaction. This forms the basis for the so-called LUMO-lowering catalysis concept. Despite the simplicity and popularity of FMO theory, a number of deficiencies have emerged over the years, as a consequence of these FMOs not being the operative factor in the catalysis. LUMO-lowering catalysis is ultimately incomplete and is not always operative in catalyzed organic reactions. Our groups have recently undertaken a concerted effort to generate a unified framework to rationalize and predict chemical reactivity using a causal model that is rooted in quantum mechanics. In this Account, we propose the concept of Pauli repulsion-lowering catalysis to understand the catalysis in fundamental processes in organic chemistry. Our findings emerge from state-of-the-art computational methods, namely, the activation strain model (ASM) of reactivity in conjunction with quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital theory (KS-MO) and a matching energy decomposition analysis (EDA). The binding of the catalyst to the substrate not only leads to a stabilization of its LUMO but also induces a significant reduction of the two-orbital, four-electron Pauli repulsion involving the key molecular orbitals of both reactants. This repulsion-lowering originates, for the textbook Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction, from the catalyst polarizing the occupied \u03c0orbital of the dienophile away from the carbon atoms that form new bonds with the diene. This polarization of the occupied dienophile \u03c0orbital reduces the occupied orbital overlap with the diene and constitutes the ultimate physical factor responsible for the acceleration of the catalyzed process as compared to the analogous uncatalyzed reaction. We show that this physical mechanism is generally applicable regardless of the type of reaction (Diels-Alder and Michael addition reactions) and the way the catalyst is bonded to the reactants (i.e., from pure covalent or dative bonds to weaker hydrogen or halogen bonds). We envisage that the insights emerging from our analysis will guide future experimental developments toward the design of more efficient catalytic transformations. "

  "description": "Online biophysical predictions for SARS-CoV-2 proteinsBACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, consists of an assembly of proteins that determine its infectious and immunological behavior, as well as its response to therapeutics. Major structural biology efforts on these proteins have already provided essential insights into the mode of action of the virus, as well as avenues for structure-based drug design. However, not all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, or regions thereof, have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, and as such might exhibit ambiguous, dynamic behaviour that is not evident from static structure representations, nor from molecular dynamics simulations using these structures. MAIN: We present a website ( https://bio2byte.be/sars2/ ) that provides protein sequence-based predictions of the backbone and side-chain dynamics and conformational propensities of these proteins, as well as derived early folding, disorder, \u03b2-sheet aggregation, protein-protein interaction and epitope propensities. These predictions attempt to capture the inherent biophysical propensities encoded in the sequence, rather than context-dependent behaviour such as the final folded state. In addition, we provide the biophysical variation that is observed in homologous proteins, which gives an indication of the limits of their functionally relevant biophysical behaviour.CONCLUSION: The https://bio2byte.be/sars2/ website provides a range of protein sequence-based predictions for 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, enabling researchers to form hypotheses about their possible functional modes of action."

  "description": "How does the composition of a PAH influence its microsolvation? A rotational spectroscopy study of the phenanthrene-water and phenanthridine-water clustersWe report on the noncovalent intermolecular interactions established between the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phenanthrene and phenanthridine with water. Such noncovalent interactions involving extended aromatic systems and water molecules are ubiquitous in a variety of chemical and biological systems. Our study provides spectroscopic results on simple model systems to understand the impact that an extended aromatic surface and the presence of a heteroatom have on the nature of the noncovalent interactions established with the solvent. Microhydrated phenanthrene and phenanthridine clusters with up to three water molecules have been observed and unambiguously characterised by means of broadband rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the backbone of phenanthridine remarkably affects the geometries of the water clusters and the interaction networks at play, with O-H\u22efN and C-H\u22efO interactions becoming preferred in the phenanthridine-water clusters over the O-H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions seen in the phenanthrene-water clusters. The presence of this heteroatom induces nuclear quadrupole coupling, which was used to understand the cooperativity effects found with increasing cluster size. Our results provide important insight to draw a more complete picture of the noncovalent interactions involving solvent molecules and aromatic systems larger than benzene, and they can be significant to enhance our understanding of the aromatic-polar interactions at play in a myriad of chemical and biological contexts."

  "description": "A contamination assessment of the CI carbonaceous meteorite Orgueil using a DNA-directed approachThe Orgueil meteorite has become one of the most well-studied carbonaceous meteorites, after it fell in France 150 yr ago. Extraterrestrial organic compounds such as amino acids and nucleobases in the parts per billion ranges were identified in Orgueil samples with supporting isotopic analyses. However, speculations of terrestrial contamination such as organic inclusions in the form of microbes and seeds accompanied the analyses of the Orgueil meteorite ever since its fall. By using molecular analysis, we performed DNA extractions and spiking experiments combined with 16S and 18S rRNA gene targeted PCR amplification to quantify the level of terrestrial biocontamination. Our results indicate that terrestrial contamination with DNA was insignificant in the investigated meteorite fraction. We also remeasured and confirmed concentrations of amino acids found in previous studies and conclude that their rather high concentrations and distribution cannot be explained by terrestrial contamination with microorganisms alone. These results represent the first analysis using DNA-directed tools in the analysis of the Orgueil meteorite to determine trace levels of biomarkers."

  "description": "ConBind: Motif-aware cross-species alignment for the identification of functional transcription factor binding sitesEukaryotic gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) binding to promoter as well as distal enhancers. TFs recognize short, but specific binding sites (TFBSs) that are located within the promoter and enhancer regions. Functionally relevant TFBSs are often highly conserved during evolution leaving a strong phylogenetic signal. While multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a potent tool to detect the phylogenetic signal, the current MSA implementations are optimized to align the maximum number of identical nucleotides. This approach might result in the omission of conserved motifs that contain interchangeable nucleotides such as the ETS motif (IUPAC code: GGAW). Here, we introduce ConBind, a novel method to enhance alignment of short motifs, even if their mutual sequence similarity is only partial. ConBind improves the identification of conserved TFBSs by improving the alignment accuracy of TFBS families within orthologous DNA sequences. Functional validation of the Gfi1b + 13 enhancer reveals that ConBind identifies additional functionally important ETS binding sites that were missed by all other tested alignment tools. In addition to the analysis of known regulatory regions, our web tool is useful for the analysis of TFBSs on so far unknown DNA regions identified through ChIP-sequencing."

  "description": "CLUB-MARTINI: Selecting favourable interactions amongst available candidates, a coarse-grained simulation approach to scoring docking decoysLarge-scale identification of native binding orientations is crucial for understanding the role of protein-protein interactions in their biological context. Measuring binding free energy is the method of choice to estimate binding strength and reveal the relevance of particular conformations in which proteins interact. In a recent study, we successfully applied coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to measure binding free energy for two protein complexes with similar accuracy to full-atomistic simulation, but 500-fold less time consuming. Here, we investigate the efficacy of this approach as a scoring method to identify stable binding conformations from thousands of docking decoys produced by protein docking programs. To test our method, we first applied it to calculate binding free energies of all protein conformations in a CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) benchmark dataset, which included over 19000 protein docking solutions for 15 benchmark targets. Based on the binding free energies, we ranked all docking solutions to select the near-native binding modes under the assumption that the native-solutions have lowest binding free energies. In our top 100 ranked structures, for the 'easy' targets that have many near-native conformations, we obtain a strong enrichment of acceptable or better quality structures; for the 'hard' targets without near-native decoys, our method is still able to retain structures which have native binding contacts. Moreover, in our top 10 selections, CLUB-MARTINI shows a comparable performance when compared with other state-of-the-art docking scoring functions. As a proof of concept, CLUB-MARTINI performs remarkably well for many targets and is able to pinpoint near-native binding modes in the top selections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time interaction free energy calculated from MD simulations have been used to rank docking solutions at a large scale."

  "description": "One single, fast and robust capillary electrophoresis method for the direct quantification of intact adenovirus particles in upstream and downstream processing samplesDuring development of adenovirus-based vaccines, samples have to be analyzed in order to either monitor the production process or control the quality and safety of the product. An important quality attribute is the total concentration of intact adenoviruses, which currently is determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or anion exchange-HPLC. Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) was evaluated as alternative to the current methods with the aim to have one single method that allows reliable and fast quantification of adenovirus particles throughout the full process. Intact adenoviruses samples from downstream processing and upstream processing were analyzed directly by CE with UV-detection at 214nm. Only the samples with high amounts of DNA required a simple sample pretreatment by benzonase. Adenovirus particles were separated from matrix components such as cell debris, residual cell DNA, and/or proteins on a PVA-coated capillary using a BGE consisting of 125mM Tris, 338mM tricine and 0.2% v/v polysorbate-20 at pH 7.7. Full factorial design of experiments was used for method optimization as part of the analytical quality by design (AQbD) method development approach. The method was validated for the quantification of adenoviruses on five representative samples from the manufacturing process in the range of 0.5\u00d71011\u20131.5\u00d71011 adenovirus particles per ml (~80 to 250pmol/l). The CE method showed intermediate precision of 7.8% RSD on concentration and an accuracy (spiked recovery) of 95\u2013110%. CE proved highly useful for process development support and is being implemented for in-process control testing for adenovirus vaccine manufacturing."

  "description": "The effects of partial sleep deprivation on energy balance: A systematic review and meta-analysisBackground/Objectives:It is unknown whether short sleep duration causatively contributes to weight gain. Studies investigating effects of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) on energy balance components report conflicting findings. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of human intervention studies assessing the effects of PSD on energy intake (EI) and energy expenditure (EE).Subjects/Methods:EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science and Scopus were searched. Differences in EI and total EE following PSD compared with a control condition were generated using the inverse variance method with random-effects models. Secondary outcomes included macronutrient distribution and resting metabolic rate. Heterogeneity was quantified with the I 2 -statistic.Results:Seventeen studies (n=496) were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review, and 11 studies (n=172) provided sufficient data to be included in meta-analyses. EI was significantly increased by 385 kcal (95% confidence interval: 252, 517; P<0.00001) following PSD compared with the control condition. We found no significant change in total EE or resting metabolic rate as a result of PSD. The observed increase in EI was accompanied by significantly higher fat and lower protein intakes, but no effect on carbohydrate intake.Conclusions:The pooled effects of the studies with extractable data indicated that PSD resulted in increased EI with no effect on EE, leading to a net positive energy balance, which in the long term may contribute to weight gain."

  "description": "Diurnal Oscillations in Liver Mass and Cell Size Accompany Ribosome Assembly CyclesThe liver plays a pivotal role in metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification, processes that must be particularly efficient when animals are active and feed. A majorquestion is how the liver adapts to these diurnal changes in physiology. Here, we show that, in mice, liver mass, hepatocyte size, and protein levels follow a daily rhythm, whose amplitude depends on both feeding-fasting and light-dark cycles. Correlative evidence suggests that the daily oscillation in global protein accumulation depends on a similar fluctuation in ribosome number. Whereas rRNA genes are transcribed at similar rates throughout the day, some newly synthesized rRNAs are polyadenylated and degraded in the nucleus in a robustly diurnal fashion with a phase opposite to that of ribosomal protein synthesis. Based on studies with cultured fibroblasts, we propose that rRNAs not packaged into complete ribosomal subunits are polyadenylated by the poly(A) polymerase PAPD5 and degraded by the nuclear exosome."

Staining large zeolite crystals with MFI (ZSM-5) topology and subsequent mapping of the resulting fluorescence using confocal fluorescence microscopy reveal differences in structural integrity: the 90\u00b0 intergrowth sections of MFI crystals are prone to develop structural imperfections, which act as entrance routes for the probes into the zeolite crystal. Polarization-dependent measurements provide evidence for the probe molecule's alignment within the MFI zeolite pore system. The developed method was extended to BEA (Beta) crystals, showing that the previously observed hourglass pattern is a general feature of BEA crystals with this morphology. Furthermore, the probes can accurately identify at which crystal faces of BEA straight or sinusoidal pores open to the surface. The results show this method can spatially resolve the architecture-dependent internal pore structure of microporous materials, which is difficult to assess using other characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction."

  "description": "Catalytic Oxidation of Water with High-Spin Iron(IV)-Oxo Species: Role of the Water SolventWe use density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics to study the conversion of H2O into H2O2 in water solution by the FeIVO2+ group under room-temperature and -pressure conditions. We compute the free energy of formation of an O(water)-O(oxo) bond using thermodynamic integration with explicit solvent and we examine the subsequent generation of H2O2 by proton transfer. We show that the O-O bond formation follows the standard reactivity pattern observed in hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by high-spin (S = 2) iron(IV)-oxo species, which is initiated by the transfer of one electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital of the moiety attacking the FeIVO2+ group, either a -C-H bonding orbital (hydroxylation) or a lone pair of a water molecule (water oxidation). The highly electrophilic character exhibited by the FeIVO2+ ion, which is related to the presence of an acceptor 3\u03c3\u2217 orbital at low energy with a large contribution on the O end of the FeIVO2+ ion, is the crucial factor promoting the electron transfer. The electron transfer occurs at an O(water)-O(oxo) distance of ca. 1.6 \u00c5, and the free energy required to favorably orient a solvent H2O molecule for the O(oxo) attack and to bring it to the transition state amounts to only 35 kJ mol-1. The ensuing exoergonic O-O bond formation is accompanied by the progressive weakening of one of the O-H bonds of the attacking H2O assisted by a second solvent molecule and leads to the formation of an incipient Fe2+-[O-O-H]-[H3O+] group. Simultaneously, three additional solvent molecules correlate their motion and form a hydrogen-bonded string, which closes to form a loop within 5 ps. The migration of the H+ ion in this loop via a Grotthuss mechanism leads to the eventual protonation of the [O-O-H]- moiety, its progressive removal from the Fe2+ coordination sphere, and the formation of free H2O2 in solution."

BPA has been reported in thermal paper in concentrations up to 42,600 \u03bcg g\u22121. The exposure to BPA via dermal transfer has been recently discussed as a significant contribution to the overall human exposure and the estimated daily intake (EDI) has been reported up to 218 \u03bcg d\u22121. BPA has been also detected in recycled paper with concentrations up to 46 \u03bcg g\u22121. Due to the fact that BPA is a known endocrine disruptor and migrates from materials, regulatory restrictions have been established to prevent risks for the human health. As a consequence, structural analogues, such as bisphenol S (BPS) have been introduced into the market. Little is known about the presence and toxicity of these emerging replacements, and concern has risen about them. The present review gives an overview of the occurrence and levels of BPA and replacements in thermal paper. BPA is still the most common color developer found in thermal paper, followed by BPS. The analytical methods used for quantification of BPA and BPA replacements in paper products are also reviewed. BPA is transferred from thermal paper products to the finger pads upon handling it. Paper-skin transfer followed by penetration of BPA depends on conditions (e.g. greasiness of fingers and use of hand cream). It is, however, still debated whether thermal paper as a source for human exposure contributes significantly to the overall internal BPA exposure."

  "description": "Seeing the trees through the forest: sequence-based homo- and heteromeric protein-protein interaction sites prediction using random forestMotivation: Genome sequencing is producing an ever-increasing amount of associated protein sequences. Few of these sequences have experimentally validated annotations, however, and computational predictions are becoming increasingly successful in producing such annotations. One key challenge remains the prediction of the amino acids in a given protein sequence that are involved in protein-protein interactions. Such predictions are typically based on machine learning methods that take advantage of the properties and sequence positions of amino acids that are known to be involved in interaction. In this paper, we evaluate the importance of various features using Random Forest (RF), and include as a novel feature backbone flexibility predicted from sequences to further optimise protein interface prediction.Results: We observe that there is no single sequence feature that enables pinpointing interacting sites in our Random Forest models. However, combining different properties does increase the performance of interface prediction. Our homomeric-trained RF interface predictor is able to distinguish interface from non-interface residues with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 in a homomeric test-set. The heteromeric-trained RF interface predictor performs better than existing predictors on a independent heteromeric test-set. We trained a more general predictor on the combined homomeric and heteromeric dataset, and show that in addition to predicting homomeric interfaces, it is also able to pinpoint interface residues in heterodimers. This suggests that our random forest model and the features included capture common properties of both homodimer and heterodimer interfaces.Availability and Implementation: The predictors and test datasets used in our analyses are freely available ( http://www.ibi.vu.nl/downloads/RF_PPI/ ).Contact: k.a.feenstra@vu.nl.Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

The analysis conditions were designed to fit the requirements of both affinity LC and ESI-MS. The mobile phase composition was optimized to maintain the proteins studied in native conditions and enable sharp pH changes in order to mimic properly IgGs Fc domain/FcRn receptor interaction. Mobile phase components needed to be sufficiently volatile to achieve native MS analysis. MS data demonstrated the conservation of the pseudonative form of IgGs and allowed identification of the separated variants. Native FcRn affinity LC-ESI-MS was performed on a therapeutic mAb undergoing various oxidation stress. Native MS detection was used to determine the sample oxidation level. Lower retention was observed for mAbs oxidized variants compared to their intact counterparts indicating decreased affinities for the receptor. This methodology proved to be suitable to identify and quantify post-translational modifications at native protein level in order to correlate their influence on the binding to the FcRn receptor. Native FcRn affinity LC-ESI-MS can tremendously reduce the time required to assess the biological relevance of the IgG microheterogeneities thus providing valuable information for biopharmaceutical research and development."

  "description": "Developments and interlaboratory study of the analysis of short-chain chlorinated paraffinsTo survey the conformity and quality of the results between laboratories for short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) determination, we reviewed current and novel analytical methods and organized four worldwide laboratory exercises between 2011 and 2017. Participants were requested to analyse test solutions and extracts of various matrices with their method of choice. Thirty-three laboratories participated (9\u201322 per round), of which 55\u201381% were able to submit data. Large differences in results between laboratories were found (CVs 23\u2013137%) but results improved over time, while the levels in the test materials decreased. In the last round acceptable CV values (<25%) were obtained for the test solution. In the last round, results obtained by the GC\u2013ECNI-LRMS technique varied most, which is disconcerting as this technique is most commonly applied. We strongly suggest to continue monitoring comparability of laboratories to assess consensus in SCCP analysis, with a focus on quantification procedures applied."

  "description": "Understanding start-up problems in yeast glycolysisYeast glycolysis has been the focus of research for decades, yet a number of dynamical aspects of yeast glycolysis remain poorly understood at present. If nutrients are scarce, yeast will provide its catabolic and energetic needs with other pathways, but the enzymes catalysing upper glycolytic fluxes are still expressed. We conjecture that this overexpression facilitates the rapid transition to glycolysis in case of a sudden increase in nutrient concentration. However, if starved yeast is presented with abundant glucose, it can enter into an imbalanced state where glycolytic intermediates keep accumulating, leading to arrested growth and cell death. The bistability between regularly functioning and imbalanced phenotypes has been shown to depend on redox balance. We shed new light on these phenomena with a mathematical analysis of an ordinary differential equation model, including NADH to account for the redox balance. In order to gain qualitative insight, most of the analysis is parameter-free, i.e., without assigning a numerical value to any of the parameters. The model has a subtle bifurcation at the switch between an inviable equilibrium state and stable flux through glycolysis. This switch occurs if the ratio between the flux through upper glycolysis and ATP consumption rate of the cell exceeds a fixed threshold. If the enzymes of upper glycolysis would be barely expressed, our model predicts that there will be no glycolytic flux, even if external glucose would be at growth-permissable levels. The existence of the imbalanced state can be found for certain parameter conditions independent of the mentioned bifurcation. The parameter-free analysis proved too complex to directly gain insight into the imbalanced states, but the starting point of a branch of imbalanced states can be shown to exist in detail. Moreover, the analysis offers the key ingredients necessary for successful numerical continuation, which highlight the existence of this bistability and the influence of the redox balance."

  "description": "Chemical Diversity in the G Protein-Coupled Receptor SuperfamilyG protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell signaling transmembrane proteins that can be modulated by a plethora of chemical compounds. Systematic cheminformatics analysis of structurally and pharmacologically characterized GPCR ligands shows that cocrystallized GPCR ligands cover a significant part of chemical ligand space, despite their limited number. Many GPCR ligands and substructures interact with multiple receptors, providing a basis for polypharmacological ligand design. Experimentally determined GPCR structures represent a variety of binding sites and receptor\u2013ligand interactions that can be translated to chemically similar ligands for which structural data are lacking. This integration of structural, pharmacological, and chemical information on GPCR\u2013ligand interactions enables the extension of the structural GPCR\u2013ligand interactome and the structure-based design of novel modulators of GPCR function."

  "description": "COSMIN guideline for systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measuresPURPOSE: Systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) differ from reviews of interventions and diagnostic test accuracy studies and are complex. In fact, conducting a review of one or more PROMs comprises of multiple reviews (i.e., one review for each measurement property of each PROM). In the absence of guidance specifically designed for reviews on measurement properties, our aim was to develop a guideline for conducting systematic reviews of PROMs.METHODS: Based on literature reviews and expert opinions, and in concordance with existing guidelines, the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) steering committee developed a guideline for systematic reviews of PROMs.RESULTS: A consecutive ten-step procedure for conducting a systematic review of PROMs is proposed. Steps 1-4 concern preparing and performing the literature search, and selecting relevant studies. Steps 5-8 concern the evaluation of the quality of the eligible studies, the measurement properties, and the interpretability and feasibility aspects. Steps 9 and 10 concern formulating recommendations and reporting the systematic review.CONCLUSIONS: The COSMIN guideline for systematic reviews of PROMs includes methodology to combine the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties with the quality of the PROM itself (i.e., its measurement properties). This enables reviewers to draw transparent conclusions and making evidence-based recommendations on the quality of PROMs, and supports the evidence-based selection of PROMs for use in research and in clinical practice."

  "description": "The AmP project: Comparing species on the basis of dynamic energy budget parametersWe developed new methods for parameter estimation-in-context and, with the help of 125 authors, built the AmP (Add-my-Pet) database of Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models, parameters and referenced underlying data for animals, where each species constitutes one database entry. The combination of DEB parameters covers all aspects of energetics throughout the full organism\u2019s life cycle, from the start of embryo development to death by aging. The species-specific parameter values capture biodiversity and can now, for the first time, be compared between animals species. An important insight brought by the AmP project is the classification of animal energetics according to a family of related DEB models that is structured on the basis of the mode of metabolic acceleration, which links up with the development of larval stages. We discuss the evolution of metabolism in this context, among animals in general, and ray-finned fish, mollusks and crustaceans in particular. New DEBtool code for estimating DEB parameters from data has been written. AmPtool code for analyzing patterns in parameter values has also been created. A new web-interface supports multiple ways to visualize data, parameters, and implied properties from the entire collection as well as on an entry by entry basis. The DEB models proved to fit data well, the median relative error is only 0.07, for the 1035 animal species at 2018/03/12, including some extinct ones, from all large phyla and all chordate orders, spanning a range of body masses of 16 orders of magnitude. This study is a first step to include evolutionary aspects into parameter estimation, allowing to infer properties of species for which very little is known."

  "description": "Structural insights into serotonin receptor ligands polypharmacologyIdentifying desired interactions with a target receptor is often the first step when designing new active compounds. However, attention should also be focused on contacts with other proteins that result in either selective or polypharmacological compounds. Here, the search for the structural determinants of selectivity between selected serotonin receptor subtypes was carried out. Special attention was focused on 5-HT7R and the cross-interactions between its ligands and the 5-HT1AR, 5-HT1BR, 5-HT2AR, 5-HT2BR, and 5-HT6R subtypes. Selective and non-selective compounds for each pair of 5-HT7/5-HTx receptors were docked to the respective 5-HTR homology models and 5-HT1B/5-HT2BR crystal structures. The contacts present in the ligand-receptor complexes obtained by docking were characterized by the structural interaction fingerprint and statistically analyzed in terms of their frequency. The results allowed for the identification of amino acids that discriminate between selective and non-selective compounds for each 5-HT7/5-HTx receptor pair, which was further compared with available mutagenesis data. Interaction pattern characteristics for compounds with particular activity profiles can constitute the basis for the coherent selectivity theory within a considered set of proteins, supporting the ongoing development of new ligands targeting these receptors. The in silico results were used to analyze prospective virtual screening results towards the 5-HT7 receptor in which compounds of different chemotypes to known 5-HT7R ligands, with micromolar level activities were identified. The findings in this study not only confirm the legitimacy of the approach but also constitute a great starting point for further studies on 5-HT7R ligands selectivity."

One of these enzymes, Trypanosoma brucei PDE B1 (TbrPDEB1), is considered a drug target for the treatment of African sleeping sickness. Here, we elucidate the molecular determinants of inhibitor binding and reveal that the P-pocket is amenable to directed design. By iterative cycles of design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation and by elucidating the structures of inhibitor-bound TbrPDEB1, hPDE4B, and hPDE4D complexes, we have developed 4a,5,8,8a-tetrahydrophthalazinones as the first selective TbrPDEB1 inhibitor series. Two of these, 8 (NPD-008) and 9 (NPD-039), were potent (Ki = 100 nM) TbrPDEB1 inhibitors with antitrypanosomal effects (IC50 = 5.5 and 6.7 \u03bcM, respectively). Treatment of parasites with 8 caused an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and severe disruption of T. brucei cellular organization, chemically validating trypanosomal PDEs as therapeutic targets in trypanosomiasis."

  "description": "Aurora kinase A (AURKA) interaction with Wnt and Ras-MAPK signalling pathways in colorectal cancerHyperactivation of Wnt and Ras-MAPK signalling are common events in development of colorectal adenomas. Further progression from adenoma-to-carcinoma is frequently associated with 20q gain and overexpression of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). Interestingly, AURKA has been shown to further enhance Wnt and Ras-MAPK signalling. However, the molecular details of these interactions in driving colorectal carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. Here we first performed differential expression analysis (DEA) of AURKA knockdown in two colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines with 20q gain and AURKA overexpression. Next, using an exact algorithm, Heinz, we computed the largest connected protein-protein interaction (PPI) network module of significantly deregulated genes in the two CRC cell lines. The DEA and the Heinz analyses suggest 20 Wnt and Ras-MAPK signalling genes being deregulated by AURKA, whereof \u03b2-catenin and KRAS occurred in both cell lines. Finally, shortest path analysis over the PPI network revealed eight 'connecting genes' between AURKA and these Wnt and Ras-MAPK signalling genes, of which UBE2D1, DICER1, CDK6 and RACGAP1 occurred in both cell lines. This study, first, confirms that AURKA influences deregulation of Wnt and Ras-MAPK signalling genes, and second, suggests mechanisms in CRC cell lines describing these interactions."

During the initial method development, a variety of experimental conditions were screened. Subsequently, a Design of Experiments (DoE) was used to optimize the pH and concentration of the selected background electrolyte (BGE) containing both TRIS and boric acid. Optimization was performed taking into account both the separation efficiency of L-ASNase and its acidic variants as well as overall method robustness. A repeatable separation between E.coli L-ASNase and its acidic variants was achieved on a bare fused silica capillary in combination with a BGE consisting of both 400 mM TRIS and boric acid. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, LOD, LOQ and robustness. The recovery for L-ASNase was 97.9\u2013104.4% with a precision RSD of 1.5\u20133.2%, while the recovery of impurities was 92.1\u2013109.8% with a RSD of 1.7\u20134.6%. The quantification limit was 1.9% (m/m). Moreover, the CZE-UV method was applied to determine the degradation rate in the presence of ammonium bicarbonate, confirming the suitability of the method. The degraded, partially charged L-ASNase was evaluated for its in-vitro enzymatic activity showing an insignificant different enzyme activity compared to the unmodified sample."

  "description": "RNAi screening of subtracted transcriptomes reveals tumor suppression by taurine-activated GABAA receptors involved in volume regulationTo identify coding and non-coding suppressor genes of anchorage-independent proliferation by efficient loss-of-function screening, we have developed a method for enzymatic production of low complexity shRNA libraries from subtracted transcriptomes. We produced and screened two LEGO (Low-complexity by Enrichment for Genes shut Off) shRNA libraries that were enriched for shRNA vectors targeting coding and non-coding polyadenylated transcripts that were reduced in transformed Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs). The LEGO shRNA libraries included ~25 shRNA vectors per transcript which limited off-target artifacts. Our method identified 79 coding and non-coding suppressor transcripts. We found that taurine-responsive GABAA receptor subunits, including GABRA5 and GABRB3, were induced during the arrest of non-transformed anchor-deprived MEFs and prevented anchorless proliferation. We show that taurine activates chloride currents through GABAA receptors on MEFs, causing seclusion of cell volume in large membrane protrusions. Volume seclusion from cells by taurine correlated with reduced proliferation and, conversely, suppression of this pathway allowed anchorage-independent proliferation. In human cholangiocarcinomas, we found that several proteins involved in taurine signaling via GABAA receptors were repressed. Low GABRA5 expression typified hyperproliferative tumors, and loss of taurine signaling correlated with reduced patient survival, suggesting this tumor suppressive mechanism operates in vivo."

  "description": "Expanding the reach of probiotics through social enterprisesThe rapid rise in microbiome and probiotic science has led to estimates of product creation and sales exceeding $50 billion within five years. However, many people do not have access to affordable products, and regulatory agencies have stifled progress. The objective of a discussion group at the 2017 meeting of the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics was to identify mechanisms to confer the benefits of probiotics to a larger portion of the world's population. Three initiatives, built around fermented food, were discussed with different methods of targeting populations that face enormous challenges of malnutrition, infectious disease, poverty and violent conflict. As new candidate probiotic strains emerge, and the market diversifies towards more personalised interventions, manufacturing processes will need to evolve. Information dissemination through scientific channels and social media is projected to provide consumers and healthcare providers with rapid access to clinical results, and to identify the nearest location of sites making new and affordable probiotic food and supplements. This rapid translation of science to individual well-being will not only expand the beneficiaries of probiotics, but also fuel new social enterprises and economic business models."

  "description": "Phosphorus: Reserves, production, and applicationsThe demand of phosphate fertilizers is growing as a result of a rising population, changing human diets resulting in the increasing (meat) consumption per capita, and an expansion in the production of biofuels. Besides the fertilizer industry, there is a steady growth of using phosphorus compounds in the chemical industry for applications in, e.g., soft drinks, pharmaceuticals, and flame retardants. To meet this growth, it is important to know if the P reserves are sufficient and what kind of processes are used to produce such phosphorus compounds. Reserves are not equally spread around the world, with three-quarters located in Morocco and The Western Sahara. Prices can be volatile, as shown in 2008 with an eightfold price increase. Moreover, the estimated time till depletion of phosphate rock differs substantially between several studies. Therefore, phosphate rock was added on the critical material list of the European Commission. An important aspect for the processing of phosphate rock is the quality of the rock, which is dependent on the ore type (sedimentary or igneous), level of radioactivity, and hazardous metal contents. The main intermediary compounds for phosphorus products are phosphoric acid and white phosphorus. About 95% of the phosphoric acid is made via the wet process: acidulation of phosphate rock to create wet phosphoric acid and the main by-products phosphogypsum and hydrogen fluoride. The purity and thus the reusability of phosphogypsum are dependent on the type of digestion process. However, at the moment, reusing phosphogypsum is not a common practice. Wet phosphoric acid can be purified via several processes. The most common processes are extraction and precipitation. Via extraction, wet phosphoric acid can be purified up to phosphoric acid comparable to that produced with the thermal process. Separation of specific compounds can be done through precipitation. Additionally, cationic impurities can be removed via precipitation, but the product will then be changed into a phosphate salt, which is unfavorable for its use in industrial applications."

  "description": "An assessment of the drivers and barriers for the deployment of urban phosphorus recovery technologies: A case study of the NetherlandsPhosphorus (P), being one of the building blocks of life, is essential for a multitude of applications, primarily for fertilizer usage. Sustainable management of phosphorus is becoming increasingly important in light of adverse environmental effects, ambiguous reserves, increasing global demand and unilateral dependence. Recovery of phosphorus from the biggest loss stream, communal wastewater, has the potential to tackle each of these problems. The implementation of phosphorus recovery technologies at wastewater treatment plants is not widespread, despite prolonged efforts primarily done by researchers over the past decade. This study aimed to assess the drivers and barriers of a phosphorus recovery transition. Several key stakeholders involved in this transition in The Netherlands were interviewed. The Netherlands was taken as a case study, since it serves as a frontrunner in the implementation of phosphorus recovery technologies. This study shows that themain barriers from the point of view of fertilizer companies are the different and unclear characteristics of the phosphorus recovery product struvite compared to common fertilizers. Moreover, the end-of-waste status of struvite is mentioned as a prominent barrier for a phosphorus transition, since it hinders free market trade. Many water boards indicate that the main barrier is the high investment cost with an uncertain return on investment for onsite struvite recovery processes. The specifiedmain driver forwater boards for onsite struvite phosphorus recovery technology is the reduction of maintenance costs, and for phosphorus recovery from sewage sludge ash, the low organic pollutant in the P recovery product."

This new protocol combines two procedures based on magnetic beads in 96-well plate format. Protein complexes are captured by antibodies and magnetic beads conjugated with protein A. Proteins are washed and on-bead digested by using Single-Pot solid-phase sample preparation (SP3). The whole IP-SP3 approach can be completed in one day, which is considerably faster compared to the classical approach. No major quantitative differences are found between SP3 and FASP (filter-aided sample preparation) or a longer incubation protocol. Taken together, the IP-SP3 protocol is a fast and economical approach easily applicable for large-scale protein interactome analysis."

In vivo circular spectropolarimetry enables us to probe the molecular architecture of photosynthesis in a non-invasive and non-destructive way and, as such, can offer a wealth of physiological and structural information. In the present study, we have measured the circular polarizance of several multicellular green, red, and brown algae and higher plants, which show large variations in circular spectropolarimetric signals with differences in both spectral shape and magnitude. Many of the algae display spectral characteristics not previously reported, indicating a larger variation in molecular organization than previously assumed. As the strengths of these signals vary by three orders of magnitude, these results also have important implications in terms of detectability for the use of circular polarization as a signature of life."

  "description": "The role of analytical chemistry in exposure science: Focus on the aquatic environmentExposure science, in its broadest sense, studies the interactions between stressors (chemical, biological, and physical agents) and receptors (e.g. humans and other living organisms, and non-living items like buildings), together with the associated pathways and processes potentially leading to negative effects on human health and the environment. The aquatic environment may contain thousands of compounds, many of them still unknown, that can pose a risk to ecosystems and human health. Due to the unquestionable importance of the aquatic environment, one of the main challenges in the field of exposure science is the comprehensive characterization and evaluation of complex environmental mixtures beyond the classical/priority contaminants to new emerging contaminants. The role of advanced analytical chemistry to identify and quantify potential chemical risks, that might cause adverse effects to the aquatic environment, is essential. In this paper, we present the strategies and tools that analytical chemistry has nowadays, focused on chromatography hyphenated to (high-resolution) mass spectrometry because of its relevance in this field. Key issues, such as the application of effect direct analysis to reduce the complexity of the sample, the investigation of the huge number of transformation/degradation products that may be present in the aquatic environment, the analysis of urban wastewater as a source of valuable information on our lifestyle and substances we consumed and/or are exposed to, or the monitoring of drinking water, are discussed in this article. The trends and perspectives for the next few years are also highlighted, when it is expected that new developments and tools will allow a better knowledge of chemical composition in the aquatic environment. This will help regulatory authorities to protect water bodies and to advance towards improved regulations that enable practical and efficient abatements for environmental and public health protection."

  "description": "Water and health: From environmental pressures to integrated responsesThe water-related exposome is a significant determinant of human health. The disease burden through water results from water-associated communicable and non-communicable diseases and is influenced by water pollution with chemicals, solid waste (mainly plastics), pathogens, insects and other disease vectors. This paper analyses a range of water practitioner-driven health issues, including infectious diseases and chemical intoxication, using the conceptual framework of Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, and Responses (DPSIR), complemented with a selective literature review. Pressures in the environment result in changes in the State of the water body: chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the presence of vectors. These and other health hazards affect the State of human health. The resulting Impacts in an exposed population or affected ecosystem, in turn incite Responses. Pathways from Drivers to Impacts are quite divergent for chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, in vectors of disease and for the combined effects of plastics. Potential Responses from the water sector, however, show remarkable similarities. Integrated water management interventions have the potential to address Drivers, Pressures, Impacts, and State of several health issues at the same time. Systematic and integrated planning and management of water resources, with an eye for human health, could contribute to reducing or preventing negative health impacts and enhancing the health benefits."

  "description": "Sampling and pre-treatment effects on the quantification of (nano)silver and selected trace elements in surface water - Application in a Dutch case studyDetection and quantification of trace elements in aqueous samples is crucial in terms of environmental monitoring and risk assessment for (heavy) metals in the environment. Silver (Ag) in its nanoparticulate form is commonly used as antimicrobial additive in consumer products and pharmaceuticals. Since released dissolved Ag species act as the actual antimicrobial agent, Ag nanomaterials are supposed to pose risks to the environment by a release of dissolved species. Unfortunately, no standard protocols exist yet to gain reliable information about the presence and distribution of nanomaterials in the environment. Therefore, we present an interlaboratory collaboration involving three laboratories to quantify silver, silver based nanoparticles (Ag-b-NPs) and a wide range of relevant trace elements after different sample pre-treatments for profiling surface water of a Dutch channel. Besides quantification of the elements, different sample pretreatments like acidification, with or without filtration, and their effect on the measurable elemental content were studied. Total Ag and Ag-b-NPs were quantified at lower ng L\u22121 range in the channel water whereas reasonable differences depending on the pre-treatment were identified; Ba, As, Pb, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were detected at \u03bcg L\u22121 range and Na, K, Mg, Ca and Fe at mg L\u22121 range. Significant sample pre-treatment effects were observed for the elements Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn, which is very likely due to the existence of particulate species. Measured concentrations were well comparable among the three laboratories underpinning method validity and correctness allowing for a comprehensive, reliable risk assessment for nanomaterials in the environment."

BM3 mutants can serve as a model for human drug-metabolizing CYPs and/or as biocatalyst for selective formation of drug metabolites. Hence, molecular and computational biologists have in the last two decades shown strong interest in the discovery and design of novel BM3 variants with optimized activity and selectivity for substrate conversion. This led e.g. to the discovery of mutant M11 that is able to metabolize a variety of drugs and drug-like compounds with relatively high activity. In order to further improve our understanding of CYP binding and reactions, we performed a co-crystallization study of mutant M11 and report here the three-dimensional structure M11 in complex with dithiothreitol (DTT) at a resolution of 2.16 A. The structure shows that DTT can coordinate to the Fe atom in the heme group. UV/Vis spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation studies underline this finding and as first structure of the CYP BM3 mutant M11 in complex with a ligand, it offers a basis for structure-based design of novel mutants."

  "description": "The role of low molecular weight thiols in Mycobacterium tuberculosisLow molecular weight (LMW)thiols are molecules with a functional sulfhydryl group that enable them to detoxify reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species and other free radicals. Their roles range from their ability to modulate the immune system to their ability to prevent damage of biological molecules such as DNA and proteins by protecting against oxidative, nitrosative and acidic stress. LMW thiols are synthesized and found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Due to their beneficial role to both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, their specific functions need to be elucidated, most especially in pathogenic prokaryotes such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), in order to provide a rationale for targeting their biosynthesis for drug development. Ergothioneine (ERG), mycothiol (MSH)and gamma-glutamylcysteine (GGC)are LMW thiols that have been shown to interplay to protect M.tb against cellular stress. Though ERG, MSH and GGC seem to have overlapping functions, studies are gradually revealing their unique physiological roles. Understanding their unique physiological role during the course of tuberculosis (TB)infection, would pave the way for the development of drugs that target their biosynthetic pathway. This review identifies the knowledge gap in the unique physiological roles of LMW thiols and proposes their mechanistic roles based on previous studies. In addition, it gives an update on identified inhibitors of their biosynthetic enzymes."

The Mtb genome encodes twenty CYPs and nine associated redox partners required for CYP catalytic activity. Transposon insertion mutagenesis studies have established the (conditional) essentiality of several of these enzymes for in vitro growth and host infection. Biochemical characterization of a handful of Mtb CYPs has revealed that they have specific physiological functions in bacterial virulence and persistence in the host. Analysis of the transcriptional response of Mtb CYPs and redox partners to external insults and to first-line antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis showed a diverse expression landscape, suggesting for some enzymes a potential role in drug resistance. Combining the knowledge about the physiological roles and expression profiles indicates that, at least five Mtb CYPs, CYP121A1, CYP125A1, CYP139A1, CYP142A1, and CYP143A1, as well as two ferredoxins, FdxA and FdxC, can be considered promising novel therapeutic targets."

  "description": "Microbial communities in sediments from four mildly acidic ephemeral salt lakes in the Yilgarn craton (Australia) \u2013 terrestrial analogs to ancient MarsThe Yilgarn Craton in Australia has a large number of naturally occurring shallow ephemeral lakes underlain by a dendritic system of paleodrainage channels. Processes like evaporation, flooding, erosion, as well as inflow of saline, often acidic and ion-rich groundwater contribute to the (dynamic) nature of the lakes and the composition of the sediments. The region has previously been described as an analog environment for early Mars due to its geological and geophysical similarities. Here, we investigated sediment samples of four lake environments aimed at getting a fundamental understanding of the native microbial communities and the mineralogical and (bio)chemical composition of the sediments they are associated with. The dominant mineral phases in the sediments were quartz, feldspars and amphiboles, while halite and gypsum were the only evaporites detected. Element analysis revealed a rich and complex image, in which silicon, iron, and aluminum were the dominant ions, but relative high concentrations of trace elements such as strontium, chromium, zirconium, and barium were also found. The concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus were generally low. 16S amplicon sequencing on the Illumina platform showed the presence of diverse microbial communities in all four lake environments. We found that most of the communities were dominated by extremely halophilic Archaea of the Halobacteriaceae family. The dynamic nature of these lakes appears to influence the biological, biochemical, and geological components of the ecosystem to a large effect. Inter-and intra-lake variations in the distributions of microbial communities were significant, and could only to a minor degree be explained by underlying environmental conditions. The communities are likely significantly influenced by small scale local effects caused by variations in geological settings and dynamic interactions caused by aeolian transport and flooding and evaporation events."

The expression is derived from the zero-point-energy (ZPE) functional, which is valid if the quantum state reduces to strongly correlated electrons in the strong coupling limit. The explicit expression is confirmed numerically and respects the relevant sum rule. We also show that the ZPE potential is able to generate a bond midpoint peak for homonuclear dissociation and is properly of purely kinetic origin. Unfortunately, the ZPE diverges for Coulomb systems, whereas the exact peaks should be finite."

  "description": "Bacterial community dynamics in lait caill\u00e9, a traditional product of spontaneous fermentation from SenegalSpontaneously fermented food products contain a complex, natural microbial community with potential probiotic activity. The addition of a health-promoting, probiotic bacterium to these products ensures the delivery of that probiotic activity to consumers. Here, we assess the microbial community of a traditional Senegalese milk product produced by spontaneous fermentation, called lait caill\u00e9. We produced the lait caill\u00e9 in a traditional way and added a probiotic starter containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 to the traditional process. We found various species that are known for their ability to ferment milk, including species from the genera Lactobacillus, Acetobacter, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus. Our results show that the addition of L. rhamnosus to the inoculum, can result in detectable levels of this strain in the final product, ranging between 0.2 and 1 percent of the total bacterial population. Subsequent rounds of fermentation using passive back-slopping without the addition of new L. rhamnosus led to a loss of this strain from the community of fermenting bacteria. Our results suggest that the addition of probiotic strains at every fermentation cycle can enrich the existing complex communities of traditionally fermented lait caill\u00e9 while traditional bacterial strains remain dominant in the bacterial communities."

  "description": "The ability of transcription factors to differentially regulate gene expression is a crucial component of the mechanism underlying inversion, a frequently observed genetic interaction patternGenetic interactions, a phenomenon whereby combinations of mutations lead to unexpected effects, reflect how cellular processes are wired and play an important role in complex genetic diseases. Understanding the molecular basis of genetic interactions is crucial for deciphering pathway organization as well as understanding the relationship between genetic variation and disease. Several hypothetical molecular mechanisms have been linked to different genetic interaction types. However, differences in genetic interaction patterns and their underlying mechanisms have not yet been compared systematically between different functional gene classes. Here, differences in the occurrence and types of genetic interactions are compared for two classes, gene-specific transcription factors (GSTFs) and signaling genes (kinases and phospha-tases). Genome-wide gene expression data for 63 single and double deletion mutants in baker\u2019s yeast reveals that the two most common genetic interaction patterns are buffering and inversion. Buffering is typically associated with redundancy and is well understood. In inversion, genes show opposite behavior in the double mutant compared to the corresponding single mutants. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Although both classes show buffering and inversion patterns, the prevalence of inversion is much stronger in GSTFs. To decipher potential mechanisms, a Petri Net modeling approach was employed, where genes are represented as nodes and relationships between genes as edges. This allowed over 9 million possible three and four node models to be exhaustively enumerated. The models show that a quantitative difference in interaction strength is a strict requirement for obtaining inversion. In addition, this difference is frequently accompanied with a second gene that shows buffering. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic explanation for inversion. Furthermore, the ability of transcription factors to differentially regulate expression of their targets provides a likely explanation why inversion is more prevalent for GSTFs compared to kinases and phosphatases."

  "description": "Control of Surface Defects in ZnO Nanorod Arrays with Thermally Deposited Au Nanoparticles for Perovskite PhotovoltaicsIn this work, we employ vacuum deposited Au nanoparticles (-4 nm) to control the defect density on the surface of hydrothermally synthesized ZnO nanorod arrays (ZnO-NR), which are of interest for electron-transport layers in perovskite solar cells. Using a combination of photoluminescence spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, we show that the Au particles reduce the presence of defects in the ZnO-NR. We discuss this in terms of trap filling due to band bending at the ZnO-NR surface. As a proof-of-concept, we apply the Au-decorated ZnO-NR as electron-transport layers in mixed-cation and mixed-halide lead perovskite solar cells (Cs0.15FA0.85PbI2.75Br0.25). Devices prepared with the Au-decorated ZnO-NR electron-transport layers demonstrate higher open-circuit voltages and fill factors compared to solar cells prepared with pristine ZnO-NR, resulting in an increase in the power-conversion efficiency from 11.7 to 13.7%. However, the operational stability of the solar cells is not improved by the Au nanoparticles, indicating that bulk properties of the perovskite may limit device lifetime."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower than S-EDCs. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

It has been reported that implant failure occurs in approximately a tenth of patients within 10\u2009years, and the consequences of dissemination of silicone debris are poorly understood. Currently, silicone detection in histopathological slides is based on morphological features as no specific immunohistochemical technique is available. Here, we show the feasibility and sensitivity of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging to specifically detect silicone material in stained histopathological slides, without additional sample treatment. Histology slides of four periprosthetic capsules from different implant types were obtained after explantation, as well as an enlarged axillary lymph node from a patient with a ruptured implant. SRS images coregistered with bright-field images revealed the distribution and quantity of silicone material in the tissue. Fast and high-resolution imaging of histology slides with molecular specificity using SRS provides an opportunity to investigate the role of silicone debris in the pathophysiology of implant-linked diseases."

  "description": "Modification of a PE/PPE substrate pair reroutes an Esx substrate pair from the mycobacterial ESX-1 type VII secretion system to the ESX-5 systemBacterial type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) secrete a wide range of extracellular proteins that play important roles in bacterial viability and in interactions of pathogenic mycobacteria with their hosts. Mycobacterial T7SSs consist of five subtypes, ESX-1-5, and have four substrate classes, namely, Esx, PE, PPE, and Esp proteins. At least some of these substrates are secreted as heterodimers. Each ESX system mediates the secretion of a specific set of Esx, PE, and PPE proteins, raising the question how these substrates are recognized in a system-specific fashion. For the PE/PPE heterodimers, it has been shown that they interact with their cognate EspG chaperone and that this chaperone determines the designated secretion pathway. However, both structural and pulldown analyses have suggested that EspG cannot interact with the Esx proteins. Therefore, the determining factor for system specificity of the Esx proteins remains unknown. Here, we investigated the secretion specificity of the ESX-1 substrate pair EsxB_1/EsxA_1 in Mycobacterium marinum While this substrate pair was hardly secreted when homologously expressed, it was secreted when co-expressed together with the PE35/PPE68_1 pair, indicating that this pair could stimulate secretion of the EsxB_1/EsxA_1 pair. Surprisingly, co-expression of EsxB_1/EsxA_1 with a modified PE35/PPE68_1 version that carried the EspG5 chaperone-binding domain, previously shown to redirect this substrate pair to the ESX-5 system, also resulted in redirection and co-secretion of the Esx pair via ESX-5. Our results suggest a secretion model in which PE35/PPE68_1 determines the system-specific secretion of EsxB_1/EsxA_1."

  "description": "Pre-exascale accelerated application development: The ORNL Summit experienceHigh-performance computing (HPC) increasingly relies on heterogeneous architectures to achieve higher performance. In the Oak Ridge Leadership Facility (OLCF), Oak Ridge, TN, USA, this trend continues as its latest supercomputer, Summit, entered production in early 2019. The combination of IBM POWER9 CPU and NVIDIA V100 GPU, along with a fast NVLink2 interconnect and other latest technologies, pushes system performance to a new height and breaks the exascale barrier by certain measures. Due to Summit's powerful GPUs and much higher GPU-CPU ratio, offloading to accelerators becomes a requirement for any application, which intends to effectively use the system. To facilitate navigating a complex landscape of competing heterogeneous architectures, a collection of applications from a wide spectrum of scientific domains is selected for early adoption on Summit. In this article, the experience and lessons learned are summarized, in the hope of providing useful guidance to address new programming challenges, such as scalability, performance portability, and software maintainability, for future application development efforts on heterogeneous HPC systems."

  "description": "Profiling of a high mannose-type N-glycosylated lipase using hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometryMany industrial enzymes exhibit macro- and micro-heterogeneity due to co-occurring post-translational modifications. The resulting proteoforms may have different activity and stability and, therefore, the characterization of their distributions is of interest in the development and monitoring of enzyme products. Protein glycosylation may play a critical role as it can influence the expression, physical and biochemical properties of an enzyme. We report the use of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) to profile intact glycoform distributions of high mannose-type N-glycosylated proteins, using an industrially produced fungal lipase for the food industry as an example. We compared these results with conventional reversed phase LC-MS (RPLC-MS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). HILIC appeared superior in resolving lipase heterogeneity, facilitating mass assignment of N-glycoforms and sequence variants. In order to understand the glycoform selectivity provided by HILIC, fractions from the four main HILIC elution bands for lipase were taken and subjected to SDS-PAGE and bottom-up proteomic analysis. These analyses enabled the identification of the most abundant glycosylation sites present in each fraction and corroborated the capacity of HILIC to separate protein glycoforms based on the number of glycosylation sites occupied. Compared to RPLC-MS, HILIC-MS reducted the sample complexity delivered to the mass spectrometer, facilitating the assignment of the masses of glycoforms and sequence variants as well as increasing the number of glycoforms detected (69 more proteoforms, 177% increase). The HILIC-MS method required relatively short analysis time (<30 min), in which over 100 glycoforms were distinguished. We suggest that HILIC(-MS) can be a valuable tool in characterizing bioengineering processes aimed at steering protein glycoform expression as well as to check the consistency of product batches."

  "description": "Safeguarding female reproductive health against endocrine disrupting chemicals\u2014The FREIA projectCurrently available test methods are not well-suited for the identification of chemicals that disturb hormonal processes involved in female reproductive development and function. This renders women\u2019s reproductive health at increasing risk globally, which, coupled with increasing incidence rates of reproductive disorders, is of great concern. A woman\u2019s reproductive health is largely established during embryonic and fetal development and subsequently matures during puberty. The endocrine system influences development, maturation, and function of the female reproductive system, thereby making appropriate hormone levels imperative for correct functioning of reproductive processes. It is concerning that the effects of human-made chemicals on the endocrine system and female reproductive health are poorly addressed in regulatory chemical safety assessment, partly because adequate test methods are lacking. Our EU-funded project FREIA aims to address this need by increasing understanding of how endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can impact female reproductive health. We will use this information to provide better test methods that enable fit-for-purpose chemical regulation and then share our knowledge, promote a sustainable society, and improve the reproductive health of women globally."

  "description": "Signaling lipids as diagnostic biomarkers for ocular surface cicatrizing conjunctivitisAbstract: Metabolomics has been applied to diagnose diseases, predict disease progression, and design therapeutic strategies in various areas of medicine. However, it remains to be applied to the ocular surface diseases, where biological samples are often of limited quantities. We successfully performed proof-of-concept metabolomics assessment of volume-limited cytology samples from a clinical form of chronic inflammatory cicatrizing conjunctivitis, i.e., ocular MMP and discovered metabolic changes of signaling lipid mediators upon disease onset and progression. The metabolomics assessment revealed active oxylipins, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and endocannabinoids alterations, from which potential biomarkers linked to inflammatory processes were identified. Possible underlying mechanisms such as dysregulated enzyme activities (e.g., lipoxygenases, cytochrome P450, and phospholipases) were suggested which may be considered as potential therapeutic targets in future studies. Key messages: Metabolic profile of the ocular surface can be measured using impression cytology samples.Metabolomics analysis of ocular pemphigoid is presented for the first time.The metabolomics assessment of OCP patients revealed active oxylipins, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and endocannabinoids alterations.Several oxylipins are identified as diagnostic biomarkers for OCP."

  "description": "You Are What You Eat, Microplastics in Porbeagle Sharks From the North East Atlantic: Method Development and Analysis in Spiral Valve Content and TissueResearchers worldwide are studying the environmental distribution and impacts of manufactured or environmentally fragmented small pieces of plastics, so called microplastics (<5 mm). These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the North-East Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators."

This is a compact, two-lens illumination system with a constant power objective lens, without any energy filters or aberration correctors, often thought of as a \u201cscreening cryo-microscope\u201d. Coulomb potential maps reveal clear densities for main chain carbonyl oxygens, residue side chains (including alternative conformations) and bound solvent molecules. We used a quasi-crystallographic reciprocal space approach to fit model coordinates to the experimental cryo-EM map. We argue that the advantages offered by (a) the high electronic and mechanical stability of the microscope, (b) the high emission stability and low beam energy spread of the high brightness Field Emission Gun (X-FEG), (c) direct electron detection technology and (d) particle-based Contrast Transfer Function (CTF) refinement have contributed to achieving high resolution. Overall, we show that basic electron optical settings for automated cryo-electron microscopy imaging can be used to determine structures approaching atomic resolution."

  "description": "A histone-like motif in yellow fever virus contributes to viral replicationThe mimicry of host proteins by viruses contributes to their ability to suppress antiviral immunity and hijack host biosynthetic machinery. Host adaptation to evade this exploitation depends on host protein functional redundancy. Non-redundant, essential host proteins have limited potential to adapt without severe consequences. Histones, which are essential for genome architecture and control of gene expression, are among the most evolutionary conserved proteins. Here we show that the capsid protein of the flavivirus yellow fever virus (YFV), mimics histone H4 and interferes with chromatin gene regulation by BRD4, a bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein. Two acetyl-lysine residues of YFV capsid are embedded in a histone-like motif that interacts with the BRD4 bromodomain, affecting gene expression and influencing YFV replication. These findings reveal histone mimicry as a strategy employed by an RNA virus that replicates in the cytosol and define convergent and distinct molecular determinants for motif recognition of the viral mimic versus histone H4.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest."

  "description": "Preclinical validation of a repurposed metal chelator as an early-intervention therapeutic for hemotoxic snakebiteSnakebite envenoming causes 138,000 deaths annually, and ~400,000 victims are left with permanent disabilities. Envenoming by saw-scaled vipers (Viperidae: Echis) leads to systemic hemorrhage and coagulopathy and represents a major cause of snakebite mortality and morbidity in Africa and Asia. The only specific treatment for snakebite, antivenom, has poor specificity and low affordability and must be administered in clinical settings because of its intravenous delivery and high rates of adverse reactions. This requirement results in major treatment delays in resource-poor regions and substantially affects patient outcomes after envenoming. Here, we investigated the value of metal ion chelators as prehospital therapeutics for snakebite. Among the tested chelators, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) and its derivative 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) were found to potently antagonize the activity of Zn2+-dependent snake venom metalloproteinases in vitro. Moreover, DMPS prolonged or conferred complete survival in murine preclinical models of envenoming against a variety of saw-scaled viper venoms. DMPS also considerably extended survival in a \"challenge and treat\" model, where drug administration was delayed after venom injection and the oral administration of this chelator provided partial protection against envenoming. Last, the potential clinical scenario of early oral DMPS therapy combined with a delayed, intravenous dose of conventional antivenom provided prolonged protection against the lethal effects of envenoming in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that the safe and affordable repurposed metal chelator DMPS can effectively neutralize saw-scaled viper venoms in vitro and in vivo and highlight the promise of this drug as an early, prehospital, therapeutic intervention for hemotoxic snakebite envenoming."

We show that addition of butylamine to a nanoplatelet (NPL) dispersion maximally displaces \u223c40% of the original Cd(Ol)2 capping. On the basis of density functional theory simulations, we argue that this behavior reflects the preferential displacement of Cd(Ol)2 from (near)-edge surface sites. Opposite from CdSe core NPLs, core/crown NPL dispersions can retain 45% of their initial photoluminescence efficiency after ligand displacement, while radiative exciton recombination keeps dominating the luminescent decay. Using electron microscopy observations, we assign this robust photoluminescence to NPLs with a complete CdS crown, which prevents charge carrier trapping in the near-edge surface sites created by ligand displacement. We conclude that Z-type ligands such as cadmium carboxylates can provide full electronic passivation of (100) facets yet are prone to displacement from (near)-edge surface sites."

  "description": "Combining Protein Ligation Systems to Expand the Functionality of Semi-Synthetic Outer Membrane Vesicle NanoparticlesBacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) attract increasing interest as immunostimulatory nanoparticles for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents. We previously engineered the autotransporter protein Hemoglobin protease (Hbp) into a surface display carrier that can be expressed to high density on the surface of Salmonella OMVs. Moreover, we implemented Tag-Catcher protein ligation technology, to obtain dense display of single heterologous antigens and nanobodies on the OMVs through coupling to the distal end of the Hbp passenger domain. Here, we aimed to further expand the versatility of the Hbp platform by enabling the coupling of heterologous proteins to internal sites of the Hbp passenger. Inserted SpyTags were shown to be accessible at the Salmonella OMV surface and to efficiently couple SpyCatcher-equipped fusion proteins. Next, we combined distally placed SnoopCatcher or SnoopTag sequences with internal SpyTags in a single Hbp molecule. This allowed the coupling of two heterologous proteins to a single Hbp carrier molecule without obvious steric hindrance effects. Since coupling occurs to Hbp that is already exposed on the OMVs, there are no limitations to the size and complexity of the partner proteins. In conclusion, we constructed a versatile modular platform for the development of bivalent recombinant OMV-based vaccines and therapeutics."

  "description": "Quantitative analysis of amino acid metabolism in liver cancer links glutamate excretion to nucleotide synthesisMany cancer cells consume glutamine at high rates; counterintuitively, they simultaneously excrete glutamate, the first intermediate in glutamine metabolism. Glutamine consumption has been linked to replenishment of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates and synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but the reason for glutamate excretion is unclear. Here, we dynamically profile the uptake and excretion fluxes of a liver cancer cell line (HepG2) and use genome-scale metabolic modeling for in-depth analysis. We find that up to 30% of the glutamine is metabolized in the cytosol, primarily for nucleotide synthesis, producing cytosolic glutamate. We hypothesize that excreting glutamate helps the cell to increase the nucleotide synthesis rate to sustain growth. Indeed, we show experimentally that partial inhibition of glutamate excretion reduces cell growth. Our integrative approach thus links glutamine addiction to glutamate excretion in cancer and points toward potential drug targets."

  "description": "A Modified Arrhenius Approach to Thermodynamically Study Regioselectivity in Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Substrate ConversionThe regio- (and stereo-)selectivity and specific activity of cytochrome P450s are determined by the accessibility of potential sites of metabolism (SOMs) of the bound substrate relative to the heme, and the activation barrier of the regioselective oxidation reaction(s). The accessibility of potential SOMs depends on the relative binding free energy (\u0394\u0394Gbind) of the catalytically active substrate-binding poses, and the probability of the substrate to adopt a transition-state geometry. An established experimental method to measure activation energies of enzymatic reactions is the analysis of reaction rate constants at different temperatures and the construction of Arrhenius plots. This is a challenge for multistep P450-catalyzed processes that involve redox partners. We introduce a modified Arrhenius approach to overcome the limitations in studying P450 selectivity, which can be applied in multiproduct enzyme catalysis. Our approach gives combined information on relative activation energies, \u0394\u0394Gbind values, and collision entropies, yielding direct insight into the basis of selectivity in substrate conversion."

Using an inducible auxin-degron system to rapidly deplete RPB1 (the largest subunit of RNA Pol II) in living cells, we identified Pol II as a direct gene-specific regulator of tRNA transcription. Our data suggest that Pol II transcription robustly interferes with Pol III function at specific tRNA genes. This activity was further found to be essential for MAF1-mediated repression of a large set of tRNA genes during serum starvation, indicating that repression of tRNA genes by Pol II is dynamically regulated. Hence, Pol II plays a direct and central role in the gene-specific regulation of tRNA expression."

However, recent evidence suggests that some elapid snake venoms contain anticoagulant toxins which may help neurotoxic components spread more rapidly. This study examines the effects of venom from the West African black-necked spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis) on blood coagulation and identifies potential coagulopathic toxins. An integrated RPLC-MS methodology, coupled with nanofractionation, was first used to separate venom components, followed by MS, proteomics and coagulopathic bioassays. Coagulation assays were performed on both crude and nanofractionated N. nigricollis venom toxins as well as PLA2s and 3FTx purified from the venom. Assays were then repeated with the addition of either the phospholipase A2 inhibitor varespladib or the snake venom metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat to assess whether either toxin inhibitor is capable of neutralizing coagulopathic venom activity. Subsequent proteomic analysis was performed on nanofractionated bioactive venom toxins using tryptic digestion followed by nanoLC-MS/MS measurements, which were then identified using Swiss-Prot and species-specific database searches. Varespladib, but not marimastat, was found to significantly reduce the anticoagulant activity of N. nigricollis venom and MS and proteomics analyses confirmed that the anticoagulant venom components mostly consisted of PLA2 proteins. We, therefore, conclude that PLA2s are the most likely candidates responsible for anticoagulant effects stimulated by N. nigricollis venom."

  "description": "Evaluation of chemicals of environmental concern in crumb rubber and water leachates from several types of synthetic turf football pitchesNowadays concern exists about the safety for both football players and the environment of recycled tire rubber used as infill in synthetic turf football pitches. In this study 40 target compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), plasticizers, antioxidants and vulcanization agents were determined in 50 synthetic football pitches of diverse characteristics to estimate environmental risks. This is the first study of crumb rubber sport facilities in Portugal. Analyses were performed by ultrasound-assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UAE-GC-MS/MS). To evaluate the transfer of the target chemicals from the crumb rubber to the runoff water, water leachates collected from several football pitches were analyzed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME-GC-MS/MS). In addition, lab-scale runoff simulation experiments were performed to assess whether a persistent inflow of the target compounds from the football pitches into the runoff water wcould exist. Results revealed the presence of most of the target PAHs in crumb rubber at total concentrations up to 57 \u03bcg g\u22121, next to a high number of plasticizers and vulcanization agents. Runoff water collected from the football pitches contained up to 13 PAHs as well as other chemicals of environmental concern. In addition, continuous leaching of chemicals from the crumb rubber to the surrounding water was demonstrated. The transfer of target chemicals into the runoff water poses a potential risk for the aquatic environment."

  "description": "Lysosome-targeted photodynamic treatment induces primary keratinocyte differentiationPhotodynamic therapy is an attractive technique for various skin tumors and non-cancerous skin lesions. However, while the aim of photodynamic therapy is to target and damage only the malignant cells, it unavoidably affects some of the healthy cells surrounding the tumor as well. However, data on the effects of PDT to normal cells are scarce, and the characterization of the pathways activated after the photodamage of normal cells may help to improve clinical photodynamic therapy. In our study, primary human epidermal keratinocytes were used to evaluate photodynamic treatment effects of photosensitizers with different subcellular localization. We compared the response of keratinocytes to lysosomal photodamage induced by phthalocyanines, aluminum phthalocyanine disulfonate (AlPcS2a) or aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AlPcS4), and cellular membrane photodamage by m-tetra(3-hydroxyphenyl)-chlorin (mTHPC). Our data showed that mTHPC-PDT promoted autophagic flux, whereas lysosomal photodamage induced by aluminum phthalocyanines evoked differentiation and apoptosis. Photodamage by AlPcS2a, which is targeted to lysosomal membranes, induced keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis more efficiently than AlPcS4, which is targeted to lysosomal lumen. Computational analysis of the interplay between these molecular pathways revealed that keratin 10 is the coordinating molecular hub of primary keratinocyte differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy."

  "description": "Understanding FBA solutions under multiple nutrient limitationsGenome-scale stoichiometric modeling methods, in particular Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and variations thereof, are widely used to investigate cell metabolism and to optimize biotechno-logical processes. Given (1) a metabolic network, which can be reconstructed from an organism\u2019s genome sequence, and (2) constraints on reaction rates, which may be based on measured nutrient uptake rates, FBA predicts which reactions maximize an objective flux, usually the production of cell components. Although FBA solutions may accurately predict the metabolic behavior of a cell, the actual flux predictions are often hard to interpret. This is especially the case for conditions with many constraints, such as for organisms growing in rich nutrient environments: it remains unclear why a certain solution was optimal. Here, we rationalize FBA solutions by explaining for which properties the optimal combination of metabolic strategies is selected. We provide a graphical formalism in which the selection of solutions can be visualized; we illustrate how this perspective provides a glimpse of the logic that underlies genome-scale modeling by applying our formalism to models of various sizes."

  "description": "Bioactivation of trichloroethylene to three regioisomeric glutathione conjugates by liver fractions and recombinant human glutathione transferases: Species differences and implications for human risk assessmentEnzymatic conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to trichloroethylene (TCE) followed by catabolism to the corresponding cysteine-conjugate, S-(dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), and subsequent bioactivation by renal cysteine conjugate beta-lyases is considered to play an important role in the nephrotoxic effects observed in TCE-exposed rat and human. In this study, it is shown for the first time that three regioisomers of GSH-conjugates of TCE are formed by rat and human liver fractions, namely S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)-glutathione (1,2-trans-DCVG), S-(1,2-cis-dichlorovinyl)-glutathione (1,2-cis-DCVG) and S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-glutathione (2,2-DCVG). In incubations of TCE with rat liver fractions their amounts decreased in order of 1,2-cis-DCVG > 1,2-trans-DCVG > 2,2-DCVG. Human liver cytosol showed a more than 10-fold lower activity of GSH-conjugation, with amounts of regioisomers decreasing in order 2,2-DCVG > 1,2-trans-DCVG > 1,2-cis-DCVG. Incubations with recombinant human GSTs suggest that GSTA1-1 and GSTA2-2 play the most important role in human liver cytosol. GSTP1-1, which produces regioisomers in order 1,2-trans-DCVG > 2,2-cis-DCVG > 1,2-cis-DCVG, is likely to contribute to extrahepatic GSH-conjugation of TCE. Analysis of the products formed by a beta-lyase mimetic model showed that both 1,2-trans-DCVC and 1,2-cis-DCVC are converted to reactive products that form cross-links between the model nucleophile 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)-pyridine (NBP) and thiol-species. No NBP-alkylation was observed with 2,2-DCVC corresponding to its low cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. The lower activity of GSH-conjugation of TCE by human liver fractions, in combination with the lower fraction of potential nephrotoxic and mutagenic 1,2-DCVG-isomers, suggest that humans are at much lower risk for TCE-associated nephrotoxic effects than rats."

  "description": "IL-1R1-Dependent Signals Improve Control of Cytosolic Virulent Mycobacteria In VivoMycobacterium tuberculosis infections claim more than a million lives each year, and better treatments or vaccines are required. A crucial pathogenicity factor is translocation from phagolysosomes to the cytosol upon phagocytosis by macrophages. Translocation from the phagolysosome to the cytosol is an ESX-1-dependent process, as previously shown in vitro Here, we show that in vivo, mycobacteria also translocate to the cytosol but mainly when host immunity is compromised. We observed only low numbers of cytosolic bacilli in mice, armadillos, zebrafish, and patient material infected with M. tuberculosis, M. marinum, or M. leprae In contrast, when innate or adaptive immunity was compromised, as in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1)-deficient mice, significant numbers of cytosolic M. tuberculosis bacilli were detected in the lungs of infected mice. Taken together, in vivo, translocation to the cytosol of M. tuberculosis is controlled by adaptive immune responses as well as IL-1R1-mediated signals.IMPORTANCE For decades, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been one of the deadliest pathogens known. Despite infecting approximately one-third of the human population, no effective treatment or vaccine is available. A crucial pathogenicity factor is subcellular localization, as M. tuberculosis can translocate from phagolysosome to the cytosol in macrophages. The situation in vivo is more complicated. In this study, we establish that high-level cytosolic escape of mycobacteria can indeed occur in vivo but mainly when host resistance is compromised. The IL-1 pathway is crucial for the control of the number of cytosolic mycobacteria. The establishment that immune signals result in the clearance of cells containing cytosolic mycobacteria connects two important fields, cell biology and immunology, which is vital for the understanding of the pathology of M. tuberculosis."

The methodology exhibits a high degree of functional group tolerance around the forming hydroquinazoline aryl core and wide structural variance on the nucleophilic N atom of the urea moiety. Excellent yields (up to 99%) and high enantioselectivities (up to 97\u2009:\u20093 er) using both aromatic and less acidic aliphatic ureas were realized. The potential industrial applicability of the transformation was demonstrated in a 20 mmol scale-up experiment using an adjusted catalyst loading of 2 mol%. The origin of enantioselectivity and reactivity enhancement provided by the squaramide motif has been uncovered computationally using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, combined with the activation strain model (ASM) and energy decomposition analysis (EDA).

  "description": "SeRenDIP-CE: Sequence-based Interface Prediction for Conformational EpitopesMOTIVATION: Antibodies play an important role in clinical research and biotechnology, with their specificity determined by the interaction with the antigen's epitope region, as a special type of protein-protein interaction (PPI) interface. The ubiquitous availability of sequence data, allows us to predict epitopes from sequence in order to focus time-consuming wet-lab experiments towards the most promising epitope regions. Here, we extend our previously developed sequence-based predictors for homodimer and heterodimer PPI interfaces to predict epitope residues that have the potential to bind an antibody.RESULTS: We collected and curated a high quality epitope dataset from the SAbDab database. Our generic PPI heterodimer predictor obtained an AUC-ROC of 0.666 when evaluated on the epitope test set. We then trained a random forest model specifically on the epitope dataset, reaching AUC 0.694. Further training on the combined heterodimer and epitope datasets, improves our final predictor to AUC 0.703 on the epitope test set. This is better than the best state-of-the-art sequence-based epitope predictor BepiPred-2.0. On one solved antibody-antigen structure of the COVID19 virus spike RNA binding domain, our predictor reaches AUC 0.778. We added the SeRenDIP-CE Conformational Epitope predictors to our webserver, which is simple to use and only requires a single antigen sequence as input, which will help make the method immediately applicable in a wide range of biomedical and biomolecular research.AVAILABILITY: Webserver, source code and datasets at www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/serendipwww/."

  "description": "Exploring the Effect of Cyclization of Histamine H1Receptor Antagonists on Ligand Binding KineticsThere is an increasing interest in guiding hit optimization by considering the target binding kinetics of ligands. However, compared to conventional structure-activity relationships, structure-kinetics relationships have not been as thoroughly explored, even for well-studied archetypical drug targets such as the histamine H1 receptor (H1R), a member of the family A G-protein coupled receptor. In this study, we show that the binding kinetics of H1R antagonists at the H1R is dependent on the cyclicity of both the aromatic head group and the amine moiety of H1R ligands, the chemotypes that are characteristic for the first-generation H1R antagonists. Fusing the two aromatic rings of H1R ligands into one tricyclic aromatic head group prolongs the H1R residence time for benchmark H1R ligands as well as for tailored synthetic analogues. The effect of constraining the aromatic rings and the basic amines is systematically explored, leading to a coherent series and detailed discussions of structure-kinetics relationships. This study shows that cyclicity has a pronounced effect on the binding kinetics. "

  "description": "Characterization of a liquid-core waveguide cell for studying the chemistry of light-induced degradationMany organic compounds undergo changes under the influence of light. This might be beneficial in, for example, water purification, but undesirable when cultural-heritage objects fade or when food ingredients (e.g., vitamins) degrade. It is often challenging to establish a strong link between photodegradation products and their parent molecules due to the complexity of the sample. To allow effective study of light-induced degradation (LID), a low-volume exposure cell was created in which solutes are efficiently illuminated (especially at low concentrations) while simultaneously analysed by absorbance spectroscopy. The new LID cell encompasses a gas-permeable liquid-core waveguide (LCW) connected to a spectrograph allowing collection of spectral data in real-time. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the overall performance of the LID cell by assessing its transmission characteristics, the absolute photon flux achieved in the LCW, and its capacity to study solute degradation in presence of oxygen. The potential of the LID set-up for light-exposure studies was successfully demonstrated by monitoring the degradation of the dyes eosin Y and crystal violet."

Here we construct accurate models for the description of NCIs by an interpolation along the M\u00f8ller-Plesset adiabatic connection (MP AC). Our interpolation approximates the correlation energy, by recovering MP2 at small coupling strengths and the correct large-coupling strength expansion of the MP AC, recently shown to be a functional of the Hartree-Fock density. Our models are size consistent for fragments with nondegenerate ground states, have the same cost as double hybrids, and require no dispersion corrections to capture NCIs accurately. These interpolations greatly reduce large MP2 errors for typical \u03c0-stacking complexes (e.g., benzene-pyridine dimers) and for the L7 data set. They are also competitive with state-of-the-art dispersion enhanced functionals and can even significantly outperform them for a variety of data sets, such as CT7 and L7."

  "description": "HapCol: Accurate and memory-efficient haplotype assembly from long readsMotivation: Haplotype assembly is the computational problem of reconstructing haplotypes in diploid organisms and is of fundamental importance for characterizing the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the expression of phenotypic traits. Haplotype assembly highly benefits from the advent of 'future-generation' sequencing technologies and their capability to produce long reads at increasing coverage. Existing methods are not able to deal with such data in a fully satisfactory way, either because accuracy or performances degrade as read length and sequencing coverage increase or because they are based on restrictive assumptions. Results: By exploiting a feature of future-generation technologies - the uniform distribution of sequencing errors - we designed an exact algorithm, called HapCol, that is exponential in the maximum number of corrections for each single-nucleotide polymorphism position and that minimizes the overall error-correction score. We performed an experimental analysis, comparing HapCol with the current state-of-the-art combinatorial methods both on real and simulated data. On a standard benchmark of real data, we show that HapCol is competitive with state-of-the-art methods, improving the accuracy and the number of phased positions. Furthermore, experiments on realistically simulated datasets revealed that HapCol requires significantly less computing resources, especially memory. Thanks to its computational efficiency, HapCol can overcome the limits of previous approaches, allowing to phase datasets with higher coverage and without the traditional all-heterozygous assumption.

However, a generic software framework for simulating BioPAX models is missing. Here, we attempt to fill this gap by introducing a generic simulation framework for BioPAX. The framework explicitly separates the execution model from the model structure as provided by BioPAX, with the advantage that the modelling process becomes more reproducible and intrinsically more modular; this ensures natural biological constraints are satisfied upon execution. The framework is based on the principles of discrete event systems and multi-agent systems, and is capable of automatically generating a hierarchical multi-agent system for a given BioPAX model. RESULTS To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, we simulated two types of biological network models: a gene regulatory network modeling the haematopoietic stem cell regulators and a signal transduction network modeling the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. We observed that the results of the simulations performed using our framework were entirely consistent with the simulation results reported by the researchers who developed the original models in a proprietary language. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION The framework, implemented in Java, is open source and its source code, documentation and tutorial are available at http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/BioASF CONTACT: j.heringa@vu.nl."

  "description": "Structure of the mycobacterial ESX-5 type VII secretion system membrane complex by single-particle analysisMycobacteria are characterized by their impermeable outer membrane, which is rich in mycolic acids 1. To transport substrates across this complex cell envelope, mycobacteria rely on type VII (also known as ESX) secretion systems 2. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, these ESX systems are essential for growth and full virulence and therefore represent an attractive target for anti-tuberculosis drugs 3. However, the molecular details underlying type VII secretion are largely unknown, due to a lack of structural information. Here, we report the molecular architecture of the ESX-5 membrane complex from Mycobacterium xenopi determined at 13\u00e2 ...\u00c5 resolution by electron microscopy. The four core proteins of the ESX-5 complex (EccB 5, EccC 5, EccD 5 and EccE 5) assemble with equimolar stoichiometry into an oligomeric assembly that displays six-fold symmetry. This membrane-associated complex seems to be embedded exclusively in the inner membrane, which indicates that additional components are required to translocate substrates across the mycobacterial outer membrane. Furthermore, the extended cytosolic domains of the EccC ATPase, which interact with secretion effectors, are highly flexible, suggesting an as yet unseen mode of substrate interaction. Comparison of our results with known structures of other bacterial secretion systems demonstrates that the architecture of type VII secretion system is fundamentally different, suggesting an alternative secretion mechanism."

  "description": "Benzene degradation in a denitrifying biofilm reactor: activity and microbial community compositionBenzene is an aromatic compound and harmful for the environment. Biodegradation of benzene can reduce the toxicological risk after accidental or controlled release of this chemical in the environment. In this study, we further characterized an anaerobic continuous biofilm culture grown for more than 14years on benzene with nitrate as electron acceptor. We determined steady state degradation rates, microbial community composition dynamics in the biofilm, and the initial anaerobic benzene degradation reactions. Benzene was degraded at a rate of 0.15\u03bcmol/mgprotein/day and a first-order rate constant of 3.04/day which was fourfold higher than rates reported previously. Bacteria belonging to the Peptococcaceae were found to play an important role in this anaerobic benzene-degrading biofilm culture, but also members of the Anaerolineaceae were predicted to be involved in benzene degradation or benzene metabolite degradation based on Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Biomass retention in the reactor using a filtration finger resulted in reduction of benzene degradation capacity. Detection of the benzene carboxylase encoding gene, abcA, and benzoic acid in the culture vessel indicated that benzene degradation proceeds through an initial carboxylation step."

  "description": "Haemotoxic snake venoms: their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promiseSnake venoms are mixtures of numerous proteinacious components that exert diverse functional activities on a variety of physiological targets. Because the toxic constituents found in venom vary from species to species, snakebite victims can present with a variety of life-threatening pathologies related to the neurotoxic, cytotoxic and haemotoxic effects of venom. Of the 1\u00b78 million people envenomed by snakes every year, up to 125000 die, while hundreds of thousands survive only to suffer with life-changing long-term morbidity. Consequently, snakebite is one of the world's most severe neglected tropical diseases. Many snake venoms exhibit strong haemotoxic properties by interfering with blood pressure, clotting factors and platelets, and by directly causing haemorrhage. In this review we provide an overview of the functional activities of haemotoxic venom proteins, the pathologies they cause in snakebite victims and how their exquisite selectivity and potency make them amenable for use as therapeutic and diagnostic tools relevant for human medicine."

Herein, we report selective first steps by reacting P4 with a metal anion [Cp*Fe(CO)2]\u2212 (Cp*=C5(CH3)5), which, in the presence of bulky Lewis acids (LA; B(C6F5)3 or BPh3), leads to unique TM-substituted LA-stabilized bicyclo[1.1.0]tetraphosphabutanide anions [Cp*Fe(CO)2(\u03b71-P4\u22c5LA)]\u2212.

We generated low-density networks of hPSC-derived GABAergic and glutamatergic cortical neurons. We used two different co-culture models with astrocytes. We show that these cultures have balanced excitatory-inhibitory synaptic identities using confocal microscopy, electrophysiological recordings, calcium imaging and mRNA analysis.

  "description": "From the Kohn-Sham band gap to the fundamental gap in solids. An integer electron approachIt is often stated that the Kohn-Sham occupied-unoccupied gap in both molecules and solids is \"wrong\". We argue that this is not a correct statement. The KS theory does not allow to interpret the exact KS HOMO-LUMO gap as the fundamental gap (difference (I - A) of electron affinity (A) and ionization energy (I), twice the chemical hardness), from which it indeed differs, strongly in molecules and moderately in solids. The exact Kohn-Sham HOMO-LUMO gap in molecules is much below the fundamental gap and very close to the much smaller optical gap (first excitation energy), and LDA/GGA yield very similar gaps. In solids the situation is different: the excitation energy to delocalized excited states and the fundamental gap (I - A) are very similar, not so disparate as in molecules. Again the Kohn-Sham and LDA/GGA band gaps do not represent (I - A) but are significantly smaller. However, the special properties of an extended system like a solid make it very easy to calculate the fundamental gap from the ground state (neutral system) band structure calculations entirely within a density functional framework. The correction \u0394 from the KS gap to the fundamental gap originates from the response part vresp of the exchange-correlation potential and can be calculated very simply using an approximation to vresp. This affords a calculation of the fundamental gap at the same level of accuracy as other properties of crystals at little extra cost beyond the ground state bandstructure calculation. The method is based on integer electron systems, fractional electron systems (an ensemble of N- and (N + 1)-electron systems) and the derivative discontinuity are not invoked."

The treatment of type 2 diabetes requires positive modulation of GLP-1R to inhibit glucagon secretion and stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Here we report crystal structures of the human GLP-1R transmembrane domain in complex with two different negative allosteric modulators, PF-06372222 and NNC0640, at 2.7 and 3.0\u2009\u00c5 resolution, respectively. The structures reveal a common binding pocket for negative allosteric modulators, present in both GLP-1R and GCGR and located outside helices V-VII near the intracellular half of the receptor. The receptor is in an inactive conformation with compounds that restrict movement of the intracellular tip of helix VI, a movement that is generally associated with activation mechanisms in class A GPCRs. Molecular modelling and mutagenesis studies indicate that agonist positive allosteric modulators target the same general region, but in a distinct sub-pocket at the interface between helices V and VI, which may facilitate the formation of an intracellular binding site that enhances G-protein coupling."

The two domains are connected by a 12-residue segment termed the stalk, which adopts a \u03b2-strand conformation, instead of forming an \u03b1-helix as observed in the previously solved structure of the GCGR transmembrane domain. The first extracellular loop exhibits a \u03b2-hairpin conformation and interacts with the stalk to form a compact \u03b2-sheet structure. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange, disulfide crosslinking and molecular dynamics studies suggest that the stalk and the first extracellular loop have critical roles in modulating peptide ligand binding and receptor activation.

It was aimed to (a) deduce characteristic contamination patterns for both PCBs and PAHs and (b) provide the first comprehensive dataset for establishment of source characterisation of PCBs and PAHs. This is in line with new South African legislation on mandatory monitoring of PCB and PAH emissions. Bar charts, principal component analysis (PCA) and biplots were utilised to identify signature contamination patterns and distribution of PCBs and PAHs within the Jukskei and Klip Rivers. Sediments from the Jukskei and Klip River catchments both showed distinct contamination signatures for hexa to nonachlorinated PCBs, characteristic of contamination by Aroclor 1254 and 1260 technical mixtures. PCB signature patterns in order of abundance were 138>180>206>153>187>149 and 138>153>180>149>187>110>170 for the Jukskei and Klip River sediments, respectively. The upstream Alberton point had the highest \u03a331 PCB and \u03a3 (parent+alkyl) PAH concentrations in the Klip River of 61 and 6000\u03bcgkg\u22121 dry weight (dw), respectively. In the Jukskei River, the upstream Marlboro point had the highest \u03a331 PCB concentration of 19\u03bcgkg\u22121 dw and the N14 site recorded the highest \u03a3 (parent+alkyl) PAH concentration of 2750\u03bcgkg\u22121 dw. PAH concentrations in both the Jukskei and Klip Rivers were significantly higher than the PCB concentrations. Fluoranthene, phenanthrene and pyrene were found in the highest concentrations in both the Jukskei and Klip River sediments. Both the Jukskei and Klip River sediments showed trends of a mixed pyrogenic-petrogenic PAH source contamination."

  "description": "Learning to read and write in evolution: From static pseudoenzymes and pseudosignalers to dynamic gear shiftersWe present a systems biology view on pseudoenzymes that acknowledges that genes are not selfish: the genome is. With network function as the selectable unit, there has been an evolutionary bonus for recombination of functions of and within proteins. Many proteins house a functionality by which they 'read' the cell's state, and one by which they 'write' and thereby change that state. Should the writer domain lose its cognate function, a 'pseudoenzyme' or 'pseudosignaler' arises. GlnK involved in Escherichia coli ammonia assimilation may well be a pseudosignaler, associating 'reading' the nitrogen state of the cell to 'writing' the ammonium uptake activity. We identify functional pseudosignalers in the cyclin-dependent kinase complexes regulating cell-cycle progression. For the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, we illustrate how a 'dead' pseudosignaler could produce potentially selectable functionalities. Four billion years ago, bioenergetics may have shuffled 'electron-writers', producing various networks that all served the same function of anaerobic ATP synthesis and carbon assimilation from hydrogen and carbon dioxide, but at different ATP/acetate ratios. This would have enabled organisms to deal with variable challenges of energy need and substrate supply. The same principle might enable 'gear-shifting' in real time, by dynamically generating different pseudo-redox enzymes, reshuffling their coenzymes, and rerouting network fluxes. Non-stationary pH gradients in thermal vents together with similar such shuffling mechanisms may have produced a first selectable proton-motivated pyrophosphate synthase and subsequent ATP synthase. A combination of functionalities into enzymes, signalers, and the pseudoversions thereof may offer fitness in terms of plasticity, both in real time and in evolution."

  "description": "A Tonoplast P3B-ATPase Mediates Fusion of Two Types of Vacuoles in Petal CellsIt is known that plant cells can contain multiple distinct vacuoles; however, the abundance of multivacuolar cells and the mechanisms underlying vacuolar differentiation and communication among different types of vacuoles remain unknown. PH1 and PH5 are tonoplast P-ATPases that form a heteromeric pump that hyper-acidifies the central vacuole (CV) of epidermal cells in petunia petals. Here, we show that the sorting of this pump and other vacuolar proteins to the CV involves transit through small vacuoles: vacuolinos. Vacuolino formation is controlled by transcription factors regulating pigment synthesis and transcription of PH1 and PH5. Trafficking of proteins from vacuolinos to the central vacuole is impaired by misexpression of vacuolar SNAREs as well as mutants for the PH1 component of the PH1-PH5 pump. The finding that PH1-PH5 and these SNAREs interact strongly suggests that structural tonoplast proteins can act as tethering factors in the recognition of different vacuolar types."

  "description": "Structural Analysis of Chemokine Receptor-Ligand InteractionsThis review focuses on the construction and application of structural chemokine receptor models for the elucidation of molecular determinants of chemokine receptor modulation and the structure-based discovery and design of chemokine receptor ligands. A comparative analysis of ligand binding pockets in chemokine receptors is presented, including a detailed description of the CXCR4, CCR2, CCR5, CCR9, and US28 X-ray structures, and their implication for modeling molecular interactions of chemokine receptors with small-molecule ligands, peptide ligands, and large antibodies and chemokines. These studies demonstrate how the integration of new structural information on chemokine receptors with extensive structure-activity relationship and site-directed mutagenesis data facilitates the prediction of the structure of chemokine receptor-ligand complexes that have not been crystallized. Finally, a review of structure-based ligand discovery and design studies based on chemokine receptor crystal structures and homology models illustrates the possibilities and challenges to find novel ligands for chemokine receptors."

  "description": "Adduct-ion formation in trapped ion mobility spectrometry as a potential tool for studying molecular structures and conformationsRecent developments in the field of ion mobility spectrometry provide new possibilities to explore and understand gas-phase ion chemistry. In this study, hyphenated trapped ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (TIMS-MS) was applied to investigate analyte ion mobility as function of adduct ion formation for twelve pharmaceutically relevant molecules, and for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its isomer cannabidiol (CBD). Samples were introduced by direct infusion and ions were generated with positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) observing protonated and sodiated ions. Measurements were performed with and without addition of cesium-, lithium-, silver- and sodium ions to the samples. For the tested compounds, metal adduct ions with the same m/z but with different mobility and collision cross section (CCSs) were observed, indicating different molecular conformations. Formation of analyte dimers was also observed, which could be associated with molecular geometry of the compounds. By optimizing the range and speed of the electric field gradient and ramp, respectively, the separation of THC and CBD was achieved by employing the adduct formation. This study demonstrates that the favorable resolution of TIMS combined with the ability to detect weakly bound counter ions is a valuable means for rapid detection, separation and structural assignment of molecular isomers and analyte conformations."

  "description": "A review of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in the indoor environment occurrence in consumer products, indoor air and dustAs many people spend a large part of their life indoors, the quality of the indoor environment is important. Data on contaminants such as flame retardants, pesticides and plasticizers are available for indoor air and dust but are scarce for consumer products such as computers, televisions, furniture, carpets, etc. This review presents information on semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in consumer products in an attempt to link the information available for chemicals in indoor air and dust with their indoor sources. A number of 256 papers were selected and divided among SVOCs found in consumer products (n = 57), indoor dust (n = 104) and air (n = 95). Concentrations of SVOCs in consumer products, indoor dust and air are reported (e.g. PFASs max: 13.9 \u03bcg/g in textiles, 5.8 \u03bcg/kg in building materials, 121 ng/g in house dust and 6.4 ng/m3 in indoor air). Most of the studies show common aims, such as human exposure and risk assessment. The main micro-environments investigated (houses, offices and schools) reflect the relevance of indoor air quality. Most of the studies show a lack of data on concentrations of chemicals in consumer goods and often only the presence of chemicals is reported. At the moment this is the largest obstacle linking chemicals in products to chemicals detected in indoor air and dust."

  "description": "Bond-breaking excitations with diverging coupling matrix of response density functional theory from highest-level functionalsBond-breaking excitations \u03c9\u03b1 are the problematic case of adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The calculated \u03c9\u03b1 erroneously vanishes with the bond elongation, since the Hartree-exchange-correlation kernel and the corresponding response coupling matrix K of standard approximations lack the characteristic divergence in the dissociation limit. In this paper an approximation for K is proposed constructed from the highest-level functionals, in which both occupied and virtual Kohn-Sham orbitals participate with the weights wp. The latter provide the correct divergence of K in the limit of dissociating two-electron bond. The present K brings a decisive contribution to the energy of the 1\u03a3u + in the prototype H2 molecule calculated for various H-H separations. At shorter separations it improves \u03c9\u03b1 compared to the zero-order TDDFT estimate, while at the largest separation it reproduces near-saturation of the reference excitation energy."

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of atrazine on the survival, growth and gonad development of African clawed frogs. After exposure of tadpoles to atrazine concentrations of 0 (control), 0.01, 200 and 500 \u03bcg L\u22121 in water, mortality rates of 0, 0, 3.3 and 70% respectively were recorded for the 90 day exposure period. Morphometry showed significantly reduced tadpole mass in the 500 \u03bcg L\u22121 atrazine exposed tadpoles (p < 0.05). Light microscopy on testes of adult frogs exposed to the same atrazine concentrations using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Van Gieson staining techniques revealed gonadal atrophy, disruption of germ cell lines, seminiferous tubule structure damage and formation of extensive connective tissue around seminiferous tubules of frogs exposed to 200 \u03bcg L\u22121 and 500 \u03bcg L\u22121 atrazine concentrations. Ultrastructural analysis of the cellular organelles using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed significant amounts of damaged mitochondria in testosterone producing Leydig cells as well as Sertoli cells. Biochemical analysis revealed reduced serum testosterone levels in adult frogs at all exposure levels as well as presence of six atrazine metabolites in frog serum and liver. The results indicate that atrazine concentrations greater than the calculated LC50 of 343.7 \u03bcg L\u22121 cause significant mortality in tadpoles, while concentrations \u2265200 \u03bcg L\u22121 adversely affect reproductive health of adult frogs and development of tadpoles sub-chronically exposed to atrazine."

  "description": "Hydrogen peroxide production by lactobacilli promotes epithelial restitution during colitisInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by cycles of acute flares, recovery and remission phases. Treatments for accelerating tissue restitution and prolonging remission are scarce, but altering the microbiota composition to promote intestinal homeostasis is considered a safe, economic and promising approach. Although probiotic bacteria have not yet fulfilled fully their promise in clinical trials, understanding the mechanism of how they exert beneficial effects will permit devising improved therapeutic strategies. Here we probe if one of the defining features of lactobacilli, the ability to generate nanomolar H2O2, contributes to their beneficial role in colitis. H2O2 generation by wild type L. johnsonii was modified by either deleting or overexpressing the enzymatic H2O2 source(s) followed by orally administering the bacteria before and during DSS colitis. Boosting luminal H2O2 concentrations within a physiological range accelerated recovery from colitis, while significantly exceeding this H2O2 level triggered bacteraemia. This study supports a role for increasing H2O2 within the physiological range at the epithelial barrier, independently of the enzymatic source and/or delivery mechanism, for inducing recovery and remission in IBD."

  "description": "Imaging linear and circular polarization features in leaves with complete Mueller matrix polarimetrySpectropolarimetry of intact plant leaves allows to probe the molecular architecture of vegetation photosynthesis in a non-invasive and non-destructive way and, as such, can offer a wealth of physiological information. In addition to the molecular signals due to the photosynthetic machinery, the cell structure and its arrangement within a leaf can create and modify polarization signals. Using Mueller matrix polarimetry with rotating retarder modulation, we have visualized spatial variations in polarization in transmission around the chlorophyll a absorbance band from 650 nm to 710 nm. We show linear and circular polarization measurements of maple leaves and cultivated maize leaves and discuss the corresponding Mueller matrices and the Mueller matrix decompositions, which show distinct features in diattenuation, polarizance, retardance and depolarization. Importantly, while normal leaf tissue shows a typical split signal with both a negative and a positive peak in the induced fractional circular polarization and circular dichroism, the signals close to the veins only display a negative band. The results are similar to the negative band as reported earlier for single macrodomains. We discuss the possible role of the chloroplast orientation around the veins as a cause of this phenomenon. Systematic artefacts are ruled out as three independent measurements by different instruments gave similar results. These results provide better insight into circular polarization measurements on whole leaves and options for vegetation remote sensing using circular polarization."

  "description": "Prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals and risk of being born small for gestational age: Pooled analysis of seven European birth cohortsBackground and aims: There is evidence that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have developmental effects at environmental concentrations. We investigated whether some EDCs are associated with the adverse birth outcome Small for Gestational Age (SGA). Methods: We used PCB 153, p,p\u2019-DDE, HCB, PFOS and PFOA measured in maternal, cord blood or breast milk samples of 5446 mother-child pairs (subset of 693 for the perfluorinated compounds) from seven European birth cohorts (1997\u20132012). SGA infants were those with birth weight below the 10th percentile for the norms defined by gestational age, country and infant's sex. We modelled the association between measured or estimated cord serum EDC concentrations and SGA using multiple logistic regression analyses. We explored effect modification by child's sex and maternal smoking during pregnancy. Results: Among the 5446 newborns, 570 (10.5%) were SGA. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in PCB 153 was associated with a modestly increased risk of SGA (odds ratio (OR) of 1.05 [95% CI: 1.04\u20131.07]) that was stronger in girls (OR of 1.09 [95% CI: 1.04\u20131.14]) than in boys (OR of 1.03 [95% CI: 1.03\u20131.04]) (p-interaction = 0.025). For HCB, we found a modestly increased odds of SGA in girls (OR of 1.04 [95% CI: 1.01\u20131.07] per IQR increase), and an inverse association in boys (OR of 0.90 [95% CI: 0.85\u20130.95]) (p-interaction = 0.0003). Assessment of the HCB-sex-smoking interaction suggested that the increased odds of SGA associated with HCB exposure was only in girls of smoking mothers (OR of 1.18 [95% CI: 1.11\u20131.25]) (p-interaction = 0.055). Higher concentrations of PFOA were associated with greater risk of SGA (OR of 1.64 [95% CI: 0.97\u20132.76]). Elevated PFOS levels were associated with increased odds of SGA in newborns of mothers who smoked during pregnancy (OR of 1.63 [95% CI: 1.02\u20132.59]), while an inverse association was found in those of non-smoking mothers (OR of 0.66 [95% CI: 0.61\u20130.72]) (p-interaction = 0.0004). No significant associations were found for p,p\u2019-DDE. Conclusions: Prenatal environmental exposure to organochlorine and perfluorinated compounds with endocrine disrupting properties may contribute to the prevalence of SGA. We found indication of effect modification by child's sex and smoking during pregnancy. The direction of the associations differed by chemical and these effect modifiers, suggesting diverse mechanisms of action and biological pathways."

In two studies in schoolchildren in Cuba (N = 1389) and in Cambodia (N = 2471), STH infections and calprotectin concentrations were measured in stool samples and acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) were measured in blood. Associations between STH infections and elevated concentrations of CRP, AGP and calprotectin were estimated using multiple logistic regression. The prevalence of elevated CRP concentration (\u22655 mg/L) was 5.4% in both populations. Elevated AGP (\u22651 g/L) was found in 39.5% of the Cambodian children and 11.3% of the Cuban children. Fecal calprotectin was elevated (\u226550 mg/kg) in 9.4% of the Cambodian children and 3.7% of the Cuban children. STH infections in Cuba were mainly due to Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, with prevalences of 5.2% and 3.2%, respectively. In Cambodia, hookworm was the most prevalent species (16.3%). We found no significant associations between elevated concentrations of either acute phase proteins or fecal calprotectin and STH infections. We observed a trend towards an inverse association between elevated CRP and STH infections in both studies. STH infections are not associated with either local intestinal or systemic inflammation. The trend towards less elevated CRP concentration in STH infections may indicate a reduced risk of metabolic inflammatory diseases, which merits further investigation."

The steric rigidity required in such systems demands the presence of two naphthyl or benzo[b]thiophene groups. The synthetic approach to the expanded spirosilanes extends Takai\u2019s method (Kuninobu et al. in Angew Chem Int Ed 52(5):1520\u20131522, 2013) for the synthesis of spirosilabifluorenes in which both a Si\u2013H and a C\u2013H bond of a dihydrosilane are activated by a rhodium catalyst. The expanded dihydrosilanes were obtained from halogenated aromatic precursors. Their asymmetric cyclization to the spirosilanes were conducted with [Rh(cod)Cl]2 in the presence of the chiral bidentate phosphane ligands (R)-BINAP, (R)-MeO-BIPHEP, and (R)-SEGPHOS, including derivatives with P-(3,5-t-Bu-4-MeO)-phenyl (DTBM) groups.

  "description": "Towards automation of glycomic profiling of complex biological materialsGlycosylation is considered one of the most complex and structurally diverse post-translational modifications of proteins. Glycans play important roles in many biological processes such as protein folding, regulation of protein stability, solubility and serum half-life. One of the ways to study glycosylation is systematic structural characterizations of protein glycosylation utilizing glycomics methodology based around mass spectrometry (MS). The most prevalent bottleneck stages for glycomic analyses is laborious sample preparation steps. Therefore, in this study, we aim to improve sample preparations by automation. We recently demonstrated the successful application of an automated high-throughput (HT), glycan permethylation protocol based on 96-well microplates, in the analysis of purified glycoproteins. Therefore, we wanted to test if these developed HT methodologies could be applied to more complex biological starting materials. Our automated 96-well-plate based permethylation method showed very comparable results with established glycomic methodology. Very similar glycomic profiles were obtained for complex glycoprotein/protein mixtures derived from heterogeneous mouse tissues. Automated N-glycan release, enrichment and automated permethylation of samples proved to be convenient, robust and reliable. Therefore we conclude that these automated procedures are a step forward towards the development of a fully automated, fast and reliable glycomic profiling system for analysis of complex biological materials."

  "description": "MIR137 schizophrenia-associated locus controls synaptic function by regulating synaptogenesis, synapse maturation and synaptic transmissionThe MIR137 locus is a replicated genetic risk factor for schizophrenia. The risk-associated allele is reported to increase miR- 137 expression and miR-137 overexpression alters synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampus. We investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying these observed effects in mouse hippocampal neurons in culture. First, we correlated the risk allele to expression of the genes in the MIR137 locus in human postmortem brain. Some evidence for increased MIR137HG expression was observed, especially in hippocampus of the disease-associated genotype. Second, in mouse hippocampal neurons, we confirmed previously observed changes in synaptic transmission upon miR-137 overexpression. Evoked synaptic transmission and spontaneous release were 50% reduced. We identified defects in release probability as the underlying cause. In contrast to previous observations, no evidence was obtained for selective synaptic vesicle docking defects. Instead, ultrastructural morphometry revealed multiple effects of miR-137 overexpression on docking, active zone length and total vesicle number. Moreover, proteomic analyses of neuronal protein showed that expression of Syt1 and Cplx1, previously reported as downregulated upon miR-137 overexpression, was unaltered. Immunocytochemistry of synapses overexpressing miR-137 showed normal Synaptotagmin1 and Complexin1 protein levels. Instead, our proteomic analyses revealed altered expression of genes involved in synaptogenesis. Concomitantly, synaptogenesis assays revealed 31% reduction in synapse formation. Taken together, these data show that miR-137 regulates synaptic function by regulating synaptogenesis, synaptic ultrastructure and synapse function. These effects are plausible contributors to the increased schizophrenia risk associated with miR-137 overexpression."

  "description": "Targeting \u03b2-catenin dependent Wnt signaling via peptidomimetic inhibitors in murine chondrocytes and OA cartilageObjective: The canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in regulating chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation during Osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to test the therapeutic potential of two stapled peptide canonical Wnt inhibitors \u2013 SAH-Bcl9 and StAx-35R \u2013 in preventing Wnt induced cartilage changes in OA. Methods: Primary neonatal murine chondrocytes and cartilage explants from OA patients undergoing total joint replacement for knee OA, were used for microscopy to determine matrix and cell penetrating capacity of fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC-tagged SAH-Bcl9 and StAx-35R peptides. T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCF/LEF) reporter assays were used to monitor the inhibition of Wnt3a induced \u03b2-catenin signaling by each peptide. Changes in chondrocyte phenotypic marker gene expression were analyzed by qRT PCR. Results: Both peptides localized intercellular in primary murine chondrocytes and cartilage explants. They inhibited Wnt3a induced TCF/LEF promoter activity in primary murine chondrocytes. Both inhibitors did not rescue Wnt3a altered expression of chondrocyte phenotypic genes (Sox9, Col2a1, Acan) and hypertrophy marker gene (Col10a1) at high doses (100 ng/ml). Upon application of 10 ng/ml Wnt3a, StAx-35R partially reversed the Wnt effect on Sox9 and Col2a1 gene expression. Both peptides, however, reversed the downregulation of SOX9 and aggrecan (ACAN), and decrease of COL10A1 gene expression in preserved human OA cartilage explants. Conclusion: These data indicate that blockade of canonical Wnt signaling might be a therapeutic strategy to treat early OA cases and protect further cartilage degradation by preventing chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation."

  "description": "Capillary HILIC-MS: A New Tool for Sensitive Top-Down ProteomicsRecent progress in top-down proteomics has driven the demand for chromatographic methods compatible with mass spectrometry (MS) that can separate intact proteins. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) has recently shown good potential for the characterization of glycoforms of intact proteins. In the present study, we demonstrate that HILIC can separate a wide range of proteins exhibiting orthogonal selectivity with respect to reversed-phase LC (RPLC). However, the application of HILIC to the analysis of low abundance proteins (e.g., in proteomics analysis) is hampered by low volume loadability, hindering down-scaling of the method to column diameters below 2.1 mm. Moreover, HILIC-MS sensitivity is decreased due to ion suppression from the trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) often used as the ion-pair agent to improve the selectivity and efficiency in the analysis of glycoproteins. Here, we introduce a capillary-based HILIC-MS method that overcomes these problems. Our method uses RPLC trap-columns to load and inject the sample, circumventing issues of protein solubility and volume loadability in capillary columns (200 \u03bcm ID). The low flow rates and use of a dopant gas in the electrospray interface improve protein-ionization efficiencies and reduce suppression by TFA. Overall, this allows the separation and detection of small protein quantities (down to 5 ng injected on column) as indicated by the analysis of a mixture of model proteins. The potential of the new capillary HILIC-MS is demonstrated by the analysis of a complex cell lysate."

  "description": "Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2): Dependence on Nucleophile, Leaving Group, Central Atom, Substituents, and SolventThe reaction potential energy surface (PES), and thus the mechanism of bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2), depends profoundly on the nature of the nucleophile and leaving group, but also on the central, electrophilic atom, its substituents, as well as on the medium in which the reaction takes place. Here, we provide an overview of recent studies and demonstrate how changes in any one of the aforementioned factors affect the SN2 mechanism. One of the most striking effects is the transition from a double-well to a single-well PES when the central atom is changed from a second-period (e. g. carbon) to a higher-period element (e.g, silicon, germanium). Variations in nucleophilicity, leaving group ability, and bulky substituents around a second-row element central atom can then be exploited to change the single-well PES back into a double-well. Reversely, these variations can also be used to produce a single-well PES for second-period elements, for example, a stable pentavalent carbon species."

  "description": "Salinity tolerance of two potato cultivars (Solanum tuberosum) correlates with differences in vacuolar transport activityPotato is an important cultivated crop species and since it is moderately salt sensitive there is a need to develop more salt tolerant cultivars. A high activity of Na+ transport across the tonoplast in exchange for H+ is essential to reduce Na+ toxicity. The proton motive force (PMF) generated by the V-H+-ATPase and the V-H+-PPase energizes the Na+ (K+)/H+ antiport. We compared the activity, gene expression, and protein levels of the vacuolar proton pumps and the Na+ /H+ antiporters in two potato cultivars (Solanum tuberosum) contrasting in their salt tolerance (cv. Desiree; tolerant and Mozart; sensitive) grown at 0 and 60 mM NaCl. Tonoplast-enriched vesicles were used to study the pump activity and protein levels of the V-H+-ATPase and the V-H+-PPase and the activity of the Na+ /H+ antiporter. Although salt stress reduced the V-H+-ATPase and the V-H+-PPase activity in both cultivars, the decline in H+ pump activity was more severe in the salt-sensitive cultivar Mozart. After salt treatment, protein amounts of the vacuolar H+ pumps decreased in Mozart but remained unchanged in the cultivar Desiree. Decreased protein amounts of the V-H+-PPase found in Mozart may explain the reduced V-H+-PPase activity found for Mozart after salt stress. Under non-stress conditions, protein amounts of V-H+-PPase were equal in both cultivars while the V-H+-PPase activity was already twice as high and remained higher after salt treatment in the cultivar Desiree as compared to Mozart. This cultivar-dependent V-H+-PPase activity may explain the higher salt tolerance of Desiree. Moreover, combined with reduced vacuolar H+ pump activity, Mozart showed a lower Na+ /H+ exchange activity and the Km for Na+ is at least twofold lower in tonoplast vesicles from Desiree, what suggests that NHXs from Desiree have a higher affinity for Na+ as compared to Mozart. From these results, we conclude that the higher capacity in combination with the higher affinity for Na+ uptake can be an important factor to explain the differences in salt tolerance of these two potato cultivars."

We show that size consistency in the AC-based functionals can be restored in a very simple way at no extra computational cost. Results on a large set of benchmark molecular interaction energies show that functionals based on the interaction strength interpolation approximations are significantly more accurate than second-order perturbation theory."

Seasonal sampling was conducted in the Hartbeespoort Lake using sub-surface grab sampling to determine the lake's ecological status and obtain data for establishment of progressive operational monitoring. The Jukskei River, which lies upstream of the Hartbeespoort Dam, was sampled in the winter season. Five year old carp (Cyprinus carpio) and catfish (Clarias gariepinus) were also sampled from the Hartbeespoort Dam to study bioaccumulation in biota as well as to estimate risk associated with fish consumption. In the Jukskei River, the main source of 11 emerging pollutants (EPs) was identified as raw sewage overflow, with the highest \u221111 EP concentration of 593 ng L\u22121 being recorded at the Midrand point and the lowest \u221111 EP concentration of 164 ng L\u22121 at the N14 site located 1 km downstream of a large wastewater treatment plant. The Jukskei River was found to be the largest contributor of the emerging contaminants detected in the Hartbeespoort Dam. In the Hartbeespoort Dam EP concentrations were generally in the order efavirenz > nevirapine > carbamazepine > methocarbamol > bromacil > venlafaxine. Water and sediment were sampled from the uMngeni River estuary within 24 h after large volumes of an assortment of pharmaceutical waste had been discovered to be washed into the river estuary after flash rainfall on 18 May 2016. Analytical results revealed high levels of some emerging pollutants in sediment samples, up to 81 ng g\u22121 for nevirapine and 4 ng g\u22121 for etilefrine HCL. This study shows that efavirenz, nevirapine, carbamazepine, methocarbamol, bromacil and venlafaxine are contaminants that require operational monitoring in South African urban waters."

  "description": "Neurotoxicity fingerprinting of venoms using on-line microfluidic AChBP profilingVenoms from snakes are rich sources of highly active proteins with potent affinity towards a variety of enzymes and receptors. Of the many distinct toxicities caused by envenomation, neurotoxicity plays an important role in the paralysis of prey by snakes as well as by venomous sea snails and insects. In order to improve the analytical discovery component of venom toxicity profiling, this paper describes the implementation of microfluidic high-resolution screening (HRS) to obtain neurotoxicity fingerprints from venoms that facilitates identification of the neurotoxic components of envenomation. To demonstrate this workflow, 47 snake venoms were profiled using the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) to mimic the target of neurotoxic proteins, in particular nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In the microfluidic HRS system, nanoliquid chromatographic (nanoLC) separations were on-line connected to both AChBP profiling and parallel mass spectrometry (MS). For virtually all neurotoxic elapid snake venoms tested, we obtained bioactivity fingerprints showing major and minor bioactive zones containing masses consistent with three-finger toxins (3FTxs), whereas, viperid and colubrid venoms showed little or no detectable bioactivity. Our findings demonstrate that venom interactions with AChBP correlate with the severity of neurotoxicity observed following human envenoming by different snake species. We further, as proof of principle, characterized bioactive venom peptides from a viperid (Daboia russelli) and an elapid (Aspidelaps scutatus scutatus) snake by nanoLC-MS/MS, revealing that different toxin classes interact with the AChBP, and that this binding correlates with the inhibition of \u03b17-nAChR in calcium-flux cell-based assays. The on-line post-column binding assay and subsequent toxin characterization methodologies described here provide a new in vitro analytic platform for rapidly investigating neurotoxic snake venom proteins."

  "description": "Dynamic elementary mode modelling of non-steady state flux dataBackground: A novel framework is proposed to analyse metabolic fluxes in non-steady state conditions, based on the new concept of dynamic elementary mode (dynEM): an elementary mode activated partially depending on the time point of the experiment. Results: Two methods are introduced here: dynamic elementary mode analysis (dynEMA) and dynamic elementary mode regression discriminant analysis (dynEMR-DA). The former is an extension of the recently proposed principal elementary mode analysis (PEMA) method from steady state to non-steady state scenarios. The latter is a discriminant model that permits to identify which dynEMs behave strongly different depending on the experimental conditions. Two case studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with fluxes derived from simulated and real concentration data sets, are presented to highlight the benefits of this dynamic modelling. Conclusions: This methodology permits to analyse metabolic fluxes at early stages with the aim of i) creating reduced dynamic models of flux data, ii) combining many experiments in a single biologically meaningful model, and iii) identifying the metabolic pathways that drive the organism from one state to another when changing the environmental conditions."

  "description": "RD5-mediated lack of PE_PGRS and PPE-MPTR export in BCG vaccine strains results in strong reduction of antigenic repertoire but little impact on protectionTuberculosis is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide. Although the BCG vaccine is widely used, it does not efficiently protect against pulmonary tuberculosis and an improved tuberculosis vaccine is therefore urgently needed. Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses different ESX/Type VII secretion (T7S) systems to transport proteins important for virulence and host immune responses. We recently reported that secretion of T7S substrates belonging to the mycobacteria-specific Pro-Glu (PE) and Pro-Pro-Glu (PPE) proteins of the PGRS (polymorphic GC-rich sequences) and MPTR (major polymorphic tandem repeat) subfamilies required both a functional ESX-5 system and a functional PPE38/71 protein for secretion. Inactivation of ppe38/71 and the resulting loss of PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR secretion were linked to increased virulence of M. tuberculosis strains. Here, we show that a predicted total of 89 PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR surface proteins are not exported by certain animal-adapted strains of the M. tuberculosis complex including M. bovis. This \u0394ppe38/71-associated secretion defect therefore also occurs in the M. bovis-derived tuberculosis vaccine BCG and could be partially restored by introduction of the M. tuberculosis ppe38-locus. Epitope mapping of the PPE-MPTR protein PPE10, further allowed us to monitor T-cell responses in splenocytes from BCG/M. tuberculosis immunized mice, confirming the dependence of PPE10-specific immune-induction on ESX-5/PPE38-mediated secretion. Restoration of PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR secretion in recombinant BCG neither altered global antigenic presentation or activation of innate immune cells, nor protective efficacy in two different mouse vaccination-infection models. This unexpected finding stimulates a reassessment of the immunomodulatory properties of PE_PGRS/PPE-MPTR proteins, some of which are contained in vaccine formulations currently in clinical evaluation."

  "description": "The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML): Language Specification for Level 3 Version 2 CoreComputational models can help researchers to interpret data, understand biological functions, and make quantitative predictions. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a file format for representing computational models in a declarative form that different software systems can exchange. SBML is oriented towards describing biological processes of the sort common in research on a number of topics, including metabolic pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others. By supporting SBML as an input/output format, different tools can all operate on an identical representation of a model, removing opportunities for translation errors and assuring a common starting point for analyses and simulations. This document provides the specification for Version 2 of SBML Level 3 Core. The specification defines the data structures prescribed by SBML, their encoding in XML (the eXtensible Markup Language), validation rules that determine the validity of an SBML document, and examples of models in SBML form. The design of Version 2 differs from Version 1 principally in allowing new MathML constructs, making more child elements optional, and adding identifiers to all SBML elements instead of only selected elements. Other materials and software are available from the SBML project website at http://sbml.org/."

  "description": "Child development, growth and microbiota: follow-up of a randomized education trial in UgandaBackground: Undernutrition impairs child development outcomes and growth. In this follow-up study of an open cluster-randomized intervention trial we examined the effects of an education package delivered to mothers in rural Uganda on their children's development, growth and gut microbiota at 36 months of age.Methods: The parental trial included 511 mother-child pairs recruited when the children were 6-8 months. In that trial, a nutrition, stimulation and hygiene education was delivered to mothers in the intervention group while the control group received routine health care. A follow-up sample of 155 pairs (intervention n\u2009=\u200977, control n\u2009=\u200978) were re-enrolled when the children were 24 months. Developmental outcomes were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) composite scores for cognitive (primary endpoint), language and motor development. Development outcomes were also evaluated using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). Other outcomes included growth and gut microbiota composition.Results: The demographic characteristics were not different (P\u2009>\u20090.05) between the intervention and control groups and similar to those of the parental study. The intervention group had higher BSID-III scores than controls, with mean difference 10.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.31-17.05, P\u2009=\u20090.002); 7.59 (1.62-13.66, P\u2009=\u20090.01); 9.00 (2.92-15.40, P\u2009=\u20090.005), for cognitive, language and motor composite scores, respectively. An improvement in the intervention compared to the control group was obtained for both the ASQ and the MSEL scores. The mean difference in height-for-age z-score was higher in the intervention compared to the control group: 0.50 (0.25-0.75, P\u2009=\u20090.0001). Gut microbiota composition did not differ significantly between the two study groups.Conclusions: The maternal education intervention had positive effects on child development and growth at three years, but did not alter gut microbiota composition. This intervention may be applicable in other low-resource settings.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov registration number NCT02098031."

  "description": "Imatinib mesylate does not counteract ovarian tissue fibrosis in postnatal rat ovaryChemotherapy may result in ovarian atrophy, a depletion of the primordial follicle pool, diminished ovarian weight, cortical and stromal fibrosis. Imatinib mesylate is an anticancer agent that inhibits competitively several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RTKs play important roles in cell metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis. In clinic, imatinib mesylate is also known as an anti-fibrotic medicine. In the present study, the impact of imatinib on the ovarian tissue was investigated by assessing ovarian tissue fibrosis in postnatal rat administered with or without imatinib for three days. Fibrosis in the ovarian tissue was determined by histology (Picrosirius and Masson's trichrome staining) and the protein expression of vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Furthermore, mRNA expression of Forkhead box transcription factor O1 and O3 (FOXO1 and FOXO3), which are markers of cell proliferation was quantified. A short-term exposure to imatinib showed to increase tissue fibrosis in ovaries. This was observed by Masson's trichrome staining. Exposure to imatinib led also to a down-regulation of vimentin protein expression and up-regulation mRNA expression of FOXO3. This may indicate a role of FOXO3 in ovarian tissue fibrosis in postnatal rat ovaries."

OMV-induced DC maturation was dependent on the presence of LPS and the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) adapter protein downstream of toll-like receptor signaling. Importantly, OMVs did not induce pyroptosis/cell death, but instead provided a significant survival benefit in DCs over non-stimulated DCs. OMVs displaying a sizeable ovalbumin fragment at the vesicle surface induce potent cross-presentation in BMDCs and splenic CD11c                             +                              DCs to OTI CD8                             +                              T cells, dependent on MyD88.

Hence, an OMV-specific programming of DCs that induces maturation and provides a survival benefit for antigen presentation to T cells is identified. Additionally, for the first time, antigen-specific and potent cross-presentation of antigen-loaded OMVs to CD8                             +                              T cells is demonstrated. These data provide mechanistical insight into the processes needed for the DC-mediated cross-presentation of OMV-derived antigens to CD8                             +                              T cells with implications for therapeutic strategies. Statement of Significance: Bacteria are primarily known to cause disease. However, recent research has focused on using engineered bacteria and its byproducts as vaccine agents. In particular, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) have shown promise in eliciting potent immunity against a variety of pathogens. While most vaccines rely on the generation of antibodies, the control of viral replication and tumor growth is driven by cytotoxic CD8                             +                              T cells induced by dendritic cells (DCs). As such, there is a dire need for vaccines that use DCs to elicit CD8                             +                              T cell responses. Studying OMVs as engineered biomaterial and its interaction with DCs allows tailored induction of immunity. This study includes important findings on OMV-dendritic cell interactions and for the first time supports OMVs as vehicles for the induction of antigen-specific CD8                             +                              T cell responses. Additionally, important mechanistical insight into the molecular pathways needed for the cross-presentation of OMV-derived antigens to CD8                             +                              T cells is provided.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of IL-2, IL-17, and INF-\u03b3 in-house enzyme-linked immunospot assays using a Mycobacterium avium lysate, in order to identify a noninvasive diagnostic method of nontuberculous mycobacteria infection. Children with subacute and chronic lymphadenopathies or with a previous diagnosis of nontuberculous mycobacteria lymphadenitis were prospectively enrolled in the study. Sixty children with lymphadenitis were included in our study: 16 with confirmed infection (group 1), 30 probable infected (group 2) and 14 uninfected (group 3). Significantly higher median cytokine values were found in group 1 vs group 2, in group 1 vs group 3, and in group 2 vs group 3 considering IL-2-based enzyme-linked immunospot assay (p = 0.015, p < 0.001, p = 0.004, respectively). INF-\u03b3-based enzyme-linked immunospot assay results were significantly higher in group 2 vs group 3 (p = 0.010). Differences between infected and uninfected children were not significant considering IL-17 assays (p = 0.431). Mycobacterium avium lysate IL-2 and INF-\u03b3-based enzyme-linked immunospot assays seem to be promising noninvasive diagnostic techniques for discriminating children with nontuberculous mycobacteria lymphadenitis and noninfected subjects."

  "description": "Transcriptome and proteome profiling of neural stem cells from the human subventricular zone in Parkinson's diseaseIt is currently accepted that the human brain has a limited neurogenic capacity and an impaired regenerative potential. We have previously shown the existence of CD271-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, which proliferate and differentiate towards neurons and glial cells in vitro. To study the molecular profile of these NSCs in detail, we performed RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry on CD271+ NSCs isolated from human post-mortem SVZ and on homogenates of the SVZ. CD271+ cells were isolated through magnetic cell separation (MACS). We first compared the molecular profile of CD271+ NSCs to the SVZ homogenate from control donors and then compared CD271+ cells to CD11b+ microglia. These results confirmed their neural stem cell identity. Finally we compared controls and PD patients to establish a specific molecular profile of NSCs and the SVZ in PD. While our transcriptome analysis did not identify any differentially expressed genes in the SVZ between control and PD patients, our proteome analysis revealed several proteins that were differentially expressed in PD. Some of these proteins are involved in cytoskeletal organization and mitochondrial function. Transcriptome and proteome analyses of NSCs from PD revealed changes in the expression of genes and proteins involved in metabolism, transcriptional activity and cytoskeletal organization. Our data suggest that NSCs may transit into a primed-quiescent state, that is in an \"alert\" non-proliferative phase in PD. Our results not only confirm pathological hallmarks of PD (e.g. impaired mitochondrial function), but also show that the NSCs from SVZ undergo significant changes at both transcriptome and proteome level following PD."

Here, we provide an atomic-level description of the surface of colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs, achieving an effective passivation strategy that leads to near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield. To this end, we used two different types of CsPbBr3 NCs, which had been synthesized with an outer shell of either oleylammonium bromide ion pairs or Cs-oleate complexes. We perturbed the dynamic equilibria at the NCs' surface with ligands from a comprehensive library, including amines (and their conjugated acids) with different basicities, chain lengths, and steric encumbrances. We demonstrate that control of both ligand binding affinity and ligand-to-NC molar ratio is essential to attain thermodynamically stable coordination of the NC surface. We thus present a reliable protocol for managing the surface chemistry of colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs and for selectively addressing their ligand-induced morphological (and structural) transformations."

  "description": "How Dihalogens Catalyze Michael Addition ReactionsWe have quantum chemically analyzed the catalytic effect of dihalogen molecules (X2=F2, Cl2, Br2, and I2) on the aza-Michael addition of pyrrolidine and methyl acrylate using relativistic density functional theory and coupled-cluster theory. Our state-of-the-art computations reveal that activation barriers systematically decrease as one goes to heavier dihalogens, from 9.4 kcal mol\u22121 for F2 to 5.7 kcal mol\u22121 for I2. Activation strain and bonding analyses identify an unexpected physical factor that controls the computed reactivity trends, namely, Pauli repulsion between the nucleophile and Michael acceptor. Thus, dihalogens do not accelerate Michael additions by the commonly accepted mechanism of an enhanced donor\u2013acceptor [HOMO(nucleophile)\u2013LUMO(Michael acceptor)] interaction, but instead through a diminished Pauli repulsion between the lone-pair of the nucleophile and the Michael acceptor's \u03c0-electron system."

  "description": "Finding functional differences between species in a microbial community: Case studies in wine fermentation and Kefir cultureMicrobial life usually takes place in a community where individuals interact, by competition for nutrients, cross-feeding, inhibition by end-products, but also by their spatial distribution. Lactic acid bacteria are prominent members of microbial communities responsible for food fermentations. Their niche in a community depends on their own properties as well as those of the other species. Here, we apply a computational approach, which uses only genomic and metagenomic information and functional annotation of genes, to find properties that distinguish a species from others in the community, as well as to follow individual species in a community. We analyzed isolated and sequenced strains from a kefir community, and metagenomes from wine fermentations. We demonstrate how the distinguishing properties of an organism lead to experimentally testable hypotheses concerning the niche and the interactions with other species. We observe, for example, that L. kefiranofaciens, a dominant organism in kefir, stands out among the Lactobacilli because it potentially has more amino acid auxotrophies. Using metagenomic analysis of industrial wine fermentations we investigate the role of an inoculated L. plantarum in malolactic fermentation. We observed that L. plantarum thrives better on white than on red wine fermentations and has the largest number of phosphotransferase system among the bacteria observed in the wine communities. Also, L. plantarum together with Pantoea, Erwinia, Asaia, Gluconobacter, and Komagataeibacter genera had the highest number of genes involved in biosynthesis of amino acids."

  "description": "Biosignature Analysis of Mars Soil Analogs from the Atacama Desert: Challenges and Implications for Future Missions to MarsThe detection of biosignatures on Mars is of outstanding interest in the current field of astrobiology and drives various fields of research, ranging from new sample collection strategies to the development of more sensitive detection techniques. Detailed analysis of the organic content in Mars analog materials collected from extreme environments on Earth improves the current understanding of biosignature preservation and detection under conditions similar to those of Mars. In this article, we examined the biological fingerprint of several locations in the Atacama Desert (Chile), which include different wet and dry, and intermediate to high elevation salt flats (also named salars). Liquid chromatography and multidimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry measurement techniques were used for the detection and analysis of amino acids extracted from the salt crusts and sediments by using sophisticated extraction procedures. Illumina 16S amplicon sequencing was used for the identification of microbial communities associated with the different sample locations. Although amino acid load and organic carbon and nitrogen quantities were generally low, it was found that most of the samples harbored complex and versatile microbial communities, which were dominated by (extremely) halophilic microorganisms (most notably by species of the Archaeal family Halobacteriaceae). The dominance of salts (i.e., halites and sulfates) in the investigated samples leaves its mark on the composition of the microbial communities but does not appear to hinder the potential of life to flourish since it can clearly adapt to the higher concentrations. Although the Atacama Desert is one of the driest and harshest environments on Earth, it is shown that there are still sub-locations where life is able to maintain a foothold, and, as such, salt flats could be considered as interesting targets for future life exploration missions on Mars."

  "description": "Predictors with regard to ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption of estimated phthalate daily intakes in pregnant women: The Barwon infant studyHuman exposure to phthalate chemicals, used in consumer product plastics, occurs throughout the day. Phthalate levels in pregnant women are associated with offspring health effects including obesity and neurodevelopmental problems. Knowledge of predictors of exposure is necessary in order to effectively reduce phthalate exposure. The present study aims to identify predictors of phthalate levels in Australian pregnant women from the Barwon Infant study birth cohort. Maternal urine samples from 841 women were analyzed for phthalate metabolites. Maternal diet and food preparation practices, use of volatile household products, household characteristics and personal care product use were assessed with questionnaires. All maternal urine contained phthalate metabolites. Maternal prenatal high-fat milk consumption was associated with higher benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) (p < 0.001), and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) (p = 0.0023). Higher phthalate levels were associated with consumption of tinned food (fish and tomatoes). Diethyl phthalate (DEP) levels were significantly higher when women reported using air freshener (35% increase, p = 0.01), aerosols (40% increase, p = 0.005), hair treatment chemicals (28% increase, p = 0.031), and chlorine (34% increase, p = 0.009) compared to no use. Maternal phthalate levels did not vary by reported plastic avoidance during pregnancy. The study showed that phthalate exposure is ubiquitous and increased by multiple factors. Future intervention studies to reduce phthalate levels among pregnant women will need to take into account the variety of sources identified in this study."

Here, we analyze the smFISH data using the freely available software FISH-quant [2]. The provided datasets are intended to assist scientists interested in setting up smFISH-IF protocol in their laboratory. Furthermore, scientists interested in the generation of imaging analysis tools for single-cell approaches may find the provided dataset useful.

  "description": "Suspect and non-targeted screening of chemicals of emerging concern for human biomonitoring, environmental health studies and support to risk assessment: From promises to challenges and harmonisation issuesLarge-scale suspect and non-targeted screening approaches based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) are today available for chemical profiling and holistic characterisation of biological samples. These advanced techniques allow the simultaneous detection of a large number of chemical features, including markers of human chemical exposure. Such markers are of interest for biomonitoring, environmental health studies and support to risk assessment. Furthermore, these screening approaches have the promising capability to detect chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), document the extent of human chemical exposure, generate new research hypotheses and provide early warning support to policy. Whilst of growing importance in the environment and food safety areas, respectively, CECs remain poorly addressed in the field of human biomonitoring. This shortfall is due to several scientific and methodological reasons, including a global lack of harmonisation. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to present an overview of the basic principles, promises and challenges of suspect and non-targeted screening approaches applied to human samples as this specific field introduce major specificities compared to other fields. Focused on liquid chromatography coupled to HRMS-based data acquisition methods, this overview addresses all steps of these new analytical workflows. Beyond this general picture, the main activities carried out on this topic within the particular framework of the European Human Biomonitoring initiative (project HBM4EU, 2017\u20132021) are described, with an emphasis on harmonisation measures."

  "description": "Varespladib inhibits the phospholipase A2 and coagulopathic activities of venom components from hemotoxic snakesPhospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes are important toxins found in many snake venoms, and they can exhibit a variety of toxic activities including causing hemolysis and/or anticoagulation. In this study, the inhibiting effects of the small molecule PLA2 inhibitor varespladib on snake venom PLA2s was investigated by nanofractionation analytics, which combined chromatography, mass spectrometry (MS), and bioassays. The venoms of the medically important snake species Bothrops asper, Calloselasma rhodostoma, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Daboia russelii, Echis carinatus, Echis ocellatus, and Oxyuranus scutellatus were separated by liquid chromatography (LC) followed by nanofractionation and interrogation of the fractions by a coagulation assay and a PLA2 assay. Next, we assessed the ability of varespladib to inhibit the activity of enzymatic PLA2s and the coagulopathic toxicities induced by fractionated snake venom toxins, and identified these bioactive venom toxins and those inhibited by varespladib by using parallel recorded LC-MS data and proteomics analysis. We demonstrated here that varespladib was not only capable of inhibiting the PLA2 activities of hemotoxic snake venoms, but can also effectively neutralize the coagulopathic toxicities (most profoundly anticoagulation) induced by venom toxins. While varespladib effectively inhibited PLA2 toxins responsible for anticoagulant effects, we also found some evidence that this inhibitory molecule can partially abrogate procoagulant venom effects caused by different toxin families. These findings further emphasize the potential clinical utility of varespladib in mitigating the toxic effects of certain snakebites."

  "description": "Viral G protein-coupled receptors as modulators of cancer hallmarksHerpesviruses encode transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which share structural homology to human chemokine receptors. These viral GPCRs include KSHV-encoded ORF74, EBV-encoded BILF1, and HCMV-encoded US28, UL33, UL78 and US27. Viral GPCRs hijack various signaling pathways and cellular networks, including pathways involved in the so-called cancer hallmarks as defined by Hanahan and Weinberg. These hallmarks describe cellular characteristics crucial for transformation and tumor progression. The cancer hallmarks involve growth factor-independent proliferation, angiogenesis, avoidance of apoptosis, invasion and metastasis, metabolic reprogramming, genetic instability and immune evasion amongst others. The role of beta herpesviruses modulating these cancer hallmarks is clearly highlighted by the proliferative and pro-angiogenic phenotype associated with KSHV infection which is largely ascribed to the ORF74-mediated modulation of signaling networks in host cells. For HCMV and Epstein-Bar encoded GPCRs, oncomodulatory effects have been described which contribute to the cancer hallmarks, thereby enhancing oncogenic development. In this review, we describe the main signaling pathways controlling the hallmarks of cancer which are affected by the betaherpesvirus encoded GPCRs. Most prominent among these involve the JAK-STAT, PI(3)K-AKT, NFkB and MAPK signaling nodes. These insights are important to effectively target these viral GPCRs and their signaling networks in betaherpesvirus-associated malignancies."

  "description": "Human cytomegalovirus-encoded G protein-coupled receptor UL33 facilitates virus dissemination via the extracellular and cell-to-cell routeHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes four G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homologs. Three of these receptors, UL78, US27 and US28, are known for their roles in HCMV dissemination and latency. Despite importance of its rodent orthologs for viral replication and pathogenesis, such a function is not reported for the HCMV-encoded GPCR UL33. Using the clinical HCMV strain Merlin, we show that UL33 facilitates both cell-associated and cell-free virus transmission. A UL33-deficient virus derivative revealed retarded virus spread, formation of less and smaller plaques, and reduced extracellular progeny during multi-cycle growth analysis in fibroblast cultures compared to parental virus. The growth of UL33-revertant, US28-deficient, and US28-revertant viruses were similar to parental virus under multistep growth conditions. UL33- and US28-deficient Merlin viruses impaired cell-associated virus spread to a similar degree. Thus, the growth defect displayed by the UL33-deficient virus but not the US28-deficient virus reflects UL33\u2019s contribution to extracellular transmission. In conclusion, UL33 facilitates cell-associated and cell-free spread of the clinical HCMV strain Merlin in fibroblast cultures."

While long-chain CP (LCCP, C>17) levels were below method detection limits (MDLs), short-chain CPs (SCCPs, C10-13) and, for the first time, medium-chain CPs (MCCPs, C14-17) and CPs with a carbon chain length of nine (CP\u2013C9) were found at many sites (88%, 81% and 88%, respectively) across the Australian continent, representing a range of environmental conditions. Applying preliminary sampling rates of the XAD-PAS for CPs, gaseous CP levels in Australian air were <MDL-1.3 and <MDL-1.8 ng/m3 for \u03a3SCCPs and \u03a3MCCPs, respectively, with a significant decreasing trend from more densely to less densely populated areas. Atmospheric median levels in this study (0.37 and 0.47 ng/m3 for SCCPs and MCCPs, respectively) were at the lower end of the median range (0.32\u201310 and 3.0\u20134.2 ng/m3 for SCCPs and MCCPs, respectively) reported for CPs at predominantly urban or industrial sites elsewhere (apart from China and extremely remote sites such as Antarctica). Principal component analysis matched the SCCP and MCCP congener group patterns in samples with those found in commercial mixtures, indicating a prevalence of less chlorinated congener groups in the Australian atmosphere. Information about the Australian production, use and disposal of CPs as well as their levels in other environmental matrices, including humans, is needed for assessing their emissions, behaviour, fate and potential exposure."

  "description": "The carboxy-terminal insert in the Q-loop is needed for functionality of Escherichia coli cytochrome bd-ICytochrome bd, a component of the prokaryotic respiratory chain, is important under physiological stress and during pathogenicity. Electrons from quinol substrates are passed on via heme groups in the CydA subunit and used to reduce molecular oxygen. Close to the quinol binding site, CydA displays a periplasmic hydrophilic loop called Q-loop that is essential for quinol oxidation. In the carboxy-terminal part of this loop, CydA from Escherichia coli and other proteobacteria harbors an insert of ~60 residues with unknown function. In the current work, we demonstrate that growth of the multiple-deletion strain E. coli MB43\u2206cydA (\u2206cydA\u2206cydB\u2206appB\u2206cyoB\u2206nuoB) can be enhanced by transformation with E. coli cytochrome bd-I and we utilize this system for assessment of Q-loop mutants. Deletion of the cytochrome bd-I Q-loop insert abolished MB43\u2206cydA growth recovery. Swapping the cytochrome bd-I Q-loop for the Q-loop from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans or Mycobacterium tuberculosis CydA, which lack the insert, did not enhance the growth of MB43\u2206cydA, whereas swapping for the Q-loop from E. coli cytochrome bd-II recovered growth. Alanine scanning experiments identified the cytochrome bd-I Q-loop insert regions Ile318-Met322, Gln338-Asp342, Tyr353-Leu357, and Thr368-Ile372 as important for enzyme functionality. Those mutants that completely failed to recover growth of MB43\u2206cydA also lacked oxygen consumption activity and heme absorption peaks. Moreover, we were not able to isolate cytochrome bd-I from these inactive mutants. The results indicate that the cytochrome bd Q-loop exhibits low plasticity and that the Q-loop insert in E. coli is needed for complete, stable, assembly of cytochrome bd-I."

  "description": "The effect of weathering on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from durable water repellent (DWR) clothingTo assess the effects of weathering on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from durable water repellent (DWR) clothing, thirteen commercial textile samples were exposed to elevated ultra violet (UV) radiation, humidity, and temperature in an aging device for 300 h, which mimics the lifespan of outdoor clothing. Before and after aging, the textile samples were extracted and analysed for the ionic PFASs (perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA)) and volatile PFASs (fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), acrylates (FTACs) and methacrylates (FTMACs)). Results showed that weathering can have an effect on PFASs used in DWR of outdoor clothing, both on the PFAS profile and on the measured concentrations. In most weathered samples the PFAA concentrations increased by 5- to more than 100-fold, while PFAAs not detected in the original textiles were detected in the weathered samples. DWR chemistries are based on side-chain fluorinated polymers. A possible explanation for the increase in concentration of the PFAAs is hydrolysis of the fluorotelomer based polymers (FTPs), or degradation of the FTOHs, which are used in the manufacturing of the FTPs. The concentrations of volatile PFASs also increased, by a factor up to 20. Suggested explanations are the degradation of the DWR polymers, making non-extractable fluorines extractable, or the transformation or degradation of unknown precursors. Further research is needed to unravel the details of these processes and to determine the transformation routes. This study shows that setting maximum tolerance limits only for a few individual PFASs is not sufficient to control these harmful substances in outdoor clothing."

Since endocrine disruption (ED)-induced developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) is hardly covered by the chemical testing tools that are currently in regulatory use, the Horizon 2020 research and innovation action ENDpoiNTs has been launched to fill the scientific and methodological gaps related to the assessment of this type of chemical toxicity. The ENDpoiNTs project will generate new knowledge about ED-induced DNT and aims to develop and improve in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models pertaining to ED-linked DNT outcomes for chemical testing. This will be achieved by establishing correlative and causal links between known and novel neurodevelopmental endpoints and endocrine pathways through integration of molecular, cellular, and organismal data from in vitro and in vivo models. Based on this knowledge, the project aims to provide adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for ED-induced DNT and to develop and integrate new testing tools with high relevance for human health into European and international regulatory frameworks."

  "description": "Nanocrystals of Lead Chalcohalides: A Series of Kinetically Trapped Metastable NanostructuresWe report the colloidal synthesis of a series of surfactant-stabilized lead chalcohalide nanocrystals. Our work is mainly focused on Pb4S3Br2, a chalcohalide phase unknown to date that does not belong to the ambient-pressure PbS-PbBr2 phase diagram. The Pb4S3Br2 nanocrystals herein feature a remarkably narrow size distribution (with a size dispersion as low as 5%), a good size tunability (from 7 to \u223c30 nm), an indirect bandgap, photoconductivity (responsivity = 4 \u00b1 1 mA/W), and stability for months in air. A crystal structure is proposed for this new material by combining the information from 3D electron diffraction and electron tomography of a single nanocrystal, X-ray powder diffraction, and density functional theory calculations. Such a structure is closely related to that of the recently discovered high-pressure chalcohalide Pb4S3I2 phase, and indeed we were able to extend our synthesis scheme to Pb4S3I2 colloidal nanocrystals, whose structure matches the one that has been published for the bulk. Finally, we could also prepare nanocrystals of Pb3S2Cl2, which proved to be a structural analogue of the recently reported bulk Pb3Se2Br2 phase. It is remarkable that one high-pressure structure (for Pb4S3I2) and two metastable structures that had not yet been reported (for Pb4S3Br2 and Pb3S2Cl2) can be prepared on the nanoscale by wet-chemical approaches. This highlights the important role of colloidal chemistry in the discovery of new materials and motivates further exploration into metal chalcohalide nanocrystals."

  "description": "Through-Space Polar-\u03c0 Interactions in 2,6-DiarylthiophenolsMolecular recognition between polar groups and aromatic molecules is fundamentally important to rational drug design. Although it has been well established that many polar functionalities interact with electron-rich aromatic residues through energetically favorable polar-\u03c0 interactions, there is a limited understanding of the association between thiols and aromatic systems. Herein we report physical-organic chemistry studies on 2,6-diarylthiophenols that possess the central thiophenol ring and two flanking aromatic rings with tunable electronic properties caused by substituents at distant para position. Hammett analysis revealed that pKa values and proton affinities correlate well with Hammett sigma values of substituents. Additional energy decomposition analysis supported the conclusion that both through-space SH-\u03c0 interactions and S\u2212-\u03c0 interactions contribute to intramolecular stabilization of 2,6-diarylthiophenols."

The computed excitation in case of GH PBE0 is most accurate while the trend is most systematic with RSH LCY-BLYP compared to \u03bbmax. We highlight the importance of including solvent effects for optimal agreement with the \u03bbmax. Increasing the basis set size from TZ2P to QZ4P has a negligible influence on the computed excitation energies. Notably, RSH CAMY-B3LYP gave the least error for charge-transfer excitation. The poorest agreement with \u03bbmax is obtained with semi-local GGA functionals. Use of the optimally-tuned RSH LCY-BLYP* is not recommended because of the high computational cost and marginal improvement in results."

  "description": "Unary Words Have the Smallest Levenshtein k-NeighbourhoodsThe edit distance (a.k.a. the Levenshtein distance) between two words is defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions or substitutions of letters needed to transform one word into another. The Levenshtein k-neighbourhood of a word w is the set of words that are at edit distance at most k from w. This is perhaps the most important concept underlying BLAST, a widely-used tool for comparing biological sequences. A natural combinatorial question is to ask for upper and lower bounds on the size of this set. The answer to this question has important algorithmic implications as well. Myers notes that \"such bounds would give a tighter characterisation of the running time of the algorithm\" behind BLAST. We show that the size of the Levenshtein k-neighbourhood of any word of length n over an arbitrary alphabet is not smaller than the size of the Levenshtein k-neighbourhood of a unary word of length n, thus providing a tight lower bound on the size of the Levenshtein k-neighbourhood. We remark that this result was posed as a conjecture by Dufresne at WCTA 2019. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation ! Pattern matching."

We also examined the effects of replacing Na+ with Ag+ cations by preparing and characterizing Cs2Na1-xAgxBiCl6 alloy NCs with x ranging from 0 to 1. Whereas Cs2NaBiCl6 NCs were not emissive, Cs2Na1-xAgxBiCl6 NCs featured a broad photoluminescence band at \u223c690 nm, Stokes-shifted from the respective absorption by \u22651.5 eV. The emission efficiency was maximized for low Ag+ amounts, reaching \u223c3% for the Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6 composition. Density functional theory calculations coupled with spectroscopic investigations revealed that Cs2Na1-xAgxBiCl6 NCs are characterized by a complex photophysics stemming from the interplay of (i) radiative recombination via trapped excitons localized in spatially connected AgCl6-BiCl6 octahedra; (ii) surface traps, located on undercoordinated surface Bi centers, behaving as phonon-assisted nonradiative decay channels; and (iii) a thermal equilibrium between trapping and detrapping processes. These results offer insights into developing double-perovskite NCs with enhanced optoelectronic efficiency. "

  "description": "Recent Developments in Linear Interaction Energy Based Binding Free Energy CalculationsThe linear interaction energy (LIE) approach is an end\u2013point method to compute binding affinities. As such it combines explicit conformational sampling (of the protein-bound and unbound-ligand states) with efficiency in calculating values for the protein-ligand binding free energy \u0394Gbind. This perspective summarizes our recent efforts to use molecular simulation and empirically calibrated LIE models for accurate and efficient calculation of \u0394Gbind for diverse sets of compounds binding to flexible proteins (e.g., Cytochrome P450s and other proteins of direct pharmaceutical or biochemical interest). Such proteins pose challenges on \u0394Gbind computation, which we tackle using a previously introduced statistically weighted LIE scheme. Because calibrated LIE models require empirical fitting of scaling parameters, they need to be accompanied with an applicability domain (AD) definition to provide a measure of confidence for predictions for arbitrary query compounds within a reference frame defined by a collective chemical and interaction space. To enable AD assessment of LIE predictions (or other protein-structure and -dynamic based \u0394Gbind calculations) we recently introduced strategies for AD assignment of LIE models, based on simulation and training data only. These strategies are reviewed here as well, together with available tools to facilitate and/or automate LIE computation (including software for combined statistically-weighted LIE calculations and AD assessment)."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine-disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower than S-EDCs. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea, and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

Partial inhibition of multiple components in the same oncogenic signalling pathway may add up to complete pathway inhibition, while decreasing the selective pressure on each component to acquire a resistance mutation. We report here testing of this Multiple Low Dose (MLD) therapy model in EGFR mutant NSCLC. We show that as little as 20% of the individual effective drug doses is sufficient to completely block MAPK signalling and proliferation when used in 3D (RAF\u2009+\u2009MEK\u2009+\u2009ERK) or 4D (EGFR\u2009+\u2009RAF\u2009+\u2009MEK\u2009+\u2009ERK) inhibitor combinations. Importantly, EGFR mutant NSCLC cells treated with MLD therapy do not develop resistance. Using several animal models, we find durable responses to MLD therapy without associated toxicity. Our data support the notion that MLD therapy could deliver clinical benefit, even for those having acquired resistance to third generation EGFR inhibitor therapy."

  "description": "Development of a Conformational Histamine H3Receptor Biosensor for the Synchronous Screening of Agonists and Inverse AgonistsThe histamine H3 receptor (H3R) represents a highly attractive drug target for the treatment of various central nervous system disorders, but the discovery of novel H3R targeting compounds relies on the assessment of highly amplified intracellular signaling events that do not only reflect H3R modulation and carry the risk of high false-positive and -negative screening rates. To address these limitations, we designed an intramolecular H3R biosensor based on the principle of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) that reports the receptor's real-time conformational dynamics and provides an advanced tool to screen for both H3R agonists and inverse agonists in a live cell screening-compatible assay format. This conformational G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) sensor allowed us to characterize the pharmacological properties of known and new H3 receptor ligands with unprecedented accuracy. Interestingly, we found that one newly developed H3 receptor ligand possesses even stronger inverse agonistic activity than reference H3R inverse agonists including the current gold standard pitolisant. Taken together, we describe here the design and validation of the first screening-compatible H3R conformational biosensor that will aid in the discovery of novel H3R ligands and can be employed to gain deeper insights into the (in-)activation mechanism of this highly attractive drug target.

On the other hand, its unique architecture also makes it a suitable target for antibiotic interference. In particular, essential multiprotein machines that are required for biogenesis of the outer membrane have attracted attention in antibacterial design strategies.

  "description": "Controlling the selectivity of aminergic GPCR ligands from the extracellular vestibuleIn addition to the orthosteric binding pocket (OBP) of GPCRs, recent structural studies have revealed that there are several allosteric sites available for pharmacological intervention. The secondary binding pocket (SBP) of aminergic GPCRs is located in the extracellular vestibule of these receptors, and it has been suggested to be a potential selectivity pocket for bitopic ligands. Here, we applied a virtual screening protocol based on fragment docking to the SBP of the orthosteric ligand-receptor complex. This strategy was employed for a number of aminergic receptors. First, we designed dopamine D3 preferring bitopic compounds from a D2 selective orthosteric ligand. Next, we designed 5-HT2B selective bitopic compounds starting from the 5-HT1B preferring ergoline core of LSD. Comparing the serotonergic profiles of the new derivatives to that of LSD, we found that these derivatives became significantly biased towards the desired 5-HT2B receptor target. Finally, addressing the known limitations of H1 antihistamines, our protocol was successfully used to eliminate the well-known side effects related to the muscarinic M1 activity of amitriptyline while preserving H1 potency in some of the designed bitopic compounds. These applications highlight the usefulness of our new virtual screening protocol and offer a powerful strategy towards bitopic GPCR ligands with designed receptor profiles."

  "description": "Different resource allocation in a bacillus subtilis population displaying bimodal motilityTo cope with sudden changes in their environment, bacteria can use a bet-hedging strategy by dividing the population into cells with different properties. This so-called bimodal or bistable cellular differentiation is generally controlled by positive feedback regulation of transcriptional activators. Due to the continuous increase in cell volume, it is difficult for these activators to reach an activation threshold concentration when cells are growing exponentially. This is one reason why bimodal differentiation is primarily observed from the onset of the stationary phase, when exponential growth ceases. An exception is the bimodal induction of motility in Bacillus subtilis, which occurs early during exponential growth. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain this, including double-negative feedback regulation and the stability of the mRNA molecules involved. In this study, we used fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) to compare the transcriptomes of motile and nonmotile cells and noted that expression of ribosomal genes is lower in motile cells. This was confirmed using an unstable green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter fused to the strong ribosomal rpsD promoter. We propose that the reduction in ribosomal gene expression in motile cells is the result of a diversion of cellular resources to the synthesis of the chemotaxis and motility systems. In agreement with this, single-cell microscopic analysis showed that motile cells are slightly shorter than nonmotile cells, an indication of slower growth. We speculate that this growth rate reduction can contribute to the bimodal induction of motility during exponential growth."

We determined the developmental toxicity profile of ultrapure PCB 180 in developing offspring following in utero and lactational exposure with the focus on endocrine, metabolic and retinoid system alterations. Pregnant rats were given total doses of 0, 10, 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg PCB 180/kg bw on gestational days 7-10 by oral gavage, and the offspring were sampled on postnatal days (PND) 7, 35 and 84. Decreased serum testosterone and triiodothyronine concentrations on PND 84, altered liver retinoid levels, increased liver weights and induced 7-pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity were the sensitive effects used for margin of exposure (MoE) calculations. Liver weights were increased together with induction of the metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B1, CYP3A1, and CYP1A1. Less sensitive effects included decreased serum estradiol and increased luteinizing hormone levels in females, decreased prostate and seminal vesicle weight and increased pituitary weight in males, increased cortical bone area and thickness of tibial diaphysis in females and decreased cortical bone mineral density in males. Developmental toxicity profiles were partly different in male and female offspring, males being more sensitive to increased liver weight, PROD induction and decreased thyroxine concentrations. MoE assessment indicated that the 95th percentile of current maternal PCB 180 concentrations do not exceed the estimated tolerable human lipid-based PCB 180 concentration. Although PCB 180 is much less potent than dioxin-like compounds, it shares several toxicological targets suggesting a potential for interactions."

  "description": "Evaluation of a human iPSC-derived BBB model for repeated dose toxicity testing with cyclosporine A as model compoundThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly restrictive barrier that preserves central nervous system homeostasis and ensures optimal brain functioning. Using BBB cell assays makes it possible to investigate whether a compound is likely to compromise BBBs functionality, thereby probably resulting in neurotoxicity. Recently, several protocols to obtain human brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been reported. Within the framework of the European MSCA-ITN in3 project, we explored the possibility to use an iPSC-derived BBB model to assess the effects of repeated dose treatment with chemicals, using Cyclosporine A (CsA) as a model compound. The BLECs were found to exhibit important BBB characteristics up to 15 days after the end of the differentiation and could be used to assess the effects of repeated dose treatment. Although BLECs were still undergoing transcriptional changes over time, a targeted transcriptome analysis (TempO-Seq) indicated a time and concentration dependent activation of ATF4, XBP1, Nrf2 and p53 stress response pathways under CsA treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that this iPSC-derived BBB model and iPSC-derived models in general hold great potential to study the effects of repeated dose exposure with chemicals, allowing personalized and patient-specific studies in the future."

  "description": "Growth, dormancy and lysis: the complex relation of starter culture physiology and cheese flavour formationFast acidification and growth are desired from lactic acid bacteria starter cultures during food fermentation to minimise the risk of spoilage and process failure. In addition, starter cultures play a predominant role in the formation of flavour volatiles. Recent studies in different microbial species have shown that high growth rates come at the expense of the expression level of metabolic enzymes and/or stress proteins. In starter cultures, such a trade-off would affect flavour formation, which depends on the level of flavour-forming enzymes and the prolonged survival of cells. Moreover, starter culture performance during cheese ripening could also be influenced by its cultivation history due to the low number of divisions during cheese manufacturing and limited proteome adjustment during ripening. These findings indicate that changes in (pre)-culture conditions can modulate proteome allocation and metabolic stability in starter cultures, and thereby provide novel approaches to steer flavour formation."

  "description": "Limited lactosylation of beta-lactoglobulin from cow\u2019s milk exerts strong influence on antigenicity and degranulation of mast cellsBackground: beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) is one of the major cow\u2019s milk proteins and the most abundant allergen in whey. Heating is a common technologic treatment applied during milk transformational processes. Maillardation of BLG in the presence of reducing sugars and elevated temperatures may influence its antigenicity and allergenicity. Primary objective: to analyze and identify lactosylation sites by capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Secondary objective: to assess the effect of lactosylated BLG on antigenicity and degranulation of mast cells. Methods: BLG was lactosylated at pH 7, a water activity (aw) of 0.43, and a temperature of 65\u25e6C using a molar ratio BLG:lactose of 1:1 by incubating for 0, 3, 8, 16 or 24 h. For the determination of the effect on antibody-binding capacity of lactosylated BLG, an ELISA was performed. For the assessment of degranulation of the cell-line RBL-h\u03b5Ia-2B12 transfected with the human \u03b1-chain, Fc\u03b5 receptor type 1 (Fc\u03b5RI) was used. Results: BLG showed saturated lactosylation between 8 and 16 incubation hours in our experimental setup. Initial stage lactosylation sites L1 (N-terminus)\u2014K47, K60, K75, K77, K91, K138 and K141\u2014have been identified using CE-MS. Lactosylated BLG showed a significant reduction of both the IgG binding (p = 0.0001) as well as degranulation of anti-BLG IgE-sensitized RBL-h\u03b5Ia-2B12 cells (p < 0.0001). Conclusions and clinical relevance: this study shows that lactosylation of BLG decreases both the antigenicity and degranulation of mast cells and can therefore be a promising approach for reducing allergenicity of cow\u2019s milk allergens provided that the process is well-controlled."

  "description": "Model Selection Reveals the Butyrate-Producing Gut Bacterium Coprococcus eutactus as Predictor for Language Development in 3-Year-Old Rural Ugandan ChildrenIntroduction: The metabolic activity of the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the gut-brain axis through the effects of bacterial metabolites on brain function and development. In this study we investigated the association of gut microbiota composition with language development of 3-year-old rural Ugandan children. Methods: We studied the language ability in 139 children of 36 months in our controlled maternal education intervention trial to stimulate children\u2019s growth and development. The dataset includes 1170 potential predictors, including anthropometric and cognitive parameters at 24 months, 542 composition parameters of the children\u2019s gut microbiota at 24 months and 621 of these parameters at 36 months. We applied a novel computationally efficient version of the all-subsets regression methodology and identified predictors of language ability of 36-months-old children scored according to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III). Results: The best three-term model, selected from more than 266 million models, includes the predictors Coprococcus eutactus at 24 months of age, Bifidobacterium at 36 months of age, and language development at 24 months. The top 20 four-term models, selected from more than 77 billion models, consistently include C. eutactus abundance at 24 months, while 14 of these models include the other two predictors as well. Mann\u2013Whitney U tests suggest that the abundance of gut bacteria in language non-impaired children (n = 78) differs from that in language impaired children (n = 61). While anaerobic butyrate-producers, including C. eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Holdemanella biformis, Roseburia hominis are less abundant, facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Granulicatella elegans, Escherichia/Shigella and Campylobacter coli, are more abundant in language impaired children. The overall predominance of oxygen tolerant species in the gut microbiota was slightly higher in the language impaired group than in the non-impaired group (P = 0.09). Conclusion: Application of the all-subsets regression methodology to microbiota data established a correlation between the relative abundance of the anaerobic butyrate-producing gut bacterium C. eutactus and language development in Ugandan children. We propose that the gut redox potential and the overall bacterial butyrate-producing capacity in the gut are important factors for language development."

  "description": "Results of WEPAL-QUASIMEME/NORMANs first global interlaboratory study on microplastics reveal urgent need for harmonizationTo survey the conformity and quality of results among laboratories for microplastics determination worldwide, an international laboratory intercomparison and development exercise was organized. The 34 participants were requested to determine the polymer type and number or mass of polymer particles in 12 samples, i.e. six samples containing of pre-production pellets, five dissolvable soda tablets containing different (smaller) polymer particles and one blank soda tablet. A novel method for providing the test materials in aluminium strips was used. Thirty laboratories (88%) submitted data using their own method of choice, resulting in a variety of identification and quantification methods (n = 7). The majority of the labs (53\u2013100%) correctly identified the type of polymer in all samples but one. The performance of the laboratories in quantifying and weighing the pellets was very good. The analysis of the number of the particles in the soda tablets varied considerably between laboratories (29\u201391%). The results of this study highlight the complexity of microplastics analysis and the need for harmonization of both reporting format and methods. Continued development and assessment of the comparability among analytical methods and laboratories are urgently needed to support monitoring programmes, research and decision-making."

Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied for example, as inhibitors of protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs). Even though \u03b2-sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure-based design of \u03b2-sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein \u03b2-catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of \u03b2-catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with \u03b2-catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic \u03b2-sheet mimetics employing a late-stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to \u03b2-catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other \u03b2-sheet-mediated PPIs."

  "description": "A yeast FRET biosensor enlightens cAMP signalingThe cAMP-PKA signaling cascade in budding yeast regulates adaptation to changing environments. We developed yEPAC, a FRET-based biosensor for cAMP measurements in yeast. We used this sensor with flow cytometry for high-throughput single cell-level quantification during dynamic changes in response to sudden nutrient transitions. We found that the characteristic cAMP peak differentiates between different carbon source transitions and is rather homogenous among single cells, especially for transitions to glucose. The peaks are mediated by a combination of extracellular sensing and intracellular metabolism. Moreover, the cAMP peak follows the Weber-Fechner law; its height scales with the relative, and not the absolute, change in glucose. Last, our results suggest that the cAMP peak height conveys information about prospective growth rates. In conclusion, our yEPAC-sensor makes possible new avenues for understanding yeast physiology, signaling, and metabolic adaptation."

  "description": "Decabromodiphenylether trends in the European environment: Bird eggs, sewage sludge and surficial sedimentsConcern on relatively high levels and the potential bioaccumulation of decabromodiphenylether (BDE209) has led to a European 8-year monitoring program on trends in BDE209 concentrations in birds, sewage sludge and sediments from seven countries. BDE209 was analysed in four environmental matrices: sparrowhawk eggs (UK), glaucous gull eggs (Bear Island, Norway), sewage sludge (UK, Ireland and the Netherlands) and sediment (France, Germany, the Netherlands, UK and Ireland). BDE209 was detected in most of the glaucous gull and sparrow hawk eggs but neither increasing nor decreasing trends in these BDE209 levels were observed. An indication for debromination of BDE209 in sparrowhawk eggs was found. BDE209 concentrations in sediments ranged from very low ng/g (88 ng/g on an organic carbon (OC) basis) concentrations, in the rivers Elbe, Ems, Seine and the Outer Humber, to high \u03bcg/g (120 \u03bcg/g OC), in the Western Scheldt, Liverpool Bay and River Mersey. Apart from decreasing values in the Western Scheldt sediment no further decreases in BDE209 concentrations were observed over time, neither in sediment nor in sewage sludge showing that the voluntary emissions control program of the bromine industry only had a local effect. In contrast to the sewage sludge samples from the Netherlands (mean 355 ng/g dry weight (dw) or 1026 ng/g OC), the BDE209 concentrations in the UK increased at all sites from 2006 to 2011 (8092 ng/g dw or 22,367 ng/g OC). The BDE209 levels in several UK sediments and sewage sludge were still very high at the end of the program in 2012, most likely caused by frequent use of BDE209 in the textile industry. This may be indicative of the persistence of BDE209 and the limited degradation into lower brominated congeners in sediment, although it cannot be excluded that ongoing BDE209 emissions have played a role as well."

There is a need for a combination of in vitro and in silico tests for the assessment of chemically induced DNT in humans. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo (ZFE) provides a powerful model to study DNT because it shows fast neurodevelopment with a large resemblance to the higher vertebrate, including the human system. One of the suitable readouts for DNT testing in the zebrafish is neurobehaviour (stimulus-provoked locomotion) since this provides integrated information on the functionality and status of the entire nervous system of the embryo. In the current study, environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals and their mixtures were investigated using the zebrafish light-dark transition test. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to three neuroactive compounds of concern, carbamazepine (CBZ), fluoxetine (FLX), and venlafaxine (VNX), as well as their main metabolites, carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (CBZ 10,11E), norfluoxetine (norFLX), and desvenlafaxine (desVNX). All the studied compounds, except CBZ 10,11E, dose-dependently inhibited zebrafish locomotor activity, providing a distinct behavioural phenotype. Mixture experiments with these pharmaceuticals identified that dose addition was confirmed for all the studied binary mixtures (CBZ-FLX, CBZ-VNX, and VNX-FLX), thereby supporting the zebrafish embryo as a model for studying the cumulative effect of chemical mixtures in DNT. This study shows that pharmaceuticals and a mixture thereof affect locomotor activity in zebrafish. The test is directly applicable in environmental risk assessment; however, further studies are required to assess the relevance of these findings for developmental neurotoxicity in humans."

  "description": "Chemically Triggered Formation of Two-Dimensional Epitaxial Quantum Dot SuperlatticesTwo dimensional superlattices of epitaxially connected quantum dots enable size-quantization effects to be combined with high charge carrier mobilities, an essential prerequisite for highly performing QD devices based on charge transport. Here, we demonstrate that surface active additives known to restore nanocrystal stoichiometry can trigger the formation of epitaxial superlattices of PbSe and PbS quantum dots. More specifically, we show that both chalcogen-adding (sodium sulfide) and lead oleate displacing (amines) additives induce small area epitaxial superlattices of PbSe quantum dots. In the latter case, the amine basicity is a sensitive handle to tune the superlattice symmetry, with strong and weak bases yielding pseudohexagonal or quasi-square lattices, respectively. Through density functional theory calculations and in situ titrations monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we link this observation to the concomitantly different coordination enthalpy and ligand displacement potency of the amine. Next to that, an initial \u223c10% reduction of the initial ligand density prior to monolayer formation and addition of a mild, lead oleate displacing chemical trigger such as aniline proved key to induce square superlattices with long-range, square micrometer order; an effect that is the more pronounced the larger the quantum dots. Because the approach applies to PbS quantum dots as well, we conclude that it offers a reproducible and rational method for the formation of highly ordered epitaxial quantum dot superlattices. KEYWORDS: nanomaterials, PbSe, self-assembly, quantum-dot solid, surface chemistry C olloidal nanocrystals made by highly precise synthesis methods such as hot injection have been widely used as building blocks of self-assembled nanocrystal superlattices. 1\u22125 Especially in the case of semiconductor nanocrystals or quantum dots (QDs), formation of highly involved binary or ternary superstructures has been demon-strated, 6\u221210 the symmetry of which could be rationalized using hard sphere crystallization theory. 10\u221213 Whereas this provides ample possibilities to combine different nanocrystals in a single ordered crystal, only a few studies have shown such an approach to result in metamaterials with new or enhanced properties. 14\u221216 For one thing, this is due to the use of nanocrystal building blocks capped by long, organic ligands, which inevitably leads to electrically insulating nanocrystal solids. Therefore, optoelectronic devices, such as transis-tors, 17\u221219 solar cells, 20\u221223 or photodetectors, 24\u221226 are based on disordered QD solids, where the interparticle distance is usually decreased by exchanging the long organic ligands with shorter organic or inorganic moieties. 27\u221231 Although this makes for QD devices with ever increasing performance, carrier mobilities remain well below 10 cm 2 V \u22121 s \u22121 and the approach leaves no room for any symmetry-induced collective effects."

  "description": "Taking chances and making mistakes: non-genetic phenotypic heterogeneity and its consequences for surviving in dynamic environmentsNatural selection has shaped the strategies for survival and growth of microorganisms. The success of microorganisms depends not only on slow evolutionary tuning but also on the ability to adapt to unpredictable changes in their environment. In principle, adaptive strategies range from purely deterministic mechanisms to those that exploit the randomness intrinsic to many cellular and molecular processes. Depending on the environment and selective pressures, particular strategies can lie somewhere along this continuum. In recent years, non-genetic cell-to-cell differences have received a lot of attention, not least because of their potential impact on the ability of microbial populations to survive in dynamic environments. Using several examples, we describe the origins of spontaneous and induced mechanisms of phenotypic adaptation. We identify some of the commonalities of these examples and consider the potential role of chance and constraints in microbial phenotypic adaptation."

The conference gathered speakers from academia and industry considered to be world leaders in the molecular pharmacology and signaling of GPCRs, with a particular interest in the development of therapeutic GPCR antibodies (Abs). The main topics were new advances and challenges in the development of antibodies targeting GPCRs and their potential applications to the study of the structure and function of GPCRs, as well as their implication in physiology and pathophysiology. The conference included 2 sessions, with the first dedicated to the recent advances in methodological strategies used for GPCR immunization using thermo-stabilized and purified GPCRs, and the development of various formats of Abs such as monoclonal IgG, single-chain variable fragments and nanobodies (Nbs) by in vitro and in silico approaches. The second session focused on GPCR Nbs as a \u201chot\u201d field of research on GPCRs. This session started with discussion of the pioneering Nbs developed against GPCRs and their application to structural studies, then transitioned to talks on original ex vivo and in vivo studies on GPCR-selective Nbs showing promising therapeutic applications of Nbs in important physiologic systems, such as the central nervous and the immune systems, as well as in cancer. The conference ended with the consensus that Abs and especially Nbs are opening a new era of research on GPCR structure, pharmacology and pathophysiology."

Currently, several computational methods are available and are widely applied to detect numerical copy number aberrations (CNAs) of chromosomal segments in tumor genomes. However, there is lack of computational methods that systematically detect structural chromosomal aberrations by virtue of the genomic location of CNA-associated chromosomal breaks and identify genes that appear non-randomly affected by chromosomal breakpoints across (large) series of tumor samples. \u2018GeneBreak\u2019 is developed to systematically identify genes recurrently affected by the genomic location of chromosomal CNA-associated breaks by a genome-wide approach, which can be applied to DNA copy number data obtained by array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) or by (low-pass) whole genome sequencing (WGS). First, \u2018GeneBreak\u2019 collects the genomic locations of chromosomal CNA-associated breaks that were previously pinpointed by the segmentation algorithm that was applied to obtain CNA profiles. Next, a tailored annotation approach for breakpoint-to-gene mapping is implemented. Finally, dedicated cohort-based statistics is incorporated with correction for covariates that influence the probability to be a breakpoint gene. In addition, multiple testing correction is integrated to reveal recurrent breakpoint events. This easy-to-use algorithm, \u2018GeneBreak\u2019, is implemented in R (www.cran.r-project.org) and is available from Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeneBreak.html). "

  "description": "Simple Fully Nonlocal Density Functionals for Electronic Repulsion EnergyFrom a simplified version of the mathematical structure of the strong coupling limit of the exact exchange-correlation functional, we construct an approximation for the electronic repulsion energy at physical coupling strength, which is fully nonlocal. This functional is self-interaction free and yields energy densities within the definition of the electrostatic potential of the exchange-correlation hole that are locally accurate and have the correct asymptotic behavior. The model is able to capture strong correlation effects that arise from chemical bond dissociation, without relying on error cancellation. These features, which are usually missed by standard density functional theory (DFT) functionals, are captured by the highly nonlocal structure, which goes beyond the \"Jacob's ladder\" framework for functional construction, by using integrals of the density as the key ingredient. Possible routes for obtaining the full exchange-correlation functional by recovering the missing kinetic component of the correlation energy are also implemented and discussed."

A fused NDI-salphen (NDI=naphthalene diimide) prototypic artificial photosynthesis material, DATZnS, is shown to be comprised of a phenazine motif, in which the alignment of electric dipole moments in a P2/c supramolecular scaffold can be modulated with bulky substituents. They can also be switched between parallel stacks of dipoles running antiparallel in the DATZnS-H compared with parallel stacks of dipoles in polar layers running in opposite directions in the DATZnS(3\u2032-NMe) parent compound. Spatial correlations obtained from HETCOR spectra, collected with a long cross polarization contact time of 2 ms, reveal an antiparallel stacking for the DATZnS-H homologue. These constraints and limited data from TEM are used to construct a structural model within the P2/c space group determined by the molecular C2 symmetry. By using homology modelling, a pseudo octahedral coordination of the Zn is shown to follow the packing-induced chirality with enantiomeric pairs of the \u039b and \u0394 forms alternating along antiparallel stacks. The model helps to understand how the steric hindrance modulates the self-assembly in this novel class of fused materials by steric hindrance at the molecular level."

  "description": "Bioaccumulation of PCBs from microplastics in Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus): An experimental studyPlastic debris acts as a sorbent phase for hydrophobic organic compounds like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Chemical partitioning models predict that the ingestion of microplastics with adsorbed chemicals in the field will tend not to result in significant net desorption of the chemical to the organism's tissues. This is expected due to the often limited differences in fugacity of the chemical between the indigestible plastic materials and the tissues, which are typically already exposed in the same environment to the same chemicals as the plastic. However laboratory trials validating these model predictions are scarce. In this study, PCB-loaded microplastics were offered to field-collected Norway lobsters (Nephrops norvegicus) during in vivo feeding laboratory experiments. Each ingestion experiment was repeated with and without loading a mixture of ten PCB congeners onto plastic microspheres (MS) made of polyethylene (PE) and polystyrene (PS) with diameters of either 500\u2013600 \u03bcm or 6 \u03bcm. We observed that the presence of chemicals adsorbed to ingested microplastics did not lead to significant bioaccumulation of the chemicals in the exposed organisms. There was a limited uptake of PCBs in Nephrops tail tissue after ingestion of PCB-loaded PE MS, while almost no PCBs were detected in animals exposed to PS MS. In general, our results demonstrated that after 3 weeks of exposure the ingestion of plastic MS themselves did not affect the nutritional state of wild Nephrops."

  "description": "Coulomb couplings in solubilised light harvesting complex II (LHCII): challenging the ideal dipole approximation from TDDFT calculationsThe light harvesting complex II (LHCII), is a pigment\u2013protein complex responsible for most of the light harvesting in plants. LHCII harvests sunlight and transfers excitation energy to the reaction centre of the photo-system, where the water oxidation process takes place. The energetics of LHCII can be modulated by means of conformational changes allowing a switch from a harvesting to a quenched state. In this state, the excitation energy is no longer transferred but converted into thermal energy to prevent photooxidation. Based on molecular dynamics simulations at the microsecond time scale, we have recently proposed that the switch between different fluorescent states can be probed by correlating shifts in the chromophore\u2013chromophore Coulomb interactions to particular protein movements. However, these findings are based upon calculations in the ideal point dipole approximation (IDA) where the Coulomb couplings are simplified as first order dipole\u2013dipole interactions, also assuming that the chromophore transition dipole moments lay in particular directions of space with constant moduli (FIX-IDA). In this work, we challenge this approximation using the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) combined with the frozen density embedding (FDE) approach. Our aim is to establish up to which limit FIX-IDA can be applied and which chromophore types are better described under this approximation. For that purpose, we use the classical trajectories of solubilised light harvesting complex II (LHCII) we have recently reported [Liguori et al., Sci. Rep., 2015, 5, 15661] and selected three pairs of chromophores containing chlorophyll and carotenoids (Chl and Car): Chla611\u2013Chla612, Chlb606\u2013Chlb607 and Chla612\u2013Lut620. Using the FDE in the Tamm\u2013Dancoff approximation (FDEc-TDA), we show that IDA is accurate enough for predicting Chl\u2013Chl Coulomb couplings. However, the FIX-IDA largely overestimates Chl\u2013Car interactions mainly because the transition dipole for the Cars is not trivially oriented on the polyene chain."

  "description": "A quantitative analysis of light-driven charge transfer processes using voronoi partitioning of time dependent DFT-derived electron densitiesAn analytical method is presented that provides quantitative insight into light-driven electron density rearrangement using the output of standard time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) computations on molecular compounds. Using final and initial electron densities for photochemical processes, the subtraction of summed electron density in each atom-centered Voronoi polyhedron yields the electronic charge difference, QVECD. This subtractive method can also be used with Bader, Mulliken and Hirshfeld charges. A validation study shows QVECD to have the most consistent performance across basis sets and good conservation of charge between electronic states. Besides vertical transitions, relaxation processes can be investigated as well. Significant electron transfer is computed for isomerization on the excited state energy surface of azobenzene. A number of linear anilinepyridinium donor-bridge-acceptor chromophores was examined using QVECD to unravel the influence of its pi-conjugated bridge on charge separation. Finally, the usefulness of the presented method as a tool in optimizing charge transfer is shown for a homologous series of organometallic pigments. The presented work allows facile calculation of a novel, relevant quantity describing charge transfer processes at the atomic level."

  "description": "Accelerating early antituberculosis drug discovery by creating mycobacterial indicator strains that predict mode of actionDue to the rise of drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, there is an urgent need for novel antibiotics to effectively combat these cases and shorten treatment regimens. Recently, drug screens using whole-cell analyses have been shown to be successful. However, current high-throughput screens focus mostly on stricto sensu life/death screening that give little qualitative information. In doing so, promising compound scaffolds or nonoptimized compounds that fail to reach inhibitory concentrations are missed. To accelerate early tuberculosis (TB) drug discovery, we performed RNA sequencing on Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum to map the stress responses that follow upon exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics with known targets, ciprofloxacin, ethambutol, isoniazid, streptomycin, and rifampin. The resulting data set comprises the first overview of transcriptional stress responses of mycobacteria to different antibiotics. We show that antibiotics can be distinguished based on their specific transcriptional stress fingerprint. Notably, this fingerprint was more distinctive in M. marinum. We decided to use this to our advantage and continue with this model organism. A selection of diverse antibiotic stress genes was used to construct stress reporters. In total, three functional reporters were constructed to respond to DNA damage, cell wall damage, and ribosomal inhibition. Subsequently, these reporter strains were used to screen a small anti-TB compound library to predict the mode of action. In doing so, we identified the putative modes of action for three novel compounds, which confirms the utility of our approach."

  "description": "A combined computational and experimental study on selective flucloxacillin hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 BM3 variantsThe 5\u2032-hydroxymethyl metabolite of the penicillin based antibiotic flucloxacillin (FLX) is considered to be involved in bile duct damage occurring in a small number of patients. Because 5\u2032-hydroxymethyl FLX is difficult to obtain by organic synthesis, biosynthesis using highly active and regioselective biocatalysts would be an alternative approach. By screening an in-house library of Cytochrome P450 (CYP) BM3 mutants, mutant M11 L437E was identified as a regioselective enzyme with relatively high activity in production of 5\u2032-hydroxymethyl FLX as was confirmed by mass spectrometry and NMR. In contrast, incubation of M11 L437E and other mutants with oxacillin (OX, which differs from FLX by a lack of aromatic halogens) resulted in formation of two metabolites. In addition to 5\u2032-hydroxymethyl OX we identified a product resulting from aromatic hydroxylation. In silico studies of both FLX and OX with three CYP BM3 mutants revealed substrate binding poses allowing for 5\u2032-methyl hydroxylation, as well as binding poses with the aromatic moiety in the vicinity of the heme iron for which the corresponding product of aromatic hydroxylation was not observed for FLX. Supported by the (differences in) experimentally determined ratios of product formation for OX hydroxylation by M11 and its L437A variant and M11 L437E, Molecular Dynamics simulations suggest that the preference of mutant M11 L437E to bind FLX in its catalytically active pose over the other binding orientation contributes to its biocatalytic activity, highlighting the benefit of studying effects of active-site mutations on possible alternative enzyme-substrate binding poses in protein engineering."

While bacterial acidification rates, proteolytic activity and the production of exopolysaccharides are known to influence textural properties of fermented milk products, little is known about the role of the microbial surface on microbe-matrix interactions in dairy products. To investigate how alterations of the bacterial cell surface affect fermented milk properties, 25 isogenic Lactococcus lactis strains that differed with respect to surface charge, hydrophobicity, cell chaining, cell-clumping, attachment to milk proteins, pili expression and EPS production were used to produce fermented milk. We show that overexpression of pili increases surface hydrophobicity of various strains from 3-19% to 94-99%. A profound effect of different cell surface properties was an altered spatial distribution of the cells in the fermented product. Aggregated cells tightly fill the cavities of the protein matrix, while chaining cells seem to be localized randomly. A positive correlation was found between pili overexpression and viscosity and gel hardness of fermented milk. Gel hardness also positively correlated with clumping of cells in the fermented milk. Viscosity of fermented milk was also higher when it was produced with cells with a chaining phenotype or with cells that overexpress exopolysaccharides. Our results show that alteration of cell surface morphology affects textural parameters of fermented milk and cell localization in the product. This is indicative of a cell surface-dependent potential of bacterial cells as structure elements in fermented foods."

  "description": "Asymptotic nodal planes in the electron density and the potential in the effective equation for the square root of the densityIt is known that the asymptotic decay (|r|\u2192\u221e) of the electron density n(r) outside a molecule is informative about its first ionization potential I0. It has recently become clear that the special circumstance that the Kohn\u2013Sham (KS) highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) has a nodal plane that extends to infinity may give rise to different cases for the asymptotic behavior of the exact density and of the exact KS potential [P. Gori-Giorgi et al., Mol. Phys. 114, 1086 (2016)]. Here we investigate the consequences of such a HOMO nodal plane for the effective potential in the Schr\u00f6dinger-like equation for the square root of the density, showing that for atoms and molecules it will usually diverge asymptotically on the plane, either exponentially or polynomially, depending on the coupling between Dyson orbitals. We also analyze the issue in the external harmonic potential, reporting an example of an exact analytic density for a fully interacting system that exhibits a different asymptotic behavior on the nodal plane."

  "description": "Effect-based trigger values for in vitro and in vivo bioassays performed on surface water extracts supporting the environmental quality standards (EQS) of the European Water Framework DirectiveEffect-based methods including cell-based bioassays, reporter gene assays and whole-organism assays have been applied for decades in water quality monitoring and testing of enriched solid-phase extracts. There is no common EU-wide agreement on what level of bioassay response in water extracts is acceptable. At present, bioassay results are only benchmarked against each other but not against a consented measure of chemical water quality. The EU environmental quality standards (EQS) differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable surface water concentrations for individual chemicals but cannot capture the thousands of chemicals in water and their biological action as mixtures. We developed a method that reads across from existing EQS and includes additional mixture considerations with the goal that the derived effect-based trigger values (EBT) indicate acceptable risk for complex mixtures as they occur in surface water. Advantages and limitations of various approaches to read across from EQS are discussed and distilled to an algorithm that translates EQS into their corresponding bioanalytical equivalent concentrations (BEQ). The proposed EBT derivation method was applied to 48 in vitro bioassays with 32 of them having sufficient information to yield preliminary EBTs. To assess the practicability and robustness of the proposed approach, we compared the tentative EBTs with observed environmental effects. The proposed method only gives guidance on how to derive EBTs but does not propose final EBTs for implementation. The EBTs for some bioassays such as those for estrogenicity are already mature and could be implemented into regulation in the near future, while for others it will still take a few iterations until we can be confident of the power of the proposed EBTs to differentiate good from poor water quality with respect to chemical contamination."

The fluorescent reagent (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate was employed as chiral amino acid derivatizing agent and sodium dodecyl sulfate served as pseudo-stationary phase for separating the formed amino acid diastereomers. Sensitive analysis of (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate-amino acids was achieved applying a xenon-mercury lamp for ultraviolet excitation, and a spectrograph and charge-coupled device for wavelength-resolved emission detection. Applying signal integration over a 30 nm emission wavelength interval, signal-to-noise ratios for derivatized amino acids were up to 23 times higher as obtained using a standard photomultiplier for detection. The background electrolyte composition (electrolyte, pH, sodium dodecyl sulfate concentration, and organic solvent) was studied in order to attain optimal chemo- and enantioseparation. Enantioseparation of 12 proteinogenic dl-amino acids was achieved with chiral resolutions between 1.2 and 7.9, and detection limits for most derivatized amino acids in the 13\u201360nM range (injected concentration). Linearity (coefficients of determination>0.985) and peak-area and migration-time repeatabilities (relative standard deviations lower than 2.6 and 1.9%, respectively) were satisfactory. The employed fluorescence detection system provided up to 100-times better signal-to-noise ratios for (+)-1-(9-fluorenyl)ethyl chloroformate-amino acids than ultraviolet absorbance detection, showing good potential for d-amino acid analysis."

  "description": "Fast microplastics identification with stimulated Raman scattering microscopyThe abundance of plastic products in modern society has resulted in a proliferation of small plastic particles called \"microplastics\" in the global environment. Currently, spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared and spontaneous (i.e., conventional) Raman spectroscopy are widely employed for the identification of the plastic microparticles, but these are rather time consuming. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, based on the coherent interaction of 2 different laser beams with vibrational levels in the molecules of the sample, would enable much faster detection and identification of microplastics. Here, we present for the first time an SRS-based method for identifying 5 different high production-volume polymer types in microplastics extracted from environmental or consumer product samples. The particles from the extracts were collected on a flat alumina filter, and 6 SRS images were acquired at specifically chosen wavenumbers. Next, we decomposed these spectral data into specific images for the 5 polymers selected for calibration. We tested the approach on an artificial mixture of plastic particles and determined the signal-to-noise and level of cross talk for the 5 polymer types. As a proof of principle, we identified polyethylene terephthalate particles extracted from a commercial personal care product, demonstrating also the thousand-fold higher speed of mapping with SRS compared with conventional Raman. Furthermore, after density separation of a Rhine estuary sediment sample, we scanned 1 cm2 of the filter surface in less than 5 hr and detected and identified 88 microplastics, which corresponds to 12,000 particles per kilogram dry weight. We conclude that SRS can be an efficient method for monitoring microplastics in the environment and potentially many other matrices of interest."

  "description": "High-resolution glycoform profiling of intact therapeutic proteins by hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometryGlycosylation is considered a critical quality attribute of therapeutic proteins. Protein heterogeneity introduced by glycosylation includes differences in the nature, number and position of the glycans. Whereas analysis of released glycans and glycopeptides provides information about the composition and/or position of the glycan, intact glycoprotein analysis allows assignment of individual proteoforms and co-occurring modifications. Yet, resolving protein glycoforms at the intact level is challenging. We have explored the capacity of hydrophilic liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) for assessing glycosylation patterns of intact pharmaceutical proteins by analyzing the complex glycoproteins interferon-beta-1a (rhIFN-\u03b2 \u2212 1a) and recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO). Efficient glycoform separation was achieved using a superficially-porous amide HILIC stationary phase and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as eluent additive. In-source collision-induced dissociation proved to be very useful to minimize protein-signal suppression effects by TFA. Direct injection of therapeutic proteins in aqueous formulation was possible without causing extra band dispersion, provided that the sample injection volume was not larger than 2 \u03bcL. HILIC-MS of rhIFN-\u03b2 \u2212 1a and rhEPO allowed the assignment of, respectively, 15 and 51 glycoform compositions, next to a variety of posttranslational modifications, such as succinimide, oxidation and N-terminal methionine-loss products. MS-based assignments showed that neutral glycan units significantly contributed to glycoform separation, whereas terminal sialic acids only had a marginal effect on HILIC retention. Comparisons of HILIC-MS with the selectivity provided by capillary electrophoresis-MS for the same glycoproteins, revealed a remarkable complementarity of the techniques. Finally it was demonstrated that by replacing TFA for difluoroacetic acid, peak resolution somewhat decreased, but rhEPO glycoforms with relative abundances below 1% could be detected by HILIC-MS, increasing the overall rhEPO glycoform coverage to 72."

We investigated how D. hafniense Y51 confronts the debilitating limitations of not having enough electron donor (lactate), or electron acceptor (fumarate) during cultivation in chemostats. The residual concentrations of the substrates supplied in excess were much lower than expected. Transcriptomics, proteomics and fluxomics were integrated to investigate how this phenomenon was regulated. Through diverse regulation at both transcriptional and translational levels, strain Y51 turned to fermenting the excess lactate and disproportionating the excess fumarate under fumarate- and lactate-limiting conditions respectively. Genes and proteins related to the utilization of a variety of alternative electron donors and acceptors absent from the medium were induced, apparently involving the Wood\u2013Ljungdahl pathway. Through this metabolic flexibility, D. hafniense Y51 may be able to switch between different metabolic capabilities under limiting conditions."

  "description": "Modelling, singular perturbation and bifurcation analyses of bitrophic food chainsTwo predator-prey model formulations are studied: the classical Rosenzweig\u2013MacArthur (RM) model and the Mass Balance (MB) chemostat model. When the growth and loss rate of the predator is much smaller than that of the prey these models are slow\u2013fast systems leading mathematically to a singular perturbation problem. In contradiction to the RM-model, the resource for the prey is modelled explicitly in the MB-model but this comes with additional parameters. These parameter values are chosen such that the two models become easy to compare. In both models the transcritical bifurcation, a threshold above which invasion of predator into prey-only system occurs, and the Hopf bifurcation where the interior equilibrium becomes unstable leading to a stable limit cycle occur. The slow-fast limit cycles are called relaxation oscillations which for increasing differences in time scales leads to the well known degenerated trajectories being concatenations of slow parts of the trajectory and fast parts of the trajectory. In the fast\u2013slow version of the RM-model a canard explosion of the stable limit cycles occurs in the oscillatory region of the parameter space. To our knowledge this type of dynamics has not been observed for the RM-model and not even for more complex ecosystem models. When a bifurcation parameter crosses the Hopf bifurcation point the amplitude of the emerging stable limit cycles increases. However, depending of the perturbation parameter the shape of this limit cycle changes abruptly from one consisting of two concatenated slow and fast episodes with small amplitude of the limit cycle, to a shape with large amplitude of which the shape is similar to the relaxation oscillation, the well known degenerated phase trajectories consisting of four episodes (concatenation of two slow and two fast). The canard explosion point is accurately predicted by using an extended asymptotic expansion technique in the perturbation and bifurcation parameter simultaneously where the small amplitude stable limit cycles exist. The predicted dynamics of the MB-model is in a large part of the parameter space similar to that of the RM-model. However, the fast\u2013slow version of MB-model does not predict a canard explosion phenomenon."

Educational programmes seem to be lagging behind this development. At the same time, there is a growing need not only for strong data science skills, but foremost for the ability to both translate between tools and methods on the one hand, and application and problems on the other. Results: Here we present our experiences with shaping and running a masters? programme in bioinformatics and systems biology in Amsterdam. From this, we have developed a comprehensive philosophy on how translation in training may be achieved in a dynamic and multidisciplinary research area, which is described here. We furthermore describe two requirements that enable translation, which we have found to be crucial: sufficient depth and focus on multidisciplinary topic areas, coupled with a balanced breadth from adjacent disciplines. Finally, we present concrete suggestions on how this may be implemented in practice, which may be relevant for the effectiveness of life science and data science curricula in general, and of particular interest to those who are in the process of setting up such curricula."

  "description": "NMR 1H-Shielding Constants of Hydrogen-Bond Donor Reflect Manifestation of the Pauli PrincipleNMR spectroscopy is one of the most useful methods for detection and characterization of hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions in biological systems. For H bonds X-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Y, where X and Y are O or N, it is generally believed that a decrease in 1H-shielding constants relates to a shortening of H-bond donor-acceptor distance. Here we investigated computationally the trend of 1H-shielding constants for hydrogen-bonded protons in a series of guanine C8-substituted GC pair model compounds as a function of the molecular structure. Furthermore, the electron density distribution around the hydrogen atom was analyzed with the Voronoi deformation density (VDD) method. Our findings demonstrate that 1H-shielding values of the hydrogen bond are determined by the depletion of charge around the hydrogen atom, which stems from the fact that electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle."

  "description": "Is structural sensitivity a problem of oversimplified biological models? Insights from nested Dynamic Energy Budget modelsMany current issues in ecology require predictions made by mathematical models, which are built on somewhat arbitrary choices. Their consequences are quantified by sensitivity analysis to quantify how changes in model parameters propagate into an uncertainty in model predictions. An extension called structural sensitivity analysis deals with changes in the mathematical description of complex processes like predation. Such processes are described at the population scale by a specific mathematical function taken among similar ones, a choice that can strongly drive model predictions. However, it has only been studied in simple theoretical models. Here, we ask whether structural sensitivity is a problem of oversimplified models. We found in predator\u2013prey models describing chemostat experiments that these models are less structurally sensitive to the choice of a specific functional response if they include mass balance resource dynamics and individual maintenance. Neglecting these processes in an ecological model (for instance by using the well-known logistic growth equation) is not only an inappropriate description of the ecological system, but also a source of more uncertain predictions."

  "description": "Advanced Good Cell Culture Practice for human primary, stem cell-derived and organoid models as well as microphysiological systemsA major reason for the current reproducibility crisis in the life sciences is the poor implementation of quality control measures and reporting standards. Improvement is needed, especially regarding increasingly complex in vitro methods. Good Cell Culture Practice (GCCP) was an effort from 1996 to 2005 to develop such minimum quality standards also applicable in academia. This paper summarizes recent key developments in in vitro cell culture and addresses the issues resulting for GCCP, e.g. the development of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and gene-edited cells. It further deals with human stem-cell-derived models and bioengineering of organo-typic cell cultures, including organoids, organ-on-chip and human-on-chip approaches. Commercial vendors and cell banks have made human primary cells more widely available over the last decade, increasing their use, but also requiring specific guidance as to GCCP. The characterization of cell culture systems including high-content imaging and high-throughput measurement technologies increasingly combined with more complex cell and tissue cultures represent a further challenge for GCCP. The increasing use of gene editing techniques to generate and modify in vitro culture models also requires discussion of its impact on GCCP. International (often varying) legislations and market forces originating from the commercialization of cell and tissue products and technologies are further impacting on the need for the use of GCCP. This report summarizes the recommendations of the second of two workshops, held in Germany in December 2015, aiming map the challenge and organize the process or developing a revised GCCP 2.0."

Computed data evidence that the most stable host-guest bonding occurs in ruthenium complexed hosts, followed by technetium and molybdenum metalated macrocyclic receptors. Furthermore, the guest's steric fit in the host scaffold is a selective and crucial criterion to the anion recognition. Our analyses reveal that coordinated charged metals provide a larger electrostatic stabilization to anion recognition, shifting the calixarenes cavity toward an electron deficient acidic character. This study contributes to the design and development of new organometallic macrocyclic hosts with increased anion recognition specificity."

In this work, the decomposition results obtained by these schemes were compared for more than 200 hydrogen-, halogen-, and pnicogen-bonded, dispersion-bound, and mixed complexes to investigate their similarity in the evaluation of the nature of noncovalent interactions. BLYP functional with D3(BJ) correction was used for the EDA scheme, whereas asymptotically corrected PBE0 functional for DFT-SAPT provided some of the best combinations for description of noncovalent interactions. Both schemes provide similar results concerning total interaction energies and insight into the individual energy components. For most complexes, the dominant energetic term was identified equally by both decomposition schemes. Because the canonical EDA is computationally less demanding than the DFT-SAPT, the former can be especially used in cases where the systems investigated are very large."

Several studies have recently suggested that BDQ ultimately causes mycobacterial cell death through a phenomenon known as uncoupling. The biochemical basis underlying this, in BDQ, is unresolved and may represent a new pathway to the development of effective therapeutics. In this communication, we demonstrate that BDQ can inhibit ATP synthesis in Escherichia coli by functioning as a H+/K+ ionophore, causing transmembrane pH and potassium gradients to be equilibrated. Despite the apparent lack of a BDQ-binding site, incorporating the E. coli Fo subunit into liposomes enhanced the ionophoric activity of BDQ. We discuss the possibility that localization of BDQ at F1Fo-ATP synthases enables BDQ to create an uncoupled microenvironment, by antiport-ing H+/K+. Ionophoric properties may be desirable in high-affinity antimicrobials targeting integral membrane proteins."

  "description": "Lactobacillus rhamnosus probiotic food as a tool for empowerment across the value chain in AfricaPerhaps by serendipity, but Lactobacillus rhamnosus has emerged from the 1980s as the most researched probiotic species. The many attributes of the two main probiotic strains of the species, L. rhamnosus GG and GR-1, have made them suitable for applications to developing countries in Africa and beyond. Their use with a Streptococcus thermophilus starter strain C106, in the fermentation of milk, millet, and juices has provided a means to reach over 250,000 consumers of the first probiotic food on the continent. The social and economical implications for this translational research are significant, and especially pertinent for people living in poverty, with malnutrition and exposure to environmental toxins and infectious diseases including HIV and malaria. This example of probiotic applications illustrates the power of microbes in positively impacting the lives of women, men, and children, right across the food value chain."

  "description": "Enhancing detectability of anabolic-steroid residues in bovine urine by actively modulated online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography \u2013 high-resolution mass spectrometryIn this study we describe an approach to enhance the sensitivity of an online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC \u00d7 LC) high-resolution mass spectrometry method for the separation and detection of trace levels of anabolic-steroid residues in complex urine matrices. Compared to one-dimensional liquid chromatography (1D-LC), LC \u00d7 LC methods offer higher separation power, thanks to the combined effect of two different selectivities and a higher peak capacity. However, when using state-of-the-art LC \u00d7 LC instrumentation, the price paid for the increase in separation power is a decrease in sensitivity and detectability of trace-level analytes. This can be ascribed to the sample dilution that takes place during each of the two chromatographic steps. The way in which fractions are collected and transferred from the first to the second column is also of paramount importance, especially the volume and the solvent composition of the fractions injected in the second column. To overcome the detection limitation, we present an active-modulation strategy, based on concentrating the fractions of the first-dimension effluent using a modulation interface that employs trap columns. We obtained a signal enhancement for anabolic-steroid compounds in a bovine-urine sample by a factor of 2.4\u20137.6 and an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio up to a factor of 7 in comparison with a standard loop-based modulation interface. In addition, thanks to the increased sensitivity of our method, a substantially larger number of peaks were detected (76 vs. 36). Moreover, we could reduce the solvent consumption by a factor of three (160 mL vs. 500 mL per run)."

  "description": "High-performance liquid chromatography-based assay for glutathione transferase theta 2 activity: Application to characterize interindividual variability in human liver fractionsHuman glutathione transferase T2-2 (GSTT2-2) is one of the enzymes considered to play a role in inactivation of toxicants and carcinogens. The expression level of this enzyme is determined by genetic and environmental factors, which may lead to differences in susceptibility. As a specific assay for GSTT2-2 so far a spectroscopical assay based on GSH-conjugation of menaphthyl sulfate (MSu) was used. This spectrophotometric assay, however, appeared too insensitive to accurately quantify the GSTT2-2 activities in a panel of 20 human liver samples. More recently, expression levels of GSTT2-2 in biological samples are quantified by measuring mRNA levels. Since mRNA-levels do not always correlate well with enzyme activity, a specific and sensitive assay is required. In the present study a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-based method was developed. By applying the new method, firstly, the specificity of GSTT2-2 among 15 recombinant human GST isoforms in catalyzing GSH-conjugation of MSu was confirmed. In addition, a 65-fold inter-individual variation of GSTT2-2 activity was found from the individual liver fractions. By applying the method to individual liver fractions, a 65-fold inter-individual variation of GSTT2-2 activity was found. As a second application, the role of GSTT2-2 in GSH-conjugation of the environmental carcinogen 1-methylpyrene sulfate (MPS) was studied by correlation analysis with GSTT2-2-catalyzed MSu conjugation. The relatively poor correlation suggested that other GSTs also contribute to MPS-conjugation, as confirmed by incubations with recombinant GSTs."

Besides exploring reactivity trends and comparing them to aliphatic C-X activation, we aim at uncovering the physical factors behind the activity and selectivity. Our results show that barriers for arylic C-X activation are lower than those for the corresponding aliphatic C-X bonds. However, trends along bonds or upon variation of ligands are similar. Thus, bond activation barriers increase along C-Cl < C-H < C-C and along Pd < Pd(PH3) or Pd(PH2C2H4PH2) < Pd(PH3)2. Activation strain analyses in conjunction with quantitative molecular orbital theory trace these trends to the rigidity and bonding capability of the various C-X bonds, model catalysts, and ligands."

The aliphatic and aromatic dichalcogenides have been chosen in light of their activity in glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like catalytic cycles and their promising features as efficient antioxidant compounds. The reaction products, the energetics and the mechanistic details of these oxidations are discussed. Analogous disulfides are included in our analysis for completeness. We find that the barrier for oxidation of dichalcogenides decreases from disulfides to diselenides to ditellurides. On the other hand, variation of the substituents at the chalcogen nucleus has relatively little effect on the reactivity."

  "description": "Noelin1 Affects Lateral Mobility of Synaptic AMPA ReceptorsLateral diffusion on the neuronal plasma membrane of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) serves an important role in synaptic plasticity. We investigated the role of the secreted glycoprotein Noelin1 (Olfactomedin-1 or Pancortin) in AMPAR lateral mobility and its dependence on the extracellular matrix (ECM). We found that Noelin1 interacts with the AMPAR with high affinity, however, without affecting rise- and decay time and desensitization properties. Noelin1 co-localizes with synaptic and extra-synaptic AMPARs and is expressed at synapses in an activity-dependent manner. Single-particle tracking shows that Noelin1 reduces lateral mobility of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GluA1-containing receptors and affects short-term plasticity. While the ECM does not constrain the synaptic pool of AMPARs and acts only extrasynaptically, Noelin1 contributes to synaptic potentiation by limiting AMPAR mobility at synaptic sites. This is the first evidence for the role of a secreted AMPAR-interacting protein on mobility of GluA1-containing receptors and synaptic plasticity. Pandya et al. find that the secreted protein Noelin1 binds AMPA-type glutamate receptors with high affinity. They show a role in limiting receptor mobility and keeping receptors at synaptic sites in a subunit-specific way. This is the first evidence for a secreted auxiliary subunit in mobility and plasticity of glutamate receptors."

  "description": "Inhibition of autotransporter biogenesis by small moleculesDisarming pathogens by targeting virulence factors is a promising alternative to classic antibiotics. Many virulence factors in Gram-negative bacteria are secreted via the autotransporter (AT) pathway, also known as Type 5 secretion. These factors are secreted with the assistance of two membrane-based protein complexes: Sec and Bam. To identify inhibitors of the AT pathway, we used transcriptomics analysis to develop a fluorescence-based high-throughput assay that reports on the stress induced by the model AT hemoglobin protease (Hbp) when its secretion across the outer membrane is inhibited. Screening a library of 1600 fragments yielded the compound VUF15259 that provokes cell envelope stress and secretion inhibition of the ATs Hbp and Antigen-43. VUF15259 also impairs \u03b2-barrel folding activity of various outer membrane proteins. Furthermore, we found that mutants that are compromised in outer membrane protein biogenesis are more susceptible to VUF15259. Finally, VUF15259 induces the release of vesicles that appear to assemble in short chains. Taken together, VUF15259 is the first reported compound that inhibits AT secretion and our data are mostly consistent with VUF15259 interfering with the Bam-complex as potential mode of action. The validation of the presented assay incites its use to screen larger compound libraries with drug-like compounds."

  "description": "Protein export into and across the atypical diderm cell envelope of mycobacteriaMycobacteria, including the infamous pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are high-GC Gram-positive bacteria with a distinctive cell envelope. Although there is a typical inner membrane, the mycobacterial cell envelope is unusual in having its peptidoglycan layer connected to a polymer of arabinogalactan, which in turn is covalently attached to long-chain mycolic acids that help form a highly impermeable mycobacterial outermembrane. This complex double-membrane, or diderm, cell envelope imparts mycobacteria with unique requirements for protein export into and across the cell envelope for secretion into the extracellular environment. In this article, we review the four protein export pathways known to exist in mycobacteria: two conserved systems that exist in all types of bacteria (the Sec and Tat pathways) and two specialized systems that exist in mycobacteria, corynebacteria, and a subset of low-GC Gram-positive bacteria (the SecA2 and type VII secretion pathways). We describe the progress made over the past 15 years in understanding each of these mycobacterial export pathways, and we highlight the need for research to understand the specific steps of protein export across the mycobacterial outer membrane."

  "description": "Special Collection: Computational ChemistryChemists know well the value of an experimental or a theoretical result, but what is the value of a computational result? Simulation is neither theory nor experience, nor a mere calculation tool, but a genuine way of approaching reality that is transforming the scientific method. In some cases, it offers explanations to observations or experiments that seem incomprehensible because they are too complex. In this case, the computation serves as a relief. An experiment that converges with a certain computation has more scientific value than an experiment that does not converge with anything at all. In other cases, contribution of computational chemistry is essential because there is no experimental manner to determine what happens during a chemical process; for instance, in the path from reactants to products in (fast) reactions. Now, computational chemistry provides additional information that is not possible to obtain from experiments, so it is a valuable complement to them. Indeed, fruitful synergy between computation and experiment has led to the approach of theory-driven experimentation. Finally, computational chemistry helps to legitimize models or theories that have little opportunity to be contrasted with reality. In this situation, computational chemistry is not experience, but it does substitute it in relation to theory. In the present special collection, we have examples of the different ways computational chemistry helps chemists to interpret the electronic and molecular structure of molecules and their reactivity."

  "description": "Transcriptional response of Lactococcus lactis during bacterial emulsificationMicrobial surface properties are important for interactions with the environment in which cells reside. Surface properties of lactic acid bacteria significantly vary and some strains can form strong emulsions when mixed with a hydrocarbon. Lactococcus lactis NCDO712 forms oil-in-water emulsions upon mixing of a cell suspension with petroleum. In the emulsion the bacteria locate at the oil-water interphase which is consistent with Pickering stabilization. Cells of strain NCDO712 mixed with sunflower seed oil did not stabilize the oil droplets. This study shows that the addition of either ethanol or ammonium sulfate led to cell aggregation, which subsequently allowed stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. From this, we conclude that bacterial cell aggregation is important for emulsion droplet stabilization. To determine how bacterial emulsification influences the microbial transcriptome RNAseq analysis was performed on lactococci taken from the oil-water interphase. In comparison to cells in suspension 72 genes were significantly differentially expressed with a more than 4-fold difference. The majority of these genes encode proteins involved in transport processes and the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and ions. Especially the proportion of genes belonging to the CodY regulon was high. Our results also point out that in a complex environment such as food fermentations a heterogeneous response of microbes might be caused by microbe-matrix interactions. In addition, microdroplet technologies are increasingly used in research. The understanding of interactions between bacterial cells and oil-water interphases is of importance for conducting and interpreting such experiments."

  "description": "Dynamic Metabolic Rewiring Enables Efficient Acetyl Coenzyme A Assimilation in Paracoccus denitrificansDuring growth, microorganisms have to balance metabolic flux between energy and biosynthesis. One of the key intermediates in central carbon metabolism is acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which can be either oxidized in the citric acid cycle or assimilated into biomass through dedicated pathways. Two acetyl-CoA assimilation strategies in bacteria have been described so far, the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP) and the glyoxylate cycle (GC). Here, we show that Paracoccus denitrificans uses both strategies for acetyl-CoA assimilation during different growth stages, revealing an unexpected metabolic complexity in the organism's central carbon metabolism. The EMCP is constitutively expressed on various substrates and leads to high biomass yields on substrates requiring acetyl-CoA assimilation, such as acetate, while the GC is specifically induced on these substrates, enabling high growth rates. Even though each acetyl-CoA assimilation strategy alone confers a distinct growth advantage, P. denitrificans recruits both to adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as a switch from succinate to acetate. Time-resolved single-cell experiments show that during this switch, expression of the EMCP and GC is highly coordinated, indicating fine-tuned genetic programming. The dynamic metabolic rewiring of acetyl-CoA assimilation is an evolutionary innovation by P. denitrificans that allows this organism to respond in a highly flexible manner to changes in the nature and availability of the carbon source to meet the physiological needs of the cell, representing a new phenomenon in central carbon metabolism.IMPORTANCE Central carbon metabolism provides organisms with energy and cellular building blocks during growth and is considered the invariable \"operating system\" of the cell. Here, we describe a new phenomenon in bacterial central carbon metabolism. In contrast to many other bacteria that employ only one pathway for the conversion of the central metabolite acetyl-CoA, Paracoccus denitrificans possesses two different acetyl-CoA assimilation pathways. These two pathways are dynamically recruited during different stages of growth, which allows P. denitrificans to achieve both high biomass yield and high growth rates under changing environmental conditions. Overall, this dynamic rewiring of central carbon metabolism in P. denitrificans represents a new strategy compared to those of other organisms employing only one acetyl-CoA assimilation pathway."

  "description": "Taming conformational heterogeneity in and with vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopyThe flexibility of a molecule has important consequences on its function and application. Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) is intrinsically an excellent experimental technique to get a hold on this flexibility as it is highly sensitive to key conformational details and able to distinguish rapidly interconverting conformers. One of the major challenges in analyzing the spectra by comparison to theoretical predictions is the uncertainty in the computed energies of the multitude of conformations. This uncertainty also affects the reliability of the stereochemical assignment it is normally used for. We present here a novel approach that explicitly takes the energy uncertainties into account in a genetic algorithm based method that fits calculated to the experimental spectra. We show that this approach leads to significant improvements over previously used methodologies. Importantly, statistical validation studies provide quantitative measures for the reliability of relevant parameters used such as the energy uncertainty and the extent to which conformational heterogeneity can be determined. Similarly, quantitative measures can be obtained for the possibility that the flexibility that is introduced in the fit might lead to an incorrect assignment of the stereochemistry. These results break new ground for different techniques based on VCD to elucidate conformational flexibility."

These features rationalize abandoning, in the common DMFT practice, prohibitively complicated generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs). Specifically, it is shown that the exact PF and EF coincide on the set of the v-representable first-order reduced density matrices (1RDMs), while FFFs approximate the common PF and EF for such 1RDMs. It is revealed that for some types of FFFs, for example for the geminal-based approximations, the GPCs are essentially trivialized to the pairwise natural occupation numbers (NONs) degeneracy conditions, routinely imposed for closed-shell systems."

However, systematic annotation of synaptic genes and ontology of synaptic processes are currently lacking. We established SynGO, an interactive knowledge base that accumulates available research about synapse biology using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to novel ontology terms: 87 synaptic locations and 179 synaptic processes. SynGO annotations are exclusively based on published, expert-curated evidence. Using 2,922 annotations for 1,112 genes, we show that synaptic genes are exceptionally well conserved and less tolerant to mutations than other genes. Many SynGO terms are significantly overrepresented among gene variations associated with intelligence, educational attainment, ADHD, autism, and bipolar disorder and among de novo variants associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia. SynGO is a public, universal reference for synapse research and an online analysis platform for interpretation of large-scale -omics data (https://syngoportal.org and http://geneontology.org). The SynGO consortium presents a framework to annotate synaptic protein locations and functions and annotations for 1,112 synaptic genes based on published experimental evidence. SynGO reports exceptional features and disease associations for synaptic genes and provides an online data analysis platform."

  "description": "High accuracy theoretical investigations of CaF, SrF, and BaF and implications for laser-coolingThe NL-eEDM collaboration is building an experimental setup to search for the permanent electric dipole moment of the electron in a slow beam of cold barium fluoride molecules [NL-eEDM Collaboration, Eur. Phys. J. D 72, 197 (2018)]. Knowledge of the molecular properties of BaF is thus needed to plan the measurements and, in particular, to determine the optimal laser-cooling scheme. Accurate and reliable theoretical predictions of these properties require the incorporation of both high-order correlation and relativistic effects in the calculations. In this work, theoretical investigations of the ground and lowest excited states of BaF and its lighter homologs, CaF and SrF, are carried out in the framework of the relativistic Fock-space coupled cluster and multireference configuration interaction methods. Using the calculated molecular properties, we determine the Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) for the A2\u03a01/2\u2192X2\u03c21/2+ transition, which was successfully used for cooling CaF and SrF and is now considered for BaF. For all three species, the FCFs are found to be highly diagonal. Calculations are also performed for the B2\u03c21/2+\u2192X2\u03c21/2+ transition recently exploited for laser-cooling of CaF; it is shown that this transition is not suitable for laser-cooling of BaF, due to the nondiagonal nature of the FCFs in this system. Special attention is given to the properties of the A\u20322\u0394state, which in the case of BaF causes a leak channel, in contrast to CaF and SrF species where this state is energetically above the excited states used in laser-cooling. We also present the dipole moments of the ground and excited states of the three molecules and the transition dipole moments (TDMs) between the different states. Finally, using the calculated FCFs and TDMs, we determine that the A2\u03a01/2\u2192X2\u03c21/2+ transition is suitable for transverse cooling in BaF."

The computations were guided by an integrated activation-strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analysis. It is revealed why both [5]metacyclophane and [5]paracyclophane exhibit a significant rate enhancement compared to their planar benzene analogue. The activation strain analyses revealed that the enhanced reactivity originates from 1) predistortion of the aromatic core resulting in a reduced activation strain of the aromatic diene, and/or 2) enhanced interaction with the dienophile through a distortion-controlled lowering of the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap within the diene. Both of these physical mechanisms and thus the rate of Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition can be tuned through different modes of geometrical distortion (meta versus para bridging) and by heteroatom substitution in the aromatic ring. Judicious choice of the bridge and heteroatom in the aromatic core enables effective tuning of the aromatic Diels\u2013Alder reactivity to achieve activation barriers as low as 2 kcal mol\u22121, which is an impressive 35 kcal mol\u22121 lower than that of benzene."

We show that both rupatadine (1) and desloratadine (2) have a long residence time at the histamine H1 receptor (H1R). Through development of a [3H]levocetirizine radiolabel, we find that the residence time of 1 exceeds that of 2 more than 10-fold. This was further explored with 22 synthesized rupatadine and desloratadine analogues. Methylene-linked cycloaliphatic or \u03b2-branched substitutions of desloratadine increase the residence time at the H1R, conveying a longer duration of receptor antagonism. However, cycloaliphatic substituents directly attached to the piperidine amine (i.e., lacking the spacer) have decreased binding affinity and residence time compared to their methylene-linked structural analogues. Guided by docking studies, steric constraints within the binding pocket are hypothesized to explain the observed differences in affinity and binding kinetics between analogues."

  "description": "A decoy-receptor approach using nicotinic acetylcholine receptor mimics reveals their potential as novel therapeutics against neurotoxic snakebiteSnakebite is a neglected tropical disease that causes 138,000 deaths each year. Neurotoxic snake venoms contain small neurotoxins, including three-finger toxins (3FTxs), which can cause rapid paralysis in snakebite victims by blocking postsynaptic transmission via nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). These toxins are typically weakly immunogenic and thus are often not effectively targeted by current polyclonal antivenom therapies. We investigated whether nAChR mimics, also known as acetylcholine binding proteins (AChBPs), could effectively capture 3FTxs and therefore be developed as a novel class of snake-generic therapeutics for combatting neurotoxic envenoming. First, we identified the binding specificities of 3FTx from various medically important elapid snake venoms to nAChR using two recombinant nAChR mimics: the AChBP from Lymnaea stagnalis and a humanized neuronal \u03b17 version (\u03b17-AChBP). We next characterized these AChBP-bound and unbound fractions using SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. Interestingly, both mimics effectively captured long-chain 3FTxs from multiple snake species but largely failed to capture the highly related short-chain 3FTxs, suggesting a high level of binding specificity. We next investigated whether nAChR mimics could be used as snakebite therapeutics. We showed that while \u03b17-AChBP alone did not protect against Naja haje (Egyptian cobra) venom lethality in vivo, it significantly prolonged survival times when coadministered with a nonprotective dose of antivenom. Thus, nAChR mimics are capable of neutralizing specific venom toxins and may be useful adjunct therapeutics for improving the safety and affordability of existing snakebite treatments by reducing therapeutic doses. Our findings justify exploring the future development of AChBPs as potential snakebite treatments."

P-containing silicate 14 with bidentate triphenylphosphane, biphenyl, and Me ligands is subject to multiple Berry pseudorotations, turnstile rotations, and conformational flexibility of the P-center. The stability increased by masking the P-center with a BH3 group (16). DFT and NMR modeling reveal two isoenergetic conformers for 16 with a barrier of ca. 19 kcal\u2027mol\u20131 for a complex interconversion pathway.

  "description": "Acetylene containing cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Tyr)-analogs as mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP121A1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosisTuberculosis (TB) is a globally significant infective disease that is caused by a single infectious agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Because of the rise in the number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB strains, identification of alternative drug targets for the development of drugs with different mechanism of actions is desired. CYP121A1, one of the twenty cytochrome P450 enzymes encoded in the Mtb genome, was previously shown to be essential for bacterial growth. This enzyme catalyzes the intramolecular C\u2013C crosslinking reaction of the cyclopeptide cyclo(L-tyr-L-tyr) (cYY) yielding the metabolite mycocyclosin. In the present study, acetylene-substituted cYY-analogs were synthesized and evaluated as potential mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP121A1. The acetylene-substituted cYY-analogs were capable of binding to CYP121A1 with affinities comparable with cYY, and exhibited a Type I binding mode, indicative of a substrate-like binding, mandatory for metabolism. Only the cYY-analogs which contain an acetylene-substitution at one (2a) or both (3) para-positions of cYY showed mechanism-based inhibition of CYP121A1 activity. The values of KI and kinact were 236 \u00b5M and 0.045 min\u22121, respectively, for compound 2a, and 145 \u00b5M and 0.015 min\u22121, repectively, for compound 3 The inactivation could neither be reversed by dialysis nor be prevented by including glutathione. LC-MS analysis demonstrated that the inactivation results from covalent binding to the apoprotein, whereas the heme was unmodified. Interestingly, the mass increment of the CYP121A1 apoprotein was significantly smaller than was expected from the ketene formed by oxidation of the acetylene-group, indicative for a secondary cleavage reaction in the active site of CYP121A1. Although the two acetylene-containing cYY-analogs showed significant mechanism-based inhibition, growth inhibition of the Mtb strains was only observed at millimolar concentrations. This low efficacy may be due to insufficient irreversible inactivation of CYP121A1 and/or insufficient cellular uptake. Although the identified mechanism-based inhibitors have no perspective for Mtb-treatment, this study is the first proof-of-principle that mechanism-based inhibition of CYP121A1 is feasible and may provide the basis for new strategies in the design and development of compounds against this promising therapeutic target."

  "description": "A dual attack on the peroxide bond. The common principle of peroxidatic cysteine or selenocysteine residuesThe (seleno)cysteine residues in some protein families react with hydroperoxides with rate constants far beyond those of fully dissociated low molecular weight thiol or selenol compounds. In case of the glutathione peroxidases, we could demonstrate that high rate constants are achieved by a proton transfer from the chalcogenol to a residue of the active site [Orian et al. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 87 (2015)]. We extended this study to three more protein families (OxyR, GAPDH and Prx). According to DFT calculations, a proton transfer from the active site chalcogenol to a residue within the active site is a prerequisite for both, creating a chalcogenolate that attacks one oxygen of the hydroperoxide substrate and combining the delocalized proton with the remaining OH or OR, respectively, to create an ideal leaving group. The \u201cparking postions\u201d of the delocalized proton differ between the protein families. It is the ring nitrogen of tryptophan in GPx, a histidine in GAPDH and OxyR and a threonine in Prx. The basic principle, however, is common to all four families of proteins. We, thus, conclude that the principle outlined in this investigation offers a convincing explanation for how a cysteine residue can become peroxidatic."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity: how to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

  "description": "Species-specific secretion of ESX-5 type VII substrates is determined by the linker 2 of EccC5Mycobacteria use type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) to translocate a wide range of proteins across their diderm cell envelope. These systems, also called ESX systems, are crucial for the viability and/or virulence of mycobacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the fish pathogen Mycobacterium marinum. We have previously shown that the M. tuberculosis ESX-5 system is unable to fully complement secretion in an M. marinum esx-5 mutant, suggesting species specificity in secretion. In this study, we elaborated on this observation and established that the membrane ATPase EccC5, possessing four (putative) nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), is responsible for this. By creating M. marinum-M. tuberculosis EccC5 chimeras, we observed both in M. marinum and in M. tuberculosis that secretion specificity of PE_PGRS proteins depends on the presence of the cognate linker 2 domain of EccC5. This region connects NBD1 and NBD2 of EccC5 and is responsible for keeping NBD1 in an inhibited state. Notably, the ESX-5 substrate EsxN, predicted to bind to NBD3 on EccC5, showed a distinct secretion profile. These results indicate that linker 2 is involved in species-specific substrate recognition and might therefore be an additional substrate recognition site of EccC5."

  "description": "The EU-ToxRisk method documentation, data processing and chemical testing pipeline for the regulatory use of new approach methodsHazard assessment, based on new approach methods (NAM), requires the use of batteries of assays, where individual tests may be contributed by different laboratories. A unified strategy for such collaborative testing is presented. It details all procedures required to allow test information to be usable for integrated hazard assessment, strategic project decisions and/or for regulatory purposes. The EU-ToxRisk project developed a strategy to provide regulatorily valid data, and exemplified this using a panel of\u2009>\u200920 assays (with\u2009>\u200950 individual endpoints), each exposed to 19 well-known test compounds (e.g. rotenone, colchicine, mercury, paracetamol, rifampicine, paraquat, taxol). Examples of strategy implementation are provided for all aspects required to ensure data validity: (i) documentation of test methods in a publicly accessible database; (ii) deposition of standard operating procedures (SOP) at the European Union DB-ALM repository; (iii) test readiness scoring accoding to defined criteria; (iv) disclosure of the pipeline for data processing; (v) link of uncertainty measures and metadata to the data; (vi) definition of test chemicals, their handling and their behavior in test media; (vii) specification of the test purpose and overall evaluation plans. Moreover, data generation was exemplified by providing results from 25 reporter assays. A complete evaluation of the entire test battery will be described elsewhere. A major learning from the retrospective analysis of this large testing project was the need for thorough definitions of the above strategy aspects, ideally in form of a study pre-registration, to allow adequate interpretation of the data and to ensure overall scientific/toxicological validity."

  "description": "miRNA target identification and prediction as a function of time in gene expression dataThe understanding of miRNAtarget interactions is still limited due to conflicting data and the fact that high-quality validation of targets is a time-consuming process. Faster methods like high-throughput screens and bioinformatics predictions are employed but suffer from several problems. One of these, namely the potential occurrence of downstream (i.e. secondary) effects in high-throughput screens has been only little discussed so far. However, such effects limit usage for both the identification of interactions and for the training of bioinformatics tools. In order to analyse this problem more closely, we performed time-dependent microarray screening experiments overexpressing human miR-517a-3p, and, together with published time-dependent datasets of human miR-17-5p, miR-135b and miR-124 overexpression, we analysed the dynamics of deregulated genes. We show that the number of deregulated targets increases over time, whereas seed sequence content and performance of several miRNAtarget prediction algorithms actually decrease over time. Bioinformatics recognition success of validated miR-17 targets was comparable to that of data gained only 12h post-transfection. We therefore argue that the timing of microarray experiments is of critical importance for detecting direct targets with high confidence and for the usability of these data for the training of bioinformatics prediction tools."

  "description": "Double hybrid DFT calculations with Slater type orbitalsOn a comprehensive database with 1,644 datapoints, covering several aspects of main-group as well as of transition metal chemistry, we assess the performance of 60 density functional approximations (DFA), among them 36 double hybrids (DH). All calculations are performed using a Slater type orbital (STO) basis set of triple-\u03b6 (TZ) quality and the highly efficient pair atomic resolution of the identity approach for the exchange- and Coulomb-term of the KS matrix (PARI-K and PARI-J, respectively) and for the evaluation of the MP2 energy correction (PARI-MP2). Employing the quadratic scaling SOS-AO-PARI-MP2 algorithm, DHs based on the spin-opposite-scaled (SOS) MP2 approximation are benchmarked against a database of large molecules. We evaluate the accuracy of STO/PARI calculations for B3LYP as well as for the DH B2GP-PLYP and show that the combined basis set and PARI-error is comparable to the one obtained using the well-known def2-TZVPP Gaussian-type basis set in conjunction with global density fitting. While quadruple-\u03b6 (QZ) calculations are currently not feasible for PARI-MP2 due to numerical issues, we show that, on the TZ level, Jacob's ladder for classifying DFAs is reproduced. However, while the best DHs are more accurate than the best hybrids, the improvements are less pronounced than the ones commonly found on the QZ level. For conformers of organic molecules and noncovalent interactions where very high accuracy is required for qualitatively correct results, DHs provide only small improvements over hybrids, while they still excel in thermochemistry, kinetics, transition metal chemistry and the description of strained organic systems."

For the first time, our combined activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analysis approach have revealed the interplay of physical factors that control the regioselectivity of these chemical reactions. Ring-opening under basic conditions occurs in a regime of strong interaction between the nucleophile (OH\u2013) and the epoxide and the interaction is governed by the steric (Pauli) repulsion. The latter steers the attack preferentially towards the sterically less encumbered C\u03b2. Under acidic conditions, the interaction between the nucleophile (H2O) and the epoxide is weak and, now, the regioselectivity is governed by the activation strain. Protonation of the epoxide induces elongation of the weaker (CH3)2C\u03b1\u2013O bond, and effectively predistorts the substrate for the attack at the sterically more hindered side, which goes with a less destabilizing overall strain energy. Our quantitative analysis significantly builds on the widely accepted rationales behind the regioselectivity of these ring-opening reactions and provide a concrete framework for understanding these indispensable textbook reactions."

Cs2ZnCl4 has a wide band gap (4.8 eV), and its crystal structure is composed of isolated ZnCl4 tetrahedra surrounded by Cs+ cations. According to our electron paramagnetic resonance analysis, in 0.7 and 2.1% Cu-doped NCs the Cu ions were present in the +1 oxidation state only, while in NCs at higher Cu concentrations we could detect Cu(II) ions (isovalently substituting the Zn(II) ions). The undoped Cs2ZnCl4 NCs were non emissive, while the Cu-doped samples had a bright intragap photoluminescence (PL) at \u00e22.6 eV mediated by band-edge absorption. Interestingly, the PL quantum yield was maximum (\u00e255%) for the samples with a low Cu concentration ([Cu] \u2264 2.1%), and it systematically decreased when further increasing the concentration of Cu, reaching 15% for the NCs with the highest doping level ([Cu] = 7.5%). The same (\u00e22.55 eV) emission band was detected under X-ray excitation. Our density functional theory calculations indicated that the PL emission could be ascribed only to Cu(I) ions: These ions promote the formation of trapped excitons, through which an efficient emission takes place. Overall, these Cu-doped Cs2ZnCl4 NCs, with their high photo- A nd radio-luminescence emission in the blue spectral region that is free from reabsorption, are particularly suitable for applications in ionizing radiation detection.

  "description": "The energetic basis of population growth in animal kingdomPopulation growth, and other population characteristics, have been computed and made available online for over 2000 animal species in the Add-my-Pet (AmP) collection, assuming constant food and temperature environments. The AmP collection \u2013 online database of Dynamic Energy Budget model parameters, implied properties and referenced underlying data \u2013 provides an unique opportunity to study how energetics of individuals relates to population growth. For the comparisons of traits, we assume that the background hazard rate is zero, but aging applies to all species and \u2018thinning\u2019 to species with high reproduction rates. The new concept \u2018thinning\u2019 is a state-dependent hazard rate such that the feeding rate of a cohort does not change in time: the increase of individual feeding rates due to growth is exactly compensated by a reduction in numbers. Thinning affects population growth rate, but the impact differs substantially between species. Some 11% of species do not survive thinning, even at abundant food. The population growth rate relates to the underlying energetics; we discuss and suggest explanations for how population growth rates fit into all known patterns in the co-variation of parameter values: body size-scaling, metabolic acceleration, waste-to-hurry, supply-demand spectrum and altricial-precocial spectrum. We show that, after reproduction, age at puberty dominates population growth. The specific population growth rate scales with maximum body weight in the same way as the weight-specific respiration scales with body weight. DEB theory, which explains both, shows, however, that no direct relationship exists between the population growth rate and respiration. We suggest that the similarity in scaling results from the equality between specific population growth and specific growth rate at maximum growth of structure, and might be an evolutionary relict from times that life consisted of dividing unicellulars; population and body growth are directly connected for unicellulars. We show that the specific growth rate at maximum growth equals 1.5 times the von Bertalanffy growth rate, in a DEB context, which is a new interpretation of the latter growth rate. We expected the population growth rate to co-vary with specific somatic maintenance rate, based on a previously discovered pattern, called the waste-to-hurry strategy, where growth and reproduction are increased by simultaneously increasing assimilation and somatic maintenance in species that live off temporarily abundant food supplies. We did find this effect in ecdysozoa and spiralia, which comprise roughly 95% of animal species, but hardly so in tetrapods. The reason might be that specific somatic maintenance also co-varies with specific maturity levels at puberty for tetrapods. The scaled functional response at which the population growth rate is zero is very close to that at which puberty can just be reached in absence of thinning, and somewhat higher in presence of thinning. The specific population growth rate at abundant food correlates negatively with the functional response for which population growth rate is zero. It also correlates negatively with the precociality index, i.e. the ratio of maturity levels at puberty and birth: the more precocial, the larger neonate size, the smaller reproduction rate, especially in restricted taxa such as mammals and cartilaginous fish. Like other traits, the population growth rate shows considerable segregation among taxa, where mammals have a relatively low rate, glires a relatively high rate among mammals, followed by marsupials; afrotherians have the lowest population growth rates."

  "description": "Structure-Activity Relationship of Phenylpyrazolones against Trypanosoma cruziChagas disease is a neglected parasitic disease caused by the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi and currently affects around 8 million people. Previously, 2-isopropyl-5-(4-methoxy-3-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one (NPD-0227) was discovered to be a sub-micromolar inhibitor (pIC50=6.4) of T. cruzi. So far, SAR investigations of this scaffold have focused on the alkoxy substituent, the pyrazolone nitrogen substituent and the aromatic substituent of the core phenylpyrazolone. In this study, modifications of the phenyldihydropyrazolone scaffold are described. Variations were introduced by installing different substituents on the phenyl core, modifying the geminal dimethyl and installing various bio-isosteres of the dihydropyrazolone group. The anti T. cruzi activity of NPD-0227 could not be surpassed as the most potent compounds show pIC50 values of around 6.3. However, valuable additional SAR data for this interesting scaffold was obtained, and the data suggest that a scaffold hop is feasible as the pyrazolone moiety can be replaced by a oxazole or oxadiazole with minimal loss of activity."

  "description": "The CTD Is Not Essential for the Post-Initiation Control of RNA Polymerase II ActivityInterest in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) has been revived in recent years, owing to its numerous posttranslational modifications and its \u201cphase-separation\u201d properties. A large number of studies have shown that the status of CTD modifications is associated with the activity of Pol II during the transcription cycle. However, because this domain is essential in living cells, the functional requirement of the full CTD for the control of Pol II activity at endogenous mammalian genes has never been addressed directly in living cells. Using an inducible Pol II-degradation system that we previously established, we investigated here the roles of the CTD in the post-initiation control of Pol II. The selective ablation of the RPB1 CTD, post-initiation, at promoter-proximal pause-sites revealed that this domain, and by extension the CTD heptads and their modifications, is functionally neither absolutely required to maintain pausing in the absence of CDK9 activity nor essential for the release of Pol II into productive elongation."

  "description": "Cloning and functional complementation of ten Schistosoma mansoni phosphodiesterases expressed in the mammalian host stagesOnly a single drug against schistosomiasis is currently available and new drug development is urgently required but very few drug targets have been validated and characterised. However, regulatory systems including cyclic nucleotide metabolism are emerging as primary candidates for drug discovery. Here, we report the cloning of ten cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) genes of S. mansoni, out of a total of 11 identified in its genome. We classify these PDEs by homology to human PDEs. Male worms displayed higher expression levels for all PDEs, in mature and juvenile worms, and schistosomula. Several functional complementation approaches were used to characterise these genes. We constructed a Trypanosoma brucei cell line in which expression of a cAMP-degrading PDE complements the deletion of TbrPDEB1/B2. Inhibitor screens of these cells expressing only either SmPDE4A, TbrPDEB1 or TbrPDEB2, identified highly potent inhibitors of the S. mansoni enzyme that elevated the cellular cAMP concentration. We further expressed most of the cloned SmPDEs in two pde1\u0394/pde2\u0394 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some also in a specialised strain of Schizosacharomyces pombe. Five PDEs, SmPDE1, SmPDE4A, SmPDE8, SmPDE9A and SmPDE11 successfully complemented the S. cerevisiae strains, and SmPDE7var also complemented to a lesser degree, in liquid culture. SmPDE4A, SmPDE8 and SmPDE11 were further assessed in S. pombe for hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP; SmPDE11 displayed considerable preferrence for cGMP over cAMP. These results and tools enable the pursuit of a rigorous drug discovery program based on inhibitors of S. mansoni PDEs."

  "description": "An annotation database for chemicals of emerging concern in exposome researchBackground: Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) include a very wide group of chemicals that are suspected to be responsible for adverse effects on health, but for which very limited information is available. Chromatographic techniques coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can be used for non-targeted screening and detection of CECs, by using comprehensive annotation databases. Establishing a database focused on the annotation of CECs in human samples will provide new insight into the distribution and extent of exposures to a wide range of CECs in humans. Objectives: This study describes an approach for the aggregation and curation of an annotation database (CECscreen) for the identification of CECs in human biological samples. Methods: The approach consists of three main parts. First, CECs compound lists from various sources were aggregated and duplications and inorganic compounds were removed. Subsequently, the list was curated by standardization of structures to create \u201cMS-ready\u201d and \u201cQSAR-ready\u201d SMILES, as well as calculation of exact masses (monoisotopic and adducts) and molecular formulas. The second step included the simulation of Phase I metabolites. The third and final step included the calculation of QSAR predictions related to physicochemical properties, environmental fate, toxicity and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) processes and the retrieval of information from the US EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard. Results: All CECscreen database and property files are publicly available (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3956586). In total, 145,284 entries were aggregated from various CECs data sources. After elimination of duplicates and curation, the pipeline produced 70,397 unique \u201cMS-ready\u201d structures and 66,071 unique QSAR-ready structures, corresponding with 69,526 CAS numbers. Simulation of Phase I metabolites resulted in 306,279 unique metabolites. QSAR predictions could be performed for 64,684 of the QSAR-ready structures, whereas information was retrieved from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard for 59,739 CAS numbers out of 69,526 inquiries. CECscreen is incorporated in the in silico fragmentation approach MetFrag. Discussion: The CECscreen database can be used to prioritize annotation of CECs measured in non-targeted HRMS, facilitating the large-scale detection of CECs in human samples for exposome research. Large-scale detection of CECs can be further improved by integrating the present database with resources that contain CECs (metabolites) and meta-data measurements, further expansion towards in silico and experimental (e.g., MassBank) generation of MS/MS spectra, and development of bioinformatics approaches capable of using correlation patterns in the measured chemical features."

  "description": "Optimization of a low flow sampler for improved assessment of gas and particle bound exposure to chlorinated paraffinsAn optimized low volume sampler was developed to determine both gas- and particle bound concentrations of short and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (S/MCCPs). Background contamination was limited by the sampler design, providing method quantification limits (MQLs) at least two orders of magnitude lower than other studies within the gas (MQL: 500 pg (\u03a3SCCPs), 1.86 ng (\u03a3MCCPs)) and particle (MQL: 500 pg (\u03a3SCCPs), 1.72 ng (\u03a3MCCPs) phases. Good repeatability was observed between parallel indoor measurements (RSD \u2264 9.3% (gas), RSD \u2264 14% (particle)) with no breakthrough/saturation observed after a week of continuous sampling. For indoor air sampling, SCCPs were dominant within the gas phase (17 \u00b1 4.9 ng/m3) compared to MCCPs (2.7 \u00b1 0.8 ng/m3) while the opposite was observed in the particle bound fraction (0.28 \u00b1 0.11 ng/m3 (\u03a3SCCPs) vs. 2.7 \u00b1 1.0 ng/m3 (\u03a3MCCPs)). Only SCCPs in the gas phase could be detected reliably during outdoor sampling and were considerably lower compared to indoor concentrations (0.27 \u00b1 0.10 ng/m3). Separation of the gas and particle bound phase was found to be crucial in applying the appropriate response factors for quantification based on the deconvoluted S/MCCP sample profile, thus avoiding over- (gas phase) or underestimation (particle phase) of reported concentrations. Very short chain chlorinated paraffins (vSCCPs, C5-C9) were also detected at equal or higher abundance compared to SCCP congener groups (C10-C13) congener groups, indicating an additional human indoor inhalation risk."

For one semester, children in one school were randomized to receive a probiotic (N = 79) or placebo (N = 85) fermented dairy food each day they attended school; one child (due to medical reasons) and all children in the other school (N = 98) continued their diets as usual. Children provided two saliva samples at 11:30 on consecutive days at the end of the study. Analyses revealed that the probiotic group had lower cortisol than the placebo or diet-as-usual groups (p =.015); CRP levels were comparable across groups (p =.549). Exploratory analyses suggested that dose and regularity of consumption may impact the biomarkers as well. This study provides the first evidence that a probiotic milk product may lower cortisol in a sample of young, economically-disadvantaged children."

  "description": "Seasonal Changes in Hemolymph Parameters of the Bivalve Modiolus kurilensis Bernard, 1983 from Vostok Bay, Sea of JapanAbstract: Hemolymph is one of the main tissues providing invertebrates\u2019 immunity and homeostasis. Earlier, we showed that some of the hemolymph immune parameters of the common Far Eastern mollusk Modiolus kurilensis are sensitive to bacterial and anthropogenic challenges. In this work, a number of cellular parameters such as total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte phagocytic activity (PA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and humoral parameters such as hemagglutination (HA) and hemolytic (HL) activity of plasma, as well as its protein concentration (CP) and profiling in M. kurilensis were studied depending on the season and environmental indicators (temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration). The total hemocyte count was weakly correlated with water oxygen concentration (R = \u20130.25) and temperature (R = 0.27), and the 36 kDa plasma protein was weakly correlated with temperature (R = \u20130.33). Also, there was a correlation (R = 0.38) between hemagglutination activity and the 19 kDa protein fraction. The minimum values for a number of parameters were noted in January (THC, PA, ROS, HA, HL), while the maximum values were observed in late spring (THC, PA, ROS, HA, HL). At the same time, in other months, these and most other parameters had metastable values. Thus, the indicators that were identified in previous studies (THC, PA, ROS, HA, HL, CP, protein fractions 55 and 124 kDa) are suitable for assessing the physiological state of M. kurilensis during most of the year."

  "description": "Constructing strings avoiding forbidden substringsWe consider the problem of constructing strings over an alphabet \u03a3 that start with a given prefix u, end with a given suffix v, and avoid occurrences of a given set of forbidden substrings. In the decision version of the problem, given a set Sk of forbidden substrings, each of length k, over \u03a3, we are asked to decide whether there exists a string x over \u03a3 such that u is a prefix of x, v is a suffix of x, and no s \u03f5 Sk occurs in x. Our first result is an O(|u| + |v| + k|Sk|)-time algorithm to decide this problem. In the more general optimization version of the problem, given a set S of forbidden arbitrary-length substrings over \u03a3, we are asked to construct a shortest string x over S such that u is a prefix of x, v is a suffix of x, and no s \u03f5 S occurs in x. Our second result is an O(|u| + |v| + ||S|| \u00b7 |\u03a3|)-time algorithm to solve this problem, where ||S|| denotes the total length of the elements of S. Interestingly, our results can be directly applied to solve the reachability and shortest path problems in complete de Bruijn graphs in the presence of forbidden edges or of forbidden paths. Our algorithms are motivated by data privacy, and in particular, by the data sanitization process. In the context of strings, sanitization consists in hiding forbidden substrings from a given string by introducing the least amount of spurious information. We consider the following problem. Given a string w of length n over \u03a3, an integer k, and a set Sk of forbidden substrings, each of length k, over \u03a3, construct a shortest string y over \u03a3 such that no s \u03f5 Sk occurs in y and the sequence of all other length-k fragments occurring in w is a subsequence of the sequence of the length-k fragments occurring in y. Our third result is an O(nk|Sk| \u00b7 |\u03a3|)-time algorithm to solve this problem."

  "description": "String sanitization under edit distance: Improved and generalizedLet W be a string of length n over an alphabet S, k be a positive integer, and S be a set of length-k substrings of W. The ETFS problem (Edit distance, Total order, Frequency, Sanitization) asks us to construct a string XEDsuch that: (i) no string of S occurs in XED; (ii) the order of all other length-k substrings over \u03a3 (and thus the frequency) is the same in W and in XED; and (iii) XEDhas minimal edit distance to W. When W represents an individual's data and S represents a set of confidential patterns, the ETFS problem asks for transforming W to preserve its privacy and its utility [Bernardini et al., ECML PKDD 2019]. ETFS can be solved in O(n2k) time [Bernardini et al., CPM 2020]. The same paper shows that ETFS cannot be solved in O(n2-\u03b4) time, for any \u03b4 > 0, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. Our main results can be summarized as follows: An O(n2log2k)-time algorithm to solve ETFS. An O(n2log2n)-time algorithm to solve AETFS (Arbitrary lengths, Edit distance, Total order, Frequency, Sanitization), a generalization of ETFS in which the elements of S can have arbitrary lengths. Our algorithms are thus optimal up to subpolynomial factors, unless SETH fails. In order to arrive at these results, we develop new techniques for computing a variant of the standard dynamic programming (DP) table for edit distance. In particular, we simulate the DP table computation using a directed acyclic graph in which every node is assigned to a smaller DP table. We then focus on redundancy in these DP tables and exploit a tabulation technique according to dyadic intervals to obtain an optimal alignment in O(n2) total time1. Beyond string sanitization, our techniques may inspire solutions to other problems related to regular expressions or context-free grammars."

  "description": "PPE38-Secretion-Dependent Proteins of M. tuberculosis Alter NF-kB Signalling and Inflammatory Responses in MacrophagesIt was previously shown that secretion of PE-PGRS and PPE-MPTR proteins is abolished in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates with a deletion in the ppe38-71 operon, which is associated with increased virulence. Here we investigate the proteins dependent on PPE38 for their secretion and their role in the innate immune response using temporal proteomics and protein turnover analysis in a macrophage infection model. A decreased pro-inflammatory response was observed in macrophages infected with PPE38-deficient M. tuberculosis CDC1551 as compared to wild type bacteria. We could show that dampening of the pro-inflammatory response is associated with activation of a RelB/p50 pathway, while the canonical inflammatory pathway is active during infection with wild type M. tuberculosis CDC1551. These results indicate a molecular mechanism by which M. tuberculosis PE/PPE proteins controlled by PPE38 have an effect on modulating macrophage responses through NF-kB signalling."

  "description": "Synergistic DNA- and Protein-Based Recognition Promote an RNA-Templated Bio-orthogonal ReactionBiomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non-covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, the structure-based design of peptide-DNA conjugates that bind RNA through Watson-Crick base pairing combined with peptide-mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA-templated click reaction. The introduced structure-based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies."

Weakly interacting LAs accelerate the Diels-Alder reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 3 kcal mol\u22121 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The reaction barriers systematically increase from halogen<hydrogen<chalcogen<pnictogen-bonded LAs, i. e., the latter have the least catalytic effect. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that these LAs lower the Diels-Alder reaction barrier by increasing the asynchronicity of the reaction to relieve the otherwise destabilizing Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled \u03c0-orbitals of diene and dienophile. Notably, the reactivity can be further enhanced on going from a Period 3 to a Period 5 LA, as these species amplify the asynchronicity of the Diels-Alder reaction due to a stronger binding to the dienophile. These findings again demonstrate the generality of the Pauli repulsion-lowering catalysis concept."

  "description": "Torpor enhances synaptic strength and restores memory performance in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s diseaseHibernation induces neurodegeneration-like changes in the brain, which are completely reversed upon arousal. Hibernation-induced plasticity may therefore be of great relevance for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, but remains largely unexplored. Here we show that a single torpor and arousal sequence in mice does not induce dendrite retraction and synapse loss as observed in seasonal hibernators. Instead, it increases hippocampal long-term potentiation and contextual fear memory. This is accompanied by increased levels of key postsynaptic proteins and mitochondrial complex I and IV proteins, indicating mitochondrial reactivation and enhanced synaptic plasticity upon arousal. Interestingly, a single torpor and arousal sequence was also sufficient to restore contextual fear memory in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Our study demonstrates that torpor in mice evokes an exceptional state of hippocampal plasticity and that naturally occurring plasticity mechanisms during torpor provide an opportunity to identify unique druggable targets for the treatment of cognitive impairment."

  "description": "Cytochrome bd as survival factor in mycobacteriaTargeting respiration and ATP synthesis has received strong interest as a new strategy for combating drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1,2]. Mycobacteria employ a respiratory chain terminating with two branches. One of the branches includes a cytochrome bc1 complex and an aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase while the other branch terminates with a cytochrome bd-type quinol oxidase. We have shown that genetic inactivation of cytochrome bd, but not of cytochrome bc1, enhances the susceptibility of Mycobacterium smegmatis to hydrogen peroxide and antibiotic-induced stress [3]. The type-II NADH dehydrogenase effector clofazimine and the ATP synthase inhibitor bedaquiline were bacteriostatic against wild-type M. smegmatis, but strongly bactericidal against a cytochrome bd knock-out mutant [3,4]. These results identify cytochrome bd as a key survival factor in mycobacteria. The quinone-analog aurachin D inhibited mycobacterial cytochrome bd at sub-micromolar concentrations. Progress towards the characterization of cytochrome bd and its inhibitors will be discussed. Targeting the cytochrome bd respiratory branch appears to be a promising strategy that may enhance the bactericidal activity of existing tuberculosis drugs."

  "description": "Infection of zebrafish embryos with live fluorescent Streptococcus pneumoniae as a real-time pneumococcal meningitis modelBackground: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of bacterial meningitis, an infection where unfavourable outcome is driven by bacterial and host-derived toxins. In this study, we developed and characterized a pneumococcal meningitis model in zebrafish embryos that allows for real-time investigation of early host-microbe interaction. Methods: Zebrafish embryos were infected in the caudal vein or hindbrain ventricle with green fluorescent wild-type S. pneumoniae D39 or a pneumolysin-deficient mutant. The kdrl:mCherry transgenic zebrafish line was used to visualize the blood vessels, whereas phagocytic cells were visualized by staining with far red anti-L-plastin or in mpx:GFP/mpeg1:mCherry zebrafish, that have green fluorescent neutrophils and red fluorescent macrophages. Imaging was performed by fluorescence confocal and time-lapse microscopy. Results: After infection by caudal vein, we saw focal clogging of the pneumococci in the blood vessels and migration of bacteria through the blood-brain barrier into the subarachnoid space and brain tissue. Infection with pneumolysin-deficient S. pneumoniae in the hindbrain ventricle showed attenuated growth and migration through the brain as compared to the wild-type strain. Time-lapse and confocal imaging revealed that the initial innate immune response to S. pneumoniae in the subarachnoid space mainly consisted of neutrophils and that pneumolysin-mediated cytolytic activity caused a marked reduction of phagocytes. Conclusions: This new meningitis model permits detailed analysis and visualization of host-microbe interaction in pneumococcal meningitis in real time and is a very promising tool to further our insights in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis."

  "description": "Generation of the membrane potential and its impact on the motility, ATP production and growth in Campylobacter jejuniThe generation of a membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8), the major constituent of the proton motive force (pmf), is crucial for ATP synthesis, transport of nutrients and flagellar rotation. Campylobacter jejuni harbors a branched electron transport chain, enabling respiration with different electron donors and acceptors. Here, we demonstrate that a relatively high \u0394\u03c8 is only generated in the presence of either formate as electron donor or oxygen as electron acceptor, in combination with an acceptor/donor respectively. We show the necessity of the pmf for motility and growth of C. jejuni. ATP generation is not only accomplished by oxidative phosphorylation via the pmf, but also by substrate-level phosphorylation via the enzyme AckA. In response to a low oxygen tension, C. jejuni increases the transcription and activity of the donor complexes formate dehydrogenase (FdhABC) and hydrogenase (HydABCD) as well as the transcription of the alternative respiratory acceptor complexes. Our findings suggest that in the gut of warm-blooded animals, C. jejuni depends on at least formate or hydrogen as donor (in the anaerobic lumen) or oxygen as acceptor (near the epithelial cells) to generate a pmf that sustains efficient motility and growth for colonization and pathogenesis."

  "description": "Experimental evolution and the adjustment of metabolic strategies in lactic acid bacteriaExperimental evolution of microbes has gained lots of interest in recent years, mainly due to the ease of strain characterisation through next-generation sequencing. While evolutionary and systems biologists use experimental evolution to address fundamental questions in their respective fields, studies with lactic acid bacteria are often more directed by applied questions. Insight into population and genome dynamics are valuable for experimental design and data interpretation, and it is becoming increasingly apparent how different constraints limit and govern the outcome of microbial adaptation to a selective environment. Examples for such constraints are the finite membrane and cellular space which can lead to trade-offs between cellular strategies. A powerful perspective is that of resource allocation, which allows cells to maximise fitness. This impacts on metabolic strategies that have different protein/resource demands. This review focuses on parameters and forces that shape cellular optimisation processes and that are determining for the outcome of laboratory evolution experiments. Phenotypic changes of experimentally evolved lactic acid bacteria will be discussed in the light of the selection conditions and the prevailing constraints."

Therefore, these components have been used to rationalize the differences in strength of hydrogen-bonded systems. A completely new viewpoint is presented, in which the Pauli (steric) repulsion controls the mechanism of hydrogen bonding. Quantum chemical computations on the mismatched DNA base pairs CC and GG (C=cytosine, G=guanine) show that the enhanced stabilization and shorter distance of GG is determined entirely by the difference in the Pauli repulsion, which is significantly less repulsive for GG than for CC. This is the first time that evidence is presented for the Pauli repulsion as decisive factor in relative hydrogen-bond strengths and lengths."

In this sense, Cs+ resembles hypervalent Xe."

The combination of these two readily available C1-reactants, featuring a huge difference in kinetic and thermodynamic stability, is hitherto unprecedented in transition-metal catalysis. With this one-pot three-component reaction, N3-substituted quinazoline-2,4(1H,3H)-diones are obtained in moderate to high yields in a completely regio- and chemoselective manner. Our approach easily allows variation of the arene and N3-substitution pattern of the desired heterocycle. The formal synthesis of different APIs illustrates its practical applicability. In addition, the methodology also allows for a convenient and selective 13C-labeling through the use of 13CO2.

  "description": "Copper(I) catalyzed oxidative hydrolysis of Ugi 3-component and Ugi-azide reaction products towards 2 degrees alpha-ketoamides and alpha-ketotetrazolesHerein, a two-step MCR-oxidation methodology accessing decorated 2\u00b0 \u03b1-ketoamides and \u03b1-ketotetrazoles is described via a catalytic copper(i)-mediated C-N oxidation/acidic hydrolysis of Ugi-three-component and Ugi-azide reaction products. The ability to install diversity from aldehyde and isocyanide synthons allows rapid complexity generation. Of note, (1) 2\u00b0 \u03b1-ketoamides are traditionally difficult to access and more so reminiscent of the endogenous peptide bonds. (2) The route to \u03b1-keto-tetrazoles is significantly shorter than that in previous reports."

  "description": "Fluorine-18 labelled building blocks for PET tracer synthesisPositron emission tomography (PET) is an important driver for present day healthcare. Fluorine-18 is the most widely used radioisotope for PET imaging and a thorough overview of the available radiochemistry methodology is a prerequisite for selection of a synthetic approach for new fluorine-18 labelled PET tracers. These PET tracers can be synthesised either by late-stage radiofluorination, introducing fluorine-18 in the last step of the synthesis, or by a building block approach (also called modular build-up approach), introducing fluorine-18 in a fast and efficient manner in a building block, which is reacted further in one or multiple reaction steps to form the PET tracer. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the synthesis and application of fluorine-18 labelled building blocks since 2010."

  "description": "How the electron-deficient cavity of heterocalixarenes recognizes anions: Insights from computationWe have quantum chemically analyzed the bonding mechanism behind the affinity of various heterocalixarenes for anions with a range of geometries and net charges, using modern dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D3BJ). The purpose is to better understand the physical factors that are responsible for the computed affinities and thus to develop principles for a more rational design of anion receptors. Our model systems comprise heterocalixarenes 1-4 as hosts, which are characterized by different bridging heteroatoms (O, N, S) as well as the anionic guests Cl-, Br-, I-, BF4 -, CH3CO2 -, H2PO4 -, HSO4 -, NCS-, NO3 -, PF6 -, and SO4 2-. We use various analysis schemes (EDA, NCI, and NBO) to elucidate the interactions between the calixarene cavity and the anions to probe the importance of the different bonding modes (anion-\u03c0, lone-pair electron-\u03c0, \u03c3-complexes, hydrogen bonds, and others) of the interactions. Electrostatic interactions appear to be dominant for heterocalixarenes with oxygen bridges whereas orbital interactions prevail in the case of nitrogen and sulfur bridges. Dispersion interactions are however in all cases non-negligible."

  "description": "Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry as a new tool for the characterization of intact semi-synthetic glycoproteinsImproved methods for detailed characterization of complex glycoproteins are required in the growing sector of biopharmaceuticals. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) coupled to high resolution (HR) time-of-flight mass spectrometric (TOF-MS) detection was examined for the characterization of intact neo-glycoproteins prepared by chemical conjugation of synthetic saccharides to the lysine residues of selected recombinant proteins. The separation performances of three different amide HILIC columns (TSKgel Amide-80, XBridge BEH and AdvanceBio Glycan Mapping) were tested. Water-acetonitrile gradients and volatile eluent additives have been explored. Addition of 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to the mobile phase appeared to be essential for achieving optimum resolution of intact glycoforms and minimal ion suppression effects. Gradient elution conditions were optimized for each protein on every column. HILIC stationary phases were evaluated for the analysis of highly heterogeneous semi-synthetic derivatives of the same protein (ribonuclease A), and in the enhanced characterization of TB10.4 and Ag85B glycoconjugates, selected antigens from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). HILIC-MS results indicated that the HILIC selectivity is predominantly governed by size of the conjugated glycans and number of glycans attached, providing efficient glycoform separation. Moreover, HILIC separation prior to HRMS detection allowed assignment of several product impurities. Additional top-down MS/MS experiments confirmed conjugation at the N-terminus of TB10.4 next to its lysine residue. Overall, the obtained results demonstrate that amide-stationary-phase based HILIC coupled to MS is highly useful for the characterization of intact neo-glycoproteins allowing assessment of the number, identity and relative abundance of glycoforms present in the semi-synthetic products."

  "description": "Cell Permeable Stapled Peptide Inhibitor of Wnt Signaling that Targets \u03b2-Catenin Protein-Protein InteractionsThe Wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell proliferation and differentiation, thus it is often associated with diseases such as cancers. Unfortunately, although attractive, developing anti-cancer strategy targeting Wnt signaling has been challenging given that the most attractive targets are involved in protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Here, we develop a stapled peptide inhibitor that targets the interaction between \u03b2-catenin and T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor transcription factors, which are crucially involved in Wnt signaling. Our integrative approach combines peptide stapling to optimize proteolytic stability, with lessons learned from cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) design to maximize cellular uptake resulting in NLS-StAx-h, a selective, cell permeable, stapled peptide inhibitor of oncogenic Wnt signaling that efficiently inhibits \u03b2-catenin-transcription factor interactions. We expect that this type of integrative strategy that endows stapled peptides with CPP features will be generally useful for developing inhibitors of intracellular PPIs. Dietrich et al. investigate the cellular uptake of cell-penetrating peptides and stapled peptides. Based on their findings, a poorly permeable stapled peptide is converted into an excellent cell penetrator capable of efficiently inhibiting Wnt signaling. This agent selectively inhibits the growth and migration of Wnt-dependent cancer cells."

  "description": "Role of Orbital Interactions and Activation Strain (Distortion Energies) on Reactivities in the Normal and Inverse Electron-Demand Cycloadditions of Strained and Unstrained CycloalkenesThe Diels-Alder reactivities of a series of cycloalkenes, from the highly strained cyclopropene to the unstrained cyclohexene, have been studied with density functional theory using the M06-2X functional. The normal electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions with cyclopentadiene and the inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reactions with 3,6-bis(trifluoromethyl)tetrazine were analyzed using the distortion/interaction-activation strain model. Previous studies showed that activation strain computed from the distorted reactants in the transition structures are larger for unstrained than strained cycloalkenes, and that most of the activation energy differences are accounted for by this difference. We have now analyzed the strain and interaction energy curves for the series of cycloalkenes along the reaction coordinate. Our analyses reveal that the strain curves associated with the distortion of the reactants in the Diels-Alder reactions are nearly identical and that the reactivity differences originate from differences in interaction energies. Analysis of the diene-dienophile interactions reveal that the reactivity trends result from differences in the strength of the primary and secondary orbital interactions."

  "description": "New Modalities for Challenging Targets in Drug DiscoveryAn ever increasing understanding of biological systems is providing a range of exciting novel biological targets whose modulation may enable novel therapeutic options in many diseases. These targets include protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, which are, however, often refractory to classical small molecule approaches. Other types of molecules, or modalities, are therefore required to address these targets, which has led several academic research groups and pharmaceutical companies to increasingly use the concept of so-called 'New Modalities'. This review defines for the first time the scope of this term, which includes novel peptidic scaffolds, oligonucleotides, hybrids, molecular conjugates as well as new uses of classical small molecules. We provide herein a journey through the most representative examples of these modalities to target large binding surface areas such as those found in protein-protein interactions and for biological processes at the center of cell regulation."

  "description": "Capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry as a highly selective tool for the compositional and site-specific assessment of multiple peptide-deamidationSite-specific mapping of multiple deamidations in peptides is a challenging analytical task. In this work, capillary electrophoresis-tandem mass spectrometry (CE-MS/MS) is presented as a high-resolution tool for the detailed characterization of these subtle modifications in peptides. The 4.5-kDa peptide drug TRI-1144, which contains five closely-positioned potential deamidation sites, was selected as model compound. TRI-1144 was exposed to acidic conditions and/or elevated temperatures for 1\u201314 h. Stressed samples were analyzed using a background electrolyte (BGE) of 150 mM ammonium formate (pH 6.0) in combination with a capillary coated with a bilayer of Polybrene-dextran sulfate. Separation of deamidated and deacetylated TRI-1144 species, including several positional isomers, was greatly enhanced by adding up to 40 vol% of acetonitrile-isopropanol (87.5:12.5, v/v) to the BGE, allowing reliable determination of the number of deamidations/deacetylations per degradation product. Collision-induced dissociation MS/MS was conducted on the separated peptide components in order to reveal the exact position of deamidation on the peptide chain. Obtained fragment ions showed overlapping isotopic distributions in their MS/MS spectra resulting from the comigration of different isomeric deamidated species. Comparison of theoretical and measured isotope distributions for specific y ions of peptide fragments yielded the identity and relative abundance of isomeric deamidated products. The developed CE-MS/MS methodology was used for the highly selective evaluation of TRI-1144 stability under different stress conditions, providing detailed qualitative and semi-quantitative degradation maps of the peptide drug."

The presence of guest compounds has been shown to influence this cyclodextrin aggregation process. In an attempt to gain insight into the effect of the physicochemical properties of the guest compound on 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin aggregation formation, a series of structurally related parabens was selected as model compounds. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and phase solubility studies, these parabens, differing only in side chain length, were demonstrated to form inclusion complexes with 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. Additional techniques were subsequently applied to evaluate the aggregation behavior of this cyclodextrin in presence of the selected parabens. Solutions containing a broad range of 2-hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin concentrations were saturated with the guest compounds and were used as test media. Results obtained from dialysis experiments, dynamic light scattering and mass spectrometry revealed a positive effect of the side chain length of the parabens on aggregate formation: in presence of heptylparaben, more and larger aggregates were observed than in presence of parabens with shorter side chains such as methyl- and butylparaben. No clear connection could be demonstrated between the cyclodextrin concentration and the extent of aggregate formation in presence of the guest compound."

  "description": "Chiral capillary electrophoresis with UV-excited fluorescence detection for the enantioselective analysis of 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-derivatized amino acidsThe potential of capillary electrophoresis (CE) with ultraviolet (UV)-excited fluorescence detection for sensitive chiral analysis of amino acids (AAs) was investigated. dl-AAs were derivatized with 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chloride (FMOC)-Cl to allow their fluorescence detection and enhance enantioseparation. Fluorescence detection was achieved employing optical fibers, leading UV excitation light (< 300nm) from a Xe-Hg lamp to the capillary window, and fluorescence emission to a spectrograph equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD). Signal averaging over time and emission wavelength intervals was carried out to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the FMOC-AAs. A background electrolyte (BGE) of 40mM sodium tetraborate (pH 9.5), containing 15% isopropanol (v/v), 30mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 30mM \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD), was found optimal for AA chemo- and enantioseparation. Enantioresolutions of 1.0 or higher were achieved for 16 proteinogenic dl-AAs. Limits of detection (LODs) were in the 10\u2013100-nM range (injected concentration) for the d-AA enantiomers, except for FMOC-d-tryptophan (536nM) which showed intramolecular fluorescence quenching. Linearity (R2 > 0.997) and repeatability for peak height (relative standard deviations (RSDs) < 7.0%; n = 5) and electrophoretic mobility (RSDs < 0.6%; n = 5) of individual AA enantiomers were established for chiral analysis of dl-AA mixtures. The applicability of the method was investigated by the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Next to l-AAs, endogenous levels of d-glutamine and d-aspartic acid could be measured in CSF revealing enantiomeric ratios of 0.35 and 19.6%, respectively. This indicates the method\u2019s potential for the analysis of low concentrations of d-AAs in presence of abundant l-AAs."

  "description": "Comparison of base-line and chemical-induced transcriptomic responses in HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cells using TempO-SeqThe utilisation of genome-wide transcriptomics has played a pivotal role in advancing the field of toxicology, allowing the mapping of transcriptional signatures to chemical exposures. These activities have uncovered several transcriptionally regulated pathways that can be utilised for assessing the perturbation impact of a chemical and also the identification of toxic mode of action. However, current transcriptomic platforms are not very amenable to high-throughput workflows due to, high cost, complexities in sample preparation and relatively complex bioinformatic analysis. Thus, transcriptomic investigations are usually limited in dose and time dimensions and are, therefore, not optimal for implementation in risk assessment workflows. In this study, we investigated a new cost-effective, transcriptomic assay, TempO-Seq, which alleviates the aforementioned limitations. This technique was evaluated in a 6-compound screen, utilising differentiated kidney (RPTEC/TERT1) and liver (HepaRG) cells and compared to non-transcriptomic label-free sensitive endpoints of chemical-induced disturbances, namely phase contrast morphology, xCELLigence and glycolysis. Non-proliferating cell monolayers were exposed to six sub-lethal concentrations of each compound for 24h. The results show that utilising a 2839 gene panel, it is possible to discriminate basal tissue-specific signatures, generate dose\u2013response relationships and to discriminate compound-specific and cell type-specific responses. This study also reiterates previous findings that chemical-induced transcriptomic alterations occur prior to cytotoxicity and that transcriptomics provides in depth mechanistic information of the effects of chemicals on cellular transcriptional responses. TempO-Seq is a robust transcriptomic platform that is well suited for in vitro toxicity experiments."

  "description": "Feasibility of a novel on-site detection method for aflatoxin in maize flour from markets and selected households in Kampala, UgandaIn sub-Saharan Africa, there is a high demand for affordable and accessible methods for on-site detection of aflatoxins for appropriate food safety management. In this study, we validated an electrochemical immunosensor device by the on-site detection of 60 maize flour samples from six markets and 72 samples from households in Kampala. The immunosensor was successfully validated with a linear range from 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 to 11 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5g/kg and limit of detection (LOD) of 0.7 \u00b5g/kg. The maize flour samples from the markets had a mean total aflatoxin concentration of 7.6 \u00b1 2.3 \u00b5g/kg with approximately 20% of the samples higher than 10 \u00b5g/kg, which is the maximum acceptable level in East Africa. Further down the distribution chain, at the household level, approximately 45% of the total number contained total aflatoxin levels higher than the acceptable limit. The on-site detection method correlated well with the established laboratory-based HPLC and ELISA-detection methods for aflatoxin B1 with the correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.98, respectively. This study shows the feasibility of a novel on-site detection method and articulates the severity of aflatoxin contamination in Uganda."

Therefore, the presence of microplastics in marine species for human consumption and the high intake of seafood (fish and shellfish) in some countries cause concern about the potential effects of microplastics on human health. In this brief review, the evidence of seafood contamination by microplastics is reviewed, and the potential consequences of the presence of microplastics in the marine environment for human food security, food safety and health are discussed. Furthermore, challenges and gaps in knowledge are identified. The knowledge on the adverse effects on human health due to the consumption of marine organisms containing microplastics is very limited, difficult to assess and still controversial. Thus, assessment of the risk posed to humans is challenging. Research is urgently needed, especially regarding the potential exposure and associated health risk to micro- and nano-sized plastics."

  "description": "Multiple-choice knapsack for assigning partial atomic charges in drug-like moleculesA key factor in computational drug design is the consistency and reliability with which intermolecular interactions between a wide variety of molecules can be described. Here we present a procedure to efficiently, reliably and automatically assign partial atomic charges to atoms based on known distributions. We formally introduce the molecular charge assignment problem, where the task is to select a charge from a set of candidate charges for every atom of a given query molecule. Charges are accompanied by a score that depends on their observed frequency in similar neighbourhoods (chemical environments) in a database of previously parameterised molecules. The aim is to assign the charges such that the total charge equals a known target charge within a margin of error while maximizing the sum of the charge scores. We show that the problem is a variant of the well-studied multiple-choice knapsack problem and thus weakly NP-complete. We propose solutions based on Integer Linear Programming and a pseudo-polynomial time Dynamic Programming algorithm. We show that the results obtained for novel molecules not included in the database are comparable to the ones obtained performing explicit charge calculations while decreasing the time to determine partial charges for a molecule by several orders of magnitude, that is, from hours or even days to below a second. Our software is openly available at https://github.com/enitram/charge-assign."

Previous research has identified promising candidate peptides in snake venom. In this study, venoms from different snake species (Naja annulifera, Naja kaouthia, Ophiophagus hannah and Echis carinatus) were screened for potential anti-cancer properties using pancreatic tumour cells as the assay system. The cells were incubated with venom and then subjected to the following analyses: (i) in vitro cell death (ii) in vitro migration (iii) in vivo dissemination and (iv) in vivo angiogenesis. For the in vivo assays, the cells, after incubation and labelling, were transplanted into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos for motility and angiogenesis. The results showed strong effects in cells treated with venoms from Ophiophagus hannah and Echis carinatus in the in vitro assays. In the in vivo assays, venom derived from Ophiophagus hannah had the most potent effects with respect to angiogenesis. These venoms might therefore be considered as candidates for further studies."

  "description": "A mechanistic computational model reveals that plasticity of CD4+ T cell differentiation is a function of cytokine composition and dosageCD4+ T cells provide cell-mediated immunity in response to various antigens. During an immune response, na\u00efve CD4+ T cells differentiate into specialized effector T helper (Th1, Th2, and Th17) cells and induced regulatory (iTreg) cells based on a cytokine milieu. In recent studies, complex phenotypes resembling more than one classical T cell lineage have been experimentally observed. Herein, we sought to characterize the capacity of T cell differentiation in response to the complex extracellular environment. We constructed a comprehensive mechanistic (logical) computational model of the signal transduction that regulates T cell differentiation. The model's dynamics were characterized and analyzed under 511 different environmental conditions. Under these conditions, the model predicted the classical as well as the novel complex (mixed) T cell phenotypes that can co-express transcription factors (TFs) related to multiple differentiated T cell lineages. Analyses of the model suggest that the lineage decision is regulated by both compositions and dosage of signals that constitute the extracellular environment. In this regard, we first characterized the specific patterns of extracellular environments that result in novel T cell phenotypes. Next, we predicted the inputs that can regulate the transition between the canonical and complex T cell phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we predicted the optimal levels of inputs that can simultaneously maximize the activity of multiple lineage-specifying TFs and that can drive a phenotype toward one of the co-expressed TFs. In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the plasticity of CD4+ T cell differentiation, and also acts as a tool to design testable hypotheses for the generation of complex T cell phenotypes by various input combinations and dosages."

  "description": "Simulation of stimulation: Cytokine dosage and cell cycle crosstalk driving timing-dependent T cell differentiationTriggering an appropriate protective response against invading agents is crucial to the effectiveness of human innate and adaptive immunity. Pathogen recognition and elimination requires integration of a myriad of signals from many different immune cells. For example, T cell functioning is not qualitatively, but quantitatively determined by cellular and humoral signals. Tipping the balance of signals, such that one of these is favored or gains advantage on another one, may impact the plasticity of T cells. This may lead to switching their phenotypes and, ultimately, modulating the balance between proliferating and memory T cells to sustain an appropriate immune response. We hypothesize that, similar to other intracellular processes such as the cell cycle, the process of T cell differentiation is the result of: (i) pleiotropy (pattern) and (ii) magnitude (dosage/concentration) of input signals, as well as (iii) their timing and duration. That is, a flexible, yet robust immune response upon recognition of the pathogen may result from the integration of signals at the right dosage and timing. To investigate and understand how system's properties such as T cell plasticity and T cell-mediated robust response arise from the interplay between these signals, the use of experimental toolboxes that modulate immune proteins may be explored. Currently available methodologies to engineer T cells and a recently devised strategy to measure protein dosage may be employed to precisely determine, for example, the expression of transcription factors responsible for T cell differentiation into various subtypes. Thus, the immune response may be systematically investigated quantitatively. Here, we provide a perspective of how pattern, dosage and timing of specific signals, called interleukins, may influence T cell activation and differentiation during the course of the immune response. We further propose that interleukins alone cannot explain the phenotype variability observed in T cells. Specifically, we provide evidence that the dosage of intercellular components of both the immune system and the cell cycle regulating cell proliferation may contribute to T cell activation, differentiation, as well as T cell memory formation and maintenance. Altogether, we envision that a qualitative (pattern) and quantitative (dosage) crosstalk between the extracellular milieu and intracellular proteins leads to T cell plasticity and robustness. The understanding of this complex interplay is crucial to predict and prevent scenarios where tipping the balance of signals may be compromised, such as in autoimmunity."

  "description": "A practical guide for probiotics applied to the case of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in The NetherlandsBackground: Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is a side-effect frequently associated with the use of broad spectrum antibiotics. Although a number of clinical studies show that co-administration of specific probiotics reduces the risk for AAD, there is still unclarity among healthcare professionals on the recommendation of probiotic products. This paper aims at a practical guide to inform healthcare professionals, patients and consumers about the exact product characteristics of available probiotics with a proven efficacy to prevent AAD. Methods: The workflow in this paper includes three consecutive steps: 1) systematic review of relevant clinical studies for effective probiotics by a meta-analysis, 2) compilation of a list of available probiotic products, and 3) recommendation of probiotic products that match effective formulations. Our systematic review on the efficacy of probiotics for the prevention of AAD included only studies with randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trials, a clear definition of antibiotic associated diarrhea, and a probiotic administration regime for at least the duration of the antibiotic therapy. Results: Using our inclusion criteria, we selected 32 out of 128 identified trials and pooled the results of these studies for each specific dairy product and food supplement. The results indicate a total of seven single or multiple-strain formulations favoring the probiotic treatment group, with the strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG being the most effective [relative risk ratio of probiotic versus placebo 0.30 (95% CI 0.16-0.5)]. We selected products for recommendation from a compiled list of all probiotic dairy products and food supplements available in The Netherlands and categorized them into groups of products showing effects against the incidence of AAD in at least one, two or three independent clinical studies. We excluded all products which did not unambiguously declare on the label the specific probiotic strain(s) and the number of colony forming units. Conclusion: Here we present a practical guide that informs healthcare professionals and patients on the availability of probiotic products with a proven efficacy for the prevention of AAD."

  "description": "Density functional approximations for orbital energies and total energies of molecules and solidsThe relation of Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital energies to ionization energies and electron affinities is different in molecules and solids. In molecules, the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximations (GGA) approximate the exact ionization energy (I) and affinity (A) rather well with self-consistently calculated (total energy based) ILDFA and ALDFA, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, however, differ significantly (by typically 4-6 eV) from these quantities, \u03f5HLDFA(mol)>-I(mol)\u2248-ILDFA(mol), \u03f5LLDFA(mol)<-A(mol)\u2248-ALDFA(mol). In solids, these relations are very different, due to two effects. The (almost) infinite extent of a solid makes the difference of orbital energies and (L)DFA calculated ionization energy and affinity disappear: in the solid state limit, \u03f5H(L)DFA(solid)=-I(L)DFA(solid) and \u03f5L(L)DFA(solid)=-A(L)DFA(solid). Slater's relation \u2202E/\u2202ni = \u03f5i for local density functional approximations (LDFAs) [and Hartree-Fock (HF) and hybrids] is useful to prove these relations. The equality of LDFA orbital energies and LDFA calculated -ILDFA and -ALDFA in solids does not mean that they are good approximations to the exact quantities. The LDFA total energies of the ions with a delocalized charge are too low, hence ILDFA(solid) < I and ALDFA(solid) > A, due to the local-approximation error, also denoted delocalization error, of LDFAs in extended systems. These errors combine to make the LDFA orbital energy band gap considerably smaller than the exact fundamental gap, \u03f5LLDFA(solid)-\u03f5HLDFA(solid)=ILDFA(solid)-ALDFA(solid)<I-A (the LDFA band gap problem). These results for density functional approximations are compared to exact KS and to HF and hybrids. For the exact KS HOMO energy, one has \u03f5HKS=-I. The exact KS LUMO energy does not approximate the experimental -A (neither in molecules nor in solids), but is considerably below, which is the main reason for the exact KS HOMO-LUMO energy gap being considerably below the fundamental gap I - A (the exact KS band gap problem)."

  "description": "Predictable irreversible switching between acute and chronic inflammationMany a disease associates with inflammation. Upon binding of antigen-antibody complexes to immunoglobulin-like receptors, mast cells release tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and proteases, causing fibroblasts to release endogenous antigens that may be cross reactive with exogenous antigens. We made a predictive dynamic map of the corresponding extracellular network. In silico, this map cleared bacterial infections, via acute inflammation, but could also cause chronic inflammation. In the calculations, limited inflammation flipped to strong inflammation when cross-reacting antigen exceeded an \"On threshold.\" Subsequent reduction of the antigen load to below this \"On threshold\" did not remove the strong inflammation phenotype unless the antigen load dropped below a much lower and subtler \"Off\" threshold. In between both thresholds, the network appeared caught either in a \"low\" or a \"high\" inflammatory state. This was not simply a matter of bi-stability, however, the transition to the \"high\" state was temporarily revertible but ultimately irreversible: removing antigen after high exposure reduced the inflammatory phenotype back to \"low\" levels but if then the antigen dosage was increased only a little, the high inflammation state was already re-attained. This property may explain why the high inflammation state is indeed \"chronic,\" whereas only the naive low-inflammation state is \"acute.\" The model demonstrates that therapies of chronic inflammation such as with anti-IgLC should require fibroblast implantation (or corresponding stem cell activation) for permanence in order to redress the irreversible transition."

  "description": "Efficient Hot Electron Transfer in Quantum Dot-Sensitized Mesoporous Oxides at Room TemperatureHot carrier cooling processes represent one of the major efficiency losses in solar energy conversion. Losses associated with cooling can in principle be circumvented if hot carrier extraction toward selective contacts is faster than hot carrier cooling in the absorber (in so-called hot carrier solar cells). Previous work has demonstrated the possibility of hot electron extraction in quantum dot (QD)-sensitized systems, in particular, at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate a room-temperature hot electron transfer (HET) with up to unity quantum efficiency in strongly coupled PbS quantum dot-sensitized mesoporous SnO2. We show that the HET efficiency is determined by a kinetic competition between HET rate (KHET) and the thermalization rate (KTH) in the dots. KHET can be modulated by changing the excitation photon energy; KTH can be modified through the lattice temperature. DFT calculations demonstrate that the HET rate and efficiency are primarily determined by the density of the state (DoS) of QD and oxide. Our results provide not only a new way to achieve efficient hot electron transfer at room temperature but also new insights on the mechanism of HET and the means to control it."

Although the importance of ESX-1 secretion in virulence is well established, the characterization of its individual components and the role of individual substrates is far from complete. Here, we describe the functional characterization of the Mycobacterium marinum accessory ESX-1 proteins EccA1, EspG1and EspH, i.e. proteins that are neither substrates nor structural components. Proteomic analysis revealed that EspG1is crucial for ESX-1 secretion, since all detectable ESX-1 substrates were absent from the cell surface and culture supernatant in an espG1mutant. Deletion of eccA1resulted in minor secretion defects, but interestingly, the severity of these secretion defects was dependent on the culture conditions. Finally, espH deletion showed a partial secretion defect; whereas several ESX-1 substrates were secreted in normal amounts, secretion of EsxA and EsxB was diminished and secretion of EspE and EspF was fully blocked. Interaction studies showed that EspH binds EspE and therefore could function as a specific chaperone for this substrate. Despite the observed differences in secretion, hemolytic activity was lost in all M. marinum mutants, implying that hemolytic activity is not strictly correlated with EsxA secretion. Surprisingly, while EspH is essential for successful infection of phagocytic host cells, deletion of espH resulted in a significantly increased virulence phenotype in zebrafish larvae, linked to poor granuloma formation and extracellular outgrowth. Together, these data show that different sets of ESX-1 substrates play different roles at various steps of the infection cycle of M. marinum."

Each enantiomer of neutral Warfarin can exist in 20 possible tautomeric states leading to complex pharmacokinetics and uncertainty as to the relevant species under different conditions. Here, the ability of alternative computational approaches to predict the preferred tautomeric form(s) of neutral Warfarin in different solvents is examined. It is shown that varying the method used to estimate the heat of formation in vacuum (direct or via homodesmic reactions), whether entropic corrections were included, and the method used to estimate the free enthalpy of solvation (i.e., PCM, COSMO, or SMD implicit models or explicit solvent) lead to large differences in the predicted rank and relative populations of the tautomers. In this case, only a combination of the enthalpy of formation using homodesmic reactions and explicit solvent to estimate the free enthalpy of solvation yielded results compatible with the available experimental data. The work also suggests that a small but significant subset of the possible Warfarin tautomers are likely to be physiologically relevant."

  "description": "Probing Solvent-Ligand Interactions in Colloidal Nanocrystals by the NMR Line BroadeningAlthough solvent-ligand interactions play a major role in nanocrystal synthesis, dispersion formulation, and assembly, there is currently no direct method to study this. Here we examine the broadening of 1H NMR resonances associated with bound ligands and turn this poorly understood descriptor into a tool to assess solvent-ligand interactions. We show that the line broadening has both a homogeneous and a heterogeneous component. The former is nanocrystal-size dependent, and the latter results from solvent-ligand interactions. Our model is supported by experimental and theoretical evidence that correlates broad NMR lines with poor ligand solvation. This correlation is found across a wide range of solvents, extending from water to hexane, for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic ligand types, and for a multitude of oxide, sulfide, and selenide nanocrystals. Our findings thus put forward NMR line-shape analysis as an indispensable tool to form, investigate, and manipulate nanocolloids."

  "description": "The probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus for alleviation of helicobacter pylori-associated gastric pathology in East AfricaThe probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) can play a role in establishing a harmless relationship with Helicobacter pylori and reduce gastric pathology in East African populations. H. pylori has the ability to inhabit the surface of the mucous layer of the human stomach and duodenum. In the developing world, an estimated 51% of the population is carrier of H. pylori, while in some Western countries these numbers dropped below 20%, which is probably associated with improved sanitation and smaller family sizes. Colonization by H. pylori can be followed by inflammation of the gastric mucus layer, and is a risk factor in the development of atrophic gastritis, peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Notwithstanding the higher prevalence of H. pylori carriers in developing countries, no equal overall increase in gastric pathology is found. This has been attributed to a less pro-inflammatory immune response to H. pylori in African compared to Caucasian populations. In addition, a relatively low exposure to other risk factors in certain African populations may play a role, including the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, smoking, and diets without certain protective factors. A novel approach to the reduction of H. pylori associated gastric pathology is found in the administration of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 (LRY), the generic variant of LGG. This gastro-intestinal isolate inhibits H. pylori by competition for substrate and binding sites as well as production of antimicrobial compounds such as lactic acid. In addition, it attenuates the host's H. pylori-induced apoptosis and inflammation responses and stimulates angiogenesis in the gastric and duodenal epithelium. The probiotic LRY is not able to eradicate H. pylori completely, but its co-supplementation in antibiotic eradication therapy has been shown to relieve side effects of this therapy. In Uganda, unlike other African countries, gastric pathology is relatively common, presumably resulting from the lack of dietary protective factors in the traditional diet. Supplementation with LRY through local production of probiotic yogurt, could be a solution to establish a harmless relationship with H. pylori and reduce gastric pathology and subsequent eradication therapy treatment."

  "description": "Online screening of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in natural products using monolith-based immobilized capillary enzyme reactors combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometryIn order to develop a direct and reliable method for discovering lead compounds from traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), a comparative online ligand fishing platform was developed using immobilized capillary enzyme reactors (ICERs) in combination with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS). Methacrylate-based monolithic capillaries (400 \u03bcm I.D. \u00d7 10 cm) containing epoxy reactive groups were used as support to immobilize the target enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The activity and kinetic parameters of the AChE-ICER were investigated using micro-LC-UV. Subsequently, ligand fishing and identification from mixtures was carried out using the complete AChE-ICER-LC\u2013MS platform. For efficient distinction of true actives from false positives, highly automated comparative analyses were run alternatingly using AChE-ICERs and negative control-ICERs, both online installed in the system. After washing unbound compounds to the waste, bound ligands were eluted from the AChE-ICER to a trapping loop using a denaturing solution. The trapped ligands were further separated and identified using LC\u2013MS. Non-specific binding to the monolith support or non-functional sites of the immobilized enzyme was investigated by exposing analytes to the negative control-ICER. The specificity of the proposed approach was verified by analyzing a known AChE inhibitor in the presence of an inactive compound. The platform was applied to screen for AChE inhibitors in extracts of Corydalis yanhusuo. Eight compounds (columbamine, jatrorrhizine, coptisine, palmatine, berberine, dehydrocorydaline, tetrahydropalmatine and corydaline) with AChE binding affinity were detected and identified, and their AChE inhibitory activities were further verified by an in vitro enzymatic inhibition assay. Experimental results show that the proposed comparative online ligand fishing platform is suitable for rapid screening and mass-selective detection of AChE inhibitors in complex mixtures."

  "description": "The influence of knowledge flow on sustainable innovation in a project-based industry: From demonstration to limited adoption of eco-innovationsThe effect of the flow of knowledge on sustainable innovation in project-based firms in project-based industries is the subject of in-depth research in this paper. It studies the simultaneous functioning and effects of knowledge flow mechanisms on sustainable innovation in project-based firms in project-based industries; industries like the construction-, film-, game-, consultancy-, and IT-industry. To this end, a retrospective case study, covering 20 years (1989\u20132008) of sustainable innovation in the Dutch house-building industry, is conducted. This study finds that bundles of knowledge flow mechanisms stimulate both sustainable innovation creation by small networks of innovative firms that cooperate in demonstration projects, as well as stimulates a limited adoption of some of these created sustainable innovations by networks of larger incumbent firms outside these demonstration projects. Based on this finding the paper proposes a model and related propositions. To scholars it can serve as a basis for future research that further explores and tests the effect of the flow of knowledge on the eco-innovativeness of industries that heavily rely on projects. The findings can also be of benefit for policy and business practitioners in and around project-based industries. To them it can provide a route for getting sustainable innovations applied on a larger scale, from demonstration projects to regular projects."

In this work, we theoretically and experimentally examine the Pauson-Khand reaction (PKR) on zig-zag, armchair, and chiral single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Our benchmarked density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that an alternative pathway to the widely accepted Magnus reaction pathway has significantly lower energy barriers, thus suggesting the use of this alternative pathway to predict whether a PKR on SWCNTs is favored or hampered. Accessible energy barriers of up to 16 kcal mol\u22121 are estimated and our results suggest that semiconducting SWCNTs react faster than metallic ones, although both types can be functionalized. Guided by our theoretical predictions, cyclopentenones are successfully attached to SWCNTs by heating and are, subsequently, characterized in the laboratory."

Thus far, macrocyclization approaches utilize a very limited structural diversity, which complicates the design process. Herein, we report an approach that enables cyclization through the installation of modular crosslinks into native proteins composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Our stabilization procedure involves the introduction of three surface-exposed cysteine residues, which are reacted with a triselectrophile, resulting in the in situ cyclization of the protein (INCYPRO). A bicyclic version of sortase A was designed that exhibits increased tolerance towards thermal as well as chemical denaturation, and proved to be efficient in protein labeling under denaturing conditions. In addition, we applied INCYPRO to the KIX domain, resulting in up to 24 \u00b0C increased thermal stability."

  "description": "Ample arsenite bio-oxidation activity in Bangladesh drinking water wells: A bonanza for bioremediation?Millions of people worldwide are at risk of arsenic poisoning from their drinking water. In Bangladesh the problem extends to rural drinking water wells, where non-biological solutions are not feasible. In serial enrichment cultures of water from various Bangladesh drinking water wells, we found transfer-persistent arsenite oxidation activity under four conditions (aerobic/anaerobic; heterotrophic/autotrophic). This suggests that biological decontamination may help ameliorate the problem. The enriched microbial communities were phylogenetically at least as diverse as the unenriched communities: they contained a bonanza of 16S rRNA gene sequences. These related to Hydrogenophaga, Acinetobacter, Dechloromonas, Comamonas, and Rhizobium/Agrobacterium species. In addition, the enriched microbiomes contained genes highly similar to the arsenite oxidase (aioA) gene of chemolithoautotrophic (e.g., Paracoccus sp. SY) and heterotrophic arsenite-oxidizing strains. The enriched cultures also contained aioA phylotypes not detected in the previous survey of uncultivated samples from the same wells. Anaerobic enrichments disclosed a wider diversity of arsenite oxidizing aioA phylotypes than did aerobic enrichments. The cultivatable chemolithoautotrophic and heterotrophic arsenite oxidizers are of great interest for future in or ex-situ arsenic bioremediation technologies for the detoxification of drinking water by oxidizing arsenite to arsenate that should then precipitates with iron oxides.

  "description": "Vanishing white matter: deregulated integrated stress response as therapy targetObjective: Vanishing white matter (VWM) is a fatal, stress-sensitive leukodystrophy that mainly affects children and is currently without treatment. VWM is caused by recessive mutations in eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) that is crucial for initiation of mRNA translation and its regulation during the integrated stress response (ISR). Mutations reduce eIF2B activity. VWM pathomechanisms remain unclear. In contrast with the housekeeping function of eIF2B, astrocytes are selectively affected in VWM. One study objective was to test our hypothesis that in the brain translation of specific mRNAs is altered by eIF2B mutations, impacting primarily astrocytes. The second objective was to investigate whether modulation of eIF2B activity could ameliorate this altered translation and improve the disease. Methods: Mice with biallelic missense mutations in eIF2B that recapitulate human VWM were used to screen for mRNAs with altered translation in brain using polysomal profiling. Findings were verified in brain tissue from VWM patients using qPCR and immunohistochemistry. The compound ISRIB (for \u201cISR inhibitor\u201d) was administered to VWM mice to increase eIF2B activity. Its effect on translation, neuropathology, and clinical signs was assessed. Results: In brains of VWM compared to wild-type mice we observed the most prominent changes in translation concerning ISR mRNAs; their expression levels correlated with disease severity. We substantiated these findings in VWM patients\u2019 brains. ISRIB normalized expression of mRNA markers, ameliorated brain white matter pathology and improved motor skills in VWM mice. Interpretation: The present findings show that ISR deregulation is central in VWM pathomechanisms and a viable target for therapy."

  "description": "Application of three approaches for quantitative AOP development to renal toxicityWhile hazard assessment of chemicals can make direct use of descriptive adverse outcome pathways (AOPs), risk assessment requires quantitative relationships from exposure to effect timing and magnitude. To seamlessly integrate the data generated by alternative methods or in vivo testing, quantitative AOPs (qAOPs) providing dose-time-response predictions are more valuable than qualitative AOPs. Here, we compare three approaches to qAOP building: empirical dose-response modeling, Bayesian network (BN) calibration, and systems biology (SB) modeling. These methods were applied to the quantification of a simplified oxidative stress induced chronic kidney disease AOP, on the basis of in vitro data obtained on RPTEC/TERT1 cells exposed to potassium bromate. Effectopedia was used to store the experimental data and the developed models in a unified representation so they can be compared and further analyzed. We argue that despite the fact that dose-response models give adequate fits to the data they should be accompanied by mechanistic SB modeling to gain a proper perspective on the quantification. BNs can be both more precise than dose-response models and simpler than SB models, but more experience with their usage is needed."

  "description": "Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer based G protein-activation assay to probe duration of antagonism at the histamine H3 receptorDuration of receptor antagonism, measured as the recovery of agonist responsiveness, is gaining attention as a method to evaluate the \u2018effective\u2019 target-residence for antagonists. These functional assays might be a good alternative for kinetic binding assays in competition with radiolabeled or fluorescent ligands, as they are performed on intact cells and better reflect consequences of dynamic cellular processes on duration of receptor antagonism. Here, we used a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assay that monitors heterotrimeric G protein activation via scavenging of released Venus-G\u03b21\u03b32 by NanoLuc (Nluc)-tagged membrane-associated-C-terminal fragment of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 3 (masGRK3ct-Nluc) as a tool to probe duration of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) antagonism. The G\u03b1i-coupled histamine H3 receptor (H3R) was used in this study as prolonged antagonism is associated with adverse events (e.g., insomnia) and consequently, short-residence time ligands might be preferred. Due to its fast and prolonged response, this assay can be used to determine the duration of functional antagonism by measuring the recovery of agonist responsiveness upon washout of pre-bound antagonist, and to assess antagonist re-equilibration time via Schild-plot analysis. Re-equilibration of pre-incubated antagonist with agonist and receptor could be followed in time to monitor the transition from insurmountable to surmountable antagonism. The BRET-based G protein activation assay can detect differences in the recovery of H3R responsiveness and re-equilibration of pre-bound antagonists between the tested H3R antagonists. Fast dissociation kinetics were observed for marketed drug pitolisant (Wakix\u00ae) in this assay, which suggests that short residence time might be beneficial for therapeutic targeting of the H3R."

  "description": "Evaluation of Luminogenic Substrates as Probe Substrates for Bacterial Cytochrome P450 Enzymes: Application to Mycobacterium tuberculosisSeveral cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) encoded in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are considered potential new drug targets due to the essential roles they play in bacterial viability and in the establishment of chronic intracellular infection. Identification of inhibitors of Mtb CYPs at present is conducted by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) optical titration experiments or by metabolism studies using endogenous substrates, such as cholesterol and lanosterol. The first technique requires high enzyme concentrations and volumes, while analysis of steroid hydroxylation is dependent on low-throughput analytical methods. Luciferin-based luminogenic substrates have proven to be very sensitive substrates for the high-throughput profiling of inhibitors of human CYPs. In the present study, 17 pro-luciferins were evaluated as substrates for Mtb CYP121A1, CYP124A1, CYP125A1, CYP130A1, and CYP142A1. Luciferin-BE was identified as an excellent probe substrate for CYP130A1, resulting in a high luminescence yield after addition of luciferase and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Its applicability for high-throughput screening was supported by a high Z\u2019-factor and high signal-to-background ratio. Using this substrate, the inhibitory properties of a selection of known inhibitors could be characterized using significantly less protein concentration when compared to UV-vis optical titration experiments. Although several luminogenic substrates were also identified for CYP121A1, CYP124A1, CYP125A1, and CYP142A1, their relatively low yield of luminescence and low signal-to-background ratios make them less suitable for high-throughput screening since high enzyme concentrations will be needed. Further structural optimization of luminogenic substrates will be necessary to obtain more sensitive probe substrates for these Mtb CYPs."

  "description": "Interrogating the essential bacterial cell division protein FtsQ with fragments using target immobilized NMR screening (TINS)The divisome is a large protein complex that regulates bacterial cell division and therefore represents an attractive target for novel antibacterial drugs. In this study, we report on the ligandability of FtsQ, which is considered a key component of the divisome. For this, the soluble periplasmic domain of Escherichia coli FtsQ was immobilized and used to screen a library of 1501 low molecular weight (< 300 Da), synthetic compounds for those that interact with the protein. A primary screen was performed using target immobilized NMR screening (TINS) and yielded 72 hits. Subsequently, these hits were validated in an orthogonal assay. At first, we aimed to do this using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), but the lack of positive control hampered optimization of the experiment. Alternatively, a two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum of FtsQ was obtained and used to validate these hits by chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments. This resulted in the identification of three fragments with weak affinity for the periplasmic domain of FtsQ, arguing that the ligandability of FtsQ is low. While this indicates that developing high affinity ligands for FtsQ is far from straightforward, the identified hit fragments can help to further interrogate FtsQ interactions."

  "description": "The autism- and schizophrenia-associated protein CYFIP1 regulates bilateral brain connectivity and behaviourCopy-number variants of the CYFIP1 gene in humans have been linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia(SCZ), two neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by defects in brain connectivity. Here, we show that CYFIP1 plays an important role in brain functional connectivity and callosal functions. We find that Cyfip1-heterozygous mice have reduced functional connectivity and defects in white matter architecture, similar to phenotypes found in patients with ASD, SCZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Cyfip1-deficient mice also present decreased myelination in the callosal axons, altered presynaptic function, and impaired bilateral connectivity. Finally, Cyfip1 deficiency leads to abnormalities in motor coordination, sensorimotor gating and sensory perception, which are also known neuropsychiatric disorder-related symptoms. These results show that Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency compromises brain connectivity and function, which might explain its genetic association to neuropsychiatric disorders."

  "description": "A systematic assessment of current genome-scale metabolic reconstruction toolsBackground: Several genome-scale metabolic reconstruction software platforms have been developed and are being continuously updated. These tools have been widely applied to reconstruct metabolic models for hundreds of microorganisms ranging from important human pathogens to species of industrial relevance. However, these platforms, as yet, have not been systematically evaluated with respect to software quality, best potential uses and intrinsic capacity to generate high-quality, genome-scale metabolic models. It is therefore unclear for potential users which tool best fits the purpose of their research. Results: In this work, we perform a systematic assessment of current genome-scale reconstruction software platforms. To meet our goal, we first define a list of features for assessing software quality related to genome-scale reconstruction. Subsequently, we use the feature list to evaluate the performance of each tool. To assess the similarity of the draft reconstructions to high-quality models, we compare each tool's output networks with that of the high-quality, manually curated, models of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bordetella pertussis, representatives of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. We additionally compare draft reconstructions with a model of Pseudomonas putida to further confirm our findings. We show that none of the tools outperforms the others in all the defined features. Conclusions: Model builders should carefully choose a tool (or combinations of tools) depending on the intended use of the metabolic model. They can use this benchmark study as a guide to select the best tool for their research. Finally, developers can also benefit from this evaluation by getting feedback to improve their software."

  "description": "The Effects of Sindbis Viral Vectors on Neuronal FunctionViral vectors are attractive tools to express genes in neurons. Transduction of neurons with a recombinant, replication-deficient Sindbis viral vector is a method of choice for studying the effects of short-term protein overexpression on neuronal function. However, to which extent Sindbis by itself may affect neurons is not fully understood. We assessed effects of neuronal transduction with a Sindbis viral vector on the transcriptome and proteome in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, and analyzed the electrophysiological properties of individual CA1 neurons, at 24 h and 72 h after viral vector injection. Whereas Sindbis caused substantial gene expression alterations, changes at the protein level were less pronounced. Alterations in transcriptome and proteome were predominantly limited to proteins involved in mediating anti-viral innate immune responses. Sindbis transduction did not affect the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of individual neurons: the membrane potential and neuronal excitability were similar between transduced and non-transduced CA1 neurons up to 72 h after Sindbis injection. Synaptic currents also remained unchanged upon Sindbis transduction, unless slices were massively infected for 72 h. We conclude that Sindbis viral vectors at low transduction rates are suitable for studying short-term effects of a protein of interest on electrophysiological properties of neurons, but not for studies on the regulation of gene expression."

Their photoluminescence (PL) was characterized by a large Stokes shift, and the PL quantum yield increased with the amount of Na up to \u223c22% for the Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6InCl6 stoichiometry. The presence of Bi3+ dopants was crucial to achieve high PL quantum yields (PLQYs) as nondoped NC systems were not emissive. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the substitution of Ag+ with Na+ leads to localization of AgCl6 energy levels above the valence band maximum, whereas doping with Bi3+ creates BiCl6 states below the conduction band minimum. As such, the PL emission stems from trapped emission between states localized in the BiCl6 and AgCl6 octahedra, respectively. Our findings indicated that both the partial replacement of Ag+ with Na+ ions and doping with Bi3+ cations are essential in order to optimize the PL emission of these systems."

Like typical recombinant IgG-based therapeutics, atacicept is a glycoprotein whose glycosylation-related heterogeneity arises from the glycosylation-site localization, site-specific occupation and structural diversity of the attached glycans. Here, we present a first comprehensive site-specific N- and O-glycosylation characterization of atacicept using mass spectrometry-based workflows. First, N- and O-glycosylation sites and their corresponding glycoforms were identified. Second, a relative quantitation of the N-glycosylation site microheterogeneity was achieved by glycopeptide analysis, which was further supported by analysis of the released N-glycans. We confirmed the presence of one N-glycosylation site, carrying 47 glycoforms covering 34 different compositions, next to two hinge region O-glycosylation sites with core 1-type glycans. The relative O-glycan distribution was analyzed based on the de-N-glycosylated intact protein species. Overall, N- and O-glycosylation were consistent between two individual production batches."

Miniaturization of such screening systems may overcome problems associated with small sample volumes and enhance throughput and sensitivity. Here we present a new screening platform, coined picofractionation analytics, which encompasses microarray bioassays and mass spectrometry (MS) of components from minute amounts of samples after their nano liquid chromatographic (nanoLC) separation. Herein, nanoLC was coupled to a low-volume liquid dispenser equipped with pressure-fed solenoid valves, enabling 50-nL volumes of column effluent (300 nL/min) to be discretely deposited on a glass slide. The resulting fractions were dried and subsequently bioassayed by sequential printing of nL-volumes of reagents on top of the spots. Unwanted evaporation of bioassay liquids was circumvented by employing mineral oil droplets. A fluorescence microscope was used for assay readout in kinetic mode. Bioassay data were correlated to MS data obtained using the same nanoLC conditions in order to assign bioactives. The platform provides the possibility of freely choosing a wide diversity of bioassay formats, including those requiring long incubation times. The new method was compared to a standard bioassay approach, and its applicability was demonstrated by screening plasmin inhibitors and fibrinolytic bioactives from mixtures of standards and snake venoms, revealing active peptides and coagulopathic proteases."

  "description": "Towards the integrated marine debris observing systemPlastics and other artificial materials pose new risks to health of the ocean. Anthropogenic debris travels across large distances and is ubiquitous in the water and on the shorelines, yet, observations of its sources, composition, pathways and distributions in the ocean are very sparse and inaccurate. Total amounts of plastics and other man-made debris in the ocean and on the shore, temporal trends in these amounts under exponentially increasing production, as well as degradation processes, vertical fluxes and time scales are largely unknown. Present ocean circulation models are not able to accurately simulate drift of debris because of its complex hydrodynamics. In this paper we discuss the structure of the future integrated marine debris observing system (IMDOS) that is required to provide long-term monitoring of the state of the anthropogenic pollution and support operational activities to mitigate impacts on the ecosystem and safety of maritime activity. The proposed observing system integrates remote sensing and in situ observations. Also, models are used to optimize the design of the system and, in turn, they will be gradually improved using the products of the system. Remote sensing technologies will provide spatially coherent coverage and consistent surveying time series at local to global scale. Optical sensors, including high-resolution imaging, multi- and hyperspectral, fluorescence, and Raman technologies, as well as SAR will be used to measure different types of debris. They will be implemented in a variety of platforms, from hand-held tools to ship-, buoy-, aircraft-, and satellite-based sensors. A network of in situ observations, including reports from volunteers, citizen scientists and ships of opportunity, will be developed to provide data for calibration/validation of remote sensors and to monitor the spread of plastic pollution and other marine debris. IMDOS will interact with other observing systems monitoring physical, chemical, and biological processes in the ocean and on shorelines as well as state of the ecosystem, maritime activities and safety, drift of sea ice, etc. The synthesized data will support innovative multi-disciplinary research and serve diverse community of users."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower than S-EDCs. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

  "description": "Multiparametric assessment of mitochondrial respiratory inhibition in HepG2 and RPTEC/TERT1 cells using a panel of mitochondrial targeting agrochemicalsEvidence is mounting for the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in several pathologies including metabolic diseases, accelerated ageing, neurodegenerative diseases and in certain xenobiotic-induced organ toxicity. Assessing mitochondrial perturbations is not trivial and the outcomes of such investigations are dependent on the cell types used and assays employed. Here we systematically investigated the effect of electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors on multiple mitochondrial-related parameters in two human cell types, HepG2 and RPTEC/TERT1. Cells were exposed to a broad range of concentrations of 20 ETC-inhibiting agrochemicals and capsaicin, consisting of inhibitors of NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I, CI), succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II, CII) and cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III, CIII). A battery of tests was utilised, including viability assays, lactate production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the Seahorse bioanalyser, which simultaneously measures extracellular acidification rate [ECAR] and oxygen consumption rate [OCR]. CI inhibitors caused a potent decrease in OCR, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ECAR and increased lactate production in both cell types. Twenty-fourhour exposure to CI inhibitors decreased viability of RPTEC/TERT1 cells and 3D spheroid-cultured HepG2 cells in the presence of glucose. CI inhibitors decreased 2D HepG2 viability only in the absence of glucose. CII inhibitors had no notable effects in intact cells up to 10 \u00b5M. CIII inhibitors had similar effects to the CI inhibitors. Antimycin A was the most potent CIII inhibitor, with activity in the nanomolar range. The proposed CIII inhibitor cyazofamid demonstrated a mitochondrial uncoupling signal in both cell types. The study presents a comprehensive example of a mitochondrial assessment workflow and establishes measurable key events of ETC inhibition."

  "description": "Toddler behavior, the home environment, and flame retardant exposureToddlers are at increased risk of dust ingestion and subsequently flame retardant (FR) exposure because they often play close to the floor and mouth hands and objects. Exposure to some FRs have been associated to endocrine disruption and neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous research has shown higher FR concentrations in toddlers\u2019 serum and urine, but which toddler-behaviors influence exposure levels remains to be determined. We investigated how toddler-behaviors are associated to FRs in hand wipes (HWs) and saliva. Fifty 8-18 month-old children from the Linking EDCs in maternal Nutrition to Child health study, were visited at home. The child's behavior was observed and assessed using a questionnaire. Hand-to-object behavior frequency was associated with HW tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), tris(phenyl) phosphate, tris(methylphenyl) phosphate, and resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) levels above the detection limit. Children playing with electronics multiple times per week had higher TDCIPP HW levels compared to children playing with electronics once per month or never (p = 0.032 and p = 0.046). Frequent mouth-to-object and frequent mouthing a pacifier were associated with lower TDCIPP (p = 0.019) and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) HW levels, respectively (p = 0.002\u20130.019). Exposure estimates based on hand-to-mouth behavior did not exceed the available reference doses. This is the first study investigating toddler-behavior in relation to FR hand loadings. Although a range of behaviors was investigated, only a few showed a relation with FR HW levels, suggesting that toddler-behavior might not alone be responsible for the elevated FR levels in children. It is therefore important to explore other pathways including dermal absorption and inhalation."

To this end, the effect of different donor and \u03c0-bridge moieties on the energy gaps between local and charge-transfer singlet and triplet states is examined. To prove this computationally aided design concept, the D-\u03c0-B(FXyl)2 compounds 1\u20135 were synthesized and fully characterized. The photophysical properties of these compounds in various solvents, polymeric film, and in a frozen matrix were investigated in detail and show excellent agreement with the computationally obtained data. Furthermore, a simple structure\u2013property relationship is presented on the basis of the molecular fragment orbitals of the donor and the \u03c0-bridge, which minimize the relevant singlet\u2013triplet gaps to achieve efficient TADF emitters."

Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) and solid phase extraction (SPE) methods were used for the vegetables and water, respectively. In 2.5% of the tomato samples, profenofos was detected above European maximum residue limits (MRLs), in 12.5% of the samples metalaxyl, and in 2.5% \u03b1- and \u03b2-endosulfan. In 5% of the onion samples, profenofos was detected above European MRLs, in 7.5% of the onion samples metalaxyl, and in 5% \u03bb-cyhalothrin. In surface water, profenofos was detected at the highest concentration of 2300 \u03bcg/L in the Bulbula River, 890 \u03bcg/L near the agricultural land north of Lake Ziway (ANLZ-1), 1700 \u03bcg/L in the floriculture effluent (FE-1), and 900 \u03bcg/L in tap water at the Batu Drinking Water (BDW) supply. These results show that the levels of pesticides are in several cases substantially elevated, and emphasize the need of regular pesticide monitoring programs for surface waters and vegetables in the Ethiopian CRV."

  "description": "SBML Level 3: an extensible format for the exchange and reuse of biological modelsSystems biology has experienced dramatic growth in the number, size, and complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and reuse models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint-based models, reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution."

  "description": "Local Enhancement of Dynamic Correlation in Excited States: Fresh Perspective on Ionicity and Development of Correlation Density Functional Approximation Based on the On-Top Pair DensityWe discuss the interplay between the nondynamic and dynamic electron correlation in excited states from the perspective of the suppression of dynamic correlation (SDC) and enhancement of dynamic correlation (EDC) effects. We reveal that there exists a connection between the ionic character of a wave function and EDC. Following this finding we introduce a quantitative measure of ionicity based solely on local functions without referring to valence bond models. The ability to recognize both the SDC and EDC regions underlies the presented method, named CAS\u03a0DFT, combining complete active space (CAS) wave function and density functional theory (DFT) via the on-top pair density (\u03a0) function. We extend this approach to excited states by devising an improved representation of the EDC effect in the correlation functional. The generalized CAS\u03a0DFT uses different DFT functionals for ground and excited states. Numerical demonstration for singlet \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0* excitations shows that CAS\u03a0DFT offers satisfactory accuracy at a fraction of the cost of the ab initio approaches."

Although nuclear-encoded mRNAs can be localized to the mitochondrial surface, the importance of this localization is unclear. As yeast switch to respiratory metabolism, there is an increase in the fraction of the cytoplasm that is mitochondrial. Our data point to this change in mitochondrial volume fraction increasing the localization of certain nuclear-encoded mRNAs to the surface of the mitochondria. We show that mitochondrial mRNA localization is necessary and sufficient to increase protein production to levels required during respiratory growth. Furthermore, we find that ribosome stalling impacts mRNA sensitivity to mitochondrial volume fraction and counterintuitively leads to enhanced protein synthesis by increasing mRNA localization to mitochondria. This points to a mechanism by which cells are able to use translation elongation and the geometric constraints of the cell to fine-tune organelle-specific gene expression through mRNA localization."

The sensitivity of eight pre-selected bacterial strains were tested to a training set of ten antibiotics, i.e. three Gram+ Bacillus subtilis strains with different read-outs, and five Gram\u2212 strains. The latter group consisted of a bioluminescent Allivibrio fischeri strain and four Escherichia coli strains, i.e. a wild type (WT) and three strains with a modified cell envelope to increase their sensitivity. The WT B. subtilis and an E. coli strain newly developed in this study, were most sensitive to the training set. This E. coli strain carries an open variant of an outer membrane protein combined with an inactivated multidrug efflux transport system. The assay conditions of these two strains were optimized and validated by exposure to a validation set of thirteen antibiotics with clinical and environmental relevance. The assay sensitivity ranged from the ng/mL to \u03bcg/mL range. The applicability of the assays for toxicological characterization of aquatic environmental samples was demonstrated for hospital effluent extract. A future application includes effect-directed analysis to identify yet unknown antibiotic contaminants or their transformation products."

  "description": "Electronic Structure Engineering Achieved via Organic Ligands in Silicon NanocrystalsA class of important semiconductors, such as Si, Ge, or C, has an indirect band gap, which critically limits their optical properties. Lack of efficient emission is especially unfortunate for silicon, where Si light sources could enable realization of the long-awaited on-chip-integrated Si laser for an integrated optical computing CPU architecture. Hence, methods toward the improvement of optical properties of Si-based materials are in high demand. Unlike most of the applied light-emitting semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) with a direct band gap, the radiative rate in covalent silicon NCs (SiNCs) is size-dependent but remains low even for the smallest SiNCs. Additionally, the radiative rate is also ligand-sensitive, and the covalent bond with ligands is very rigid and static and could be, in principle, used for straining via steric hindrance, further influencing the radiative rates. In this work, we use the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) simulation together with a \"fuzzy\"band-structure concept to show the effect of covalently bonded ligands on the electronic structure of NCs and their k - -space projection. For instance, in 2 nm large SiNCs with C-linked organic ligands, we demonstrate that radiative rates can be manipulated by ligands to a considerable extent through an intricate interplay between charge transfer from the core to the ligand, orbital delocalization, and strain by steric hindrance. We propose that the tunability of electronic properties achieved via ligands in covalent systems offers a possible direction toward the design of an ideal Si light-emitting system."

Experiments found the axial coordination of nitrogenous bases to nickel(II) porphyrins to be strongly favored by electron-withdrawing substituents such as perfluorophenyls at the meso carbon positions. Careful analysis of the electronic structure reveals that the natural explanation in terms of density change of the nickel(II) porphyrin system (in particular the metal), does not apply. Electron density changes, by the assumed inductive or polarizing effects on the metal or on the porphyrin ring system, are slight. The effect is caused by a remarkable through-space electric field effect on the metalloporphyrin system, originating from the charge distribution inside the perfluorphenyl groups (mostly the C-F dipoles).

  "description": "Efficacy of Novel Pyrazolone Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors in Experimental Mouse Models of Trypanosoma cruziPyrazolones are heterocyclic compounds with interesting biological properties. Some derivatives inhibit phosphodiesterases (PDEs) and thereby increase the cellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which plays a vital role in the control of metabolism in eukaryotic cells, including the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease (CD), a major neglected tropical disease. In vitro phenotypic screening identified a 4-bromophenyl-dihydropyrazole dimer as an anti-T. cruzi hit and 17 novel pyrazolone analogues with variations on the phenyl ring were investigated in a panel of phenotypic laboratory models. Potent activity against the intracellular forms (Tulahuen and Y strains) was obtained with 50% effective concentration (EC50) values within the 0.17 to 3.3\u2009\u03bcM range. Although most were not active against bloodstream trypomastigotes, an altered morphology and loss of infectivity were observed. Pretreatment of the mammalian host cells with pyrazolones did not interfere with infection and proliferation, showing that the drug activity was not the result of changes to host cell metabolism. The pyrazolone NPD-227 increased the intracellular cAMP levels and was able to sterilize T. cruzi-infected cell cultures. Thus, due to its high potency and selectivity in vitro, and its additive interaction with benznidazole (Bz), NPD-227 was next assessed in the acute mouse model. Oral dosing for 5\u2009days of NPD-227 at 10\u2009mg/kg + Bz at 10\u2009mg/kg not only reduced parasitemia (>87%) but also protected against mortality (>83% survival), hence demonstrating superiority to the monotherapy schemes. These data support these pyrazolone molecules as potential novel therapeutic alternatives for Chagas disease."

  "description": "MS-Based Allotype-Specific Analysis of Polyclonal IgG-Fc N-GlycosylationCurrent approaches to study glycosylation of polyclonal human immunoglobulins G (IgG) usually imply protein digestion or glycan release. While these approaches allow in-depth characterization, they also result in a loss of valuable information regarding certain subclasses, allotypes and co-occuring post-translational modifications (PTMs). Unfortunately, the high variability of polyclonal IgGs makes their intact mass spectrometry (MS) analysis extremely challenging. We propose here a middle-up strategy for the analysis of the intact fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of human plasma IgGs, with the aim of acquiring integrated information of the N-glycosylation and other PTMs of subclasses and allotypes. Human plasma IgG was isolated using Fc-specific beads followed by an on-bead CH2 domain digestion with the enzyme IdeS. The obtained mixture of Fc subunits was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) hyphenated with MS. CE-MS provided separation of different IgG-subclasses and allotypes, while HILIC-MS allowed resolution of the different glycoforms and their oxidized variants. The orthogonality of these techniques was key to reliably assign Fc allotypes. Five individual donors were analyzed using this approach. Heterozygosis was observed in all the analyzed donors resulting in a total of 12 allotypes identified. The assignments were further confirmed using recombinant monoclonal IgG allotypes as standards. While the glycosylation patterns were similar within allotypes of the same subclass, clear differences were observed between IgG subclasses and donors, highlighting the relevance of the proposed approach. In a single analysis, glycosylation levels specific for each allotype, relative abundances of subclasses and information on co-occurring modifications are obtained. This middle-up method represents an important step toward a comprehensive analysis of immunoglobulin G-Fc variants."

Simple iminium catalysts accelerate the Diels-Alder reactions by lowering the reaction barrier up to 20 kcal mol-1 compared to the parent aldehyde and imine reactions. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that the iminium catalysts enhance the reactivity by reducing the steric (Pauli) repulsion between the diene and dienophile, which originates from both a more asynchronous reaction mode and a more significant polarization of the \u03c0-system away from the incoming diene compared to aldehyde and imine analogs. Notably, we establish that the driving force behind the asynchronicity of the herein studied Diels-Alder reactions is the relief of destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion and not the orbital interaction between the terminal carbon of the dienophile and the diene, which is the widely accepted rationale."

This receptor, expressed both during lytic replication and viral latency, is required for latency. US28 is binding to a wide variety of chemokines but also exhibits a particularly high constitutive activity robustly modulating a wide network of cellular pathways altering the host cell environment to benefit HCMV infection. Several studies suggest that US28-mediated signalling may contribute to cancer progression. In this review, we discuss the unique structural characteristics that US28 acquired through evolution that confer a robust constitutive activity to this viral receptor. We also describe the wide downstream signalling network activated by this constitutive activation of US28 and discuss how these signalling pathways may promote and support important cellular aspects of cancer."

  "description": "Vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy for probing the expression of chirality in mechanically planar chiral rotaxanesMechanically interlocked molecules can exhibit molecular chirality that arises due to the mechanical bond rather than covalent stereogenic units. Developing applications of such systems is made challenging by the absence of techniques for assigning the absolute configuration of products and methods to probe how the mechanical stereogenic unit influences the spatial arrangements of the functional groups in solution. Here we demonstrate for the first time that Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) can be used to not only discriminate between mechanical stereoisomers but also provide detailed information on their (co)conformations. The latter is particularly important as these molecules are now under investigation in catalysis and sensing, both of which rely on the solution phase shape of the interlocked structure. Detailed analysis of the VCD spectra shows that, although many of the signals arise from coupled oscillators isolated in the covalent sub-components, intercomponent coupling between the macrocycle and axle gives rise to several VCD bands.

  "description": "A centrifugation-based clearing method allows high-throughput acidification and growth-rate measurements in milkThe turbidity of milk prohibits the use of optical density measurements for strain characterizations. This often limits research to laboratory media. Here, we cleared milk through centrifugation to remove insoluble milk solids. This resulted in a clear liquid phase, termed milk serum, in which optical density measurements can be used to track microbial growth until a pH of 5.2 is reached. At pH 5.2 coagulation of the soluble protein occurs, making the medium opaque again. We found that behavior in milk serum was predictive of that in milk for 39 Lactococcus lactis (R2 = 0.81) and to a lesser extent for 42 Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (formerly Lactobacillus plantarum; R2 = 0.49) strains. Hence, milk serum can be used as an optically clear alternative to milk for comparison of microbial growth and metabolic characteristics. Characterization of the growth rate, specific acidification rate for optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm, and the amount of acid produced per unit of biomass for all these strains in milk serum, showed that almost all strains could grow in milk, with higher specific acidification and growth rates of Lc. lactis strains compared with Lb. plantarum strains. Nondairy Lc. lactis isolates had a lower growth and specific acidification rate than dairy isolates. The amount of acid produced per unit biomass was relatively high and similar for Lc. lactis dairy and nondairy isolates, as opposed to Lb. plantarum isolates. Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis showed slightly lower growth and acidification rates when compared with ssp. cremoris. For Lc. lactis strains a doubling of the specific acidification rate occurred with a doubling of the maximum growth rate. This relation was not found for Lb. plantarum strains, where the acidification rate remained relatively constant across 39 strains with growth rates ranging from 0.2 h\u22121 to 0.3 h\u22121. We conclude that milk serum is a valuable alternative to milk for high-throughput strain characterization during milk fermentation."

  "description": "Analysis of recycled rubber: Development of an analytical method and determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic compounds in rubber matricesRecycled crumb rubber (CR) is rich in compounds with unrecognized toxic potency; this study aims at the development of an analytical method that would allow identification and quantification of a very wide range of organic compounds extractable from the complex rubber matrix. The analytical set-up includes target analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and methyl-PAHs and suspect screening of raw extracts to tentatively identify primary organic compounds present, but not included in the standard target analysis of recycled rubber, followed by analytical method development and target analysis of identified compounds. Analyzed samples included weathered and new CR originating from football turf granulates, rubber mats, and end-of-life car tires (ELTs). The developed analytical method involves sonication extraction, followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) fractionation that enables simple and efficient separation of analytes with broad polarity scale. The application of SPE fractionation resolves coelution problems and simplifies the chromatograms. This analytical approach allowed to identify and quantify 46 sample specific compounds, including several heterocyclic PAHs like 2-methylthiobenzothiazole, benzonapthothiophenes, benzonaphthofuranes and aromatic amines like diphenylamine and N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, which to our knowledge were not determined before. The PAHs concentrations determined in CR tiles purchased in Dutch and Spanish shops exceed the EU limits for articles marketed for use by the public. Furthermore, sets of methylated PAHs, dibenzothiazoles and aromatic amines were identified and quantified, and several other compounds were tentatively identified. The obtained results stress the need for expanding the list of target compounds analyzed in CR and the need for longitudinal studies on weathering processes taking place in CR."

G-quadruplex (G4)/hemin DNAzymes are of particular interest owing to their structural programmability and chemical robustness. However, optimized catalytic efficiency is still bottleneck and the activation mechanism is unclear. Herein, we have designed a series of parallel G4s with different proximal cytosine (dC) derivatives to fine-tune the hemin-binding pocket for G4-DNAzymes. Combining theoretical and experimental methods, we have assessed the dependence of catalytic enhancement on the electronic properties of proximal dCs and demonstrated how proximal dCs activate catalytic proficiency. These results provide interesting clues in recapitulating the push\u2013pull mechanism as the basis of peroxidase activity and help to devise a new strategy to design highly competent DNA catalysts whose performances are of the same order as protease."

  "description": "Bistability in fatty-acid oxidation resulting from substrate inhibitionIn this study we demonstrated through analytic considerations and numerical studies that the mitochondrial fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation can exhibit bistable-hysteresis behavior. In an experimentally validated computational model we identified a specific region in the parameter space in which two distinct stable and one unstable steady state could be attained with different fluxes. The two stable states were referred to as low-flux (disease) and high-flux (healthy) state. By a modular kinetic approach we traced the origin and causes of the bistability back to the distributive kinetics and the conservation of CoA, in particular in the last rounds of the \u03b2-oxidation. We then extended the model to investigate various interventions that may confer health benefits by activating the pathway, including (i) activation of the last enzyme MCKAT via its endogenous regulator p46-SHC protein, (ii) addition of a thioesterase (an acyl-CoA hydrolysing enzyme) as a safety valve, and (iii) concomitant activation of a number of upstream and downstream enzymes by short-chain fatty-acids (SCFA), metabolites that are produced from nutritional fibers in the gut. A high concentration of SCFAs, thioesterase activity, and inhibition of the p46Shc protein led to a disappearance of the bistability, leaving only the high-flux state. A better understanding of the switch behavior of the mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation process between a low- and a high-flux state may lead to dietary and pharmacological intervention in the treatment or prevention of obesity and or non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease."

  "description": "Characterisation of (anti-)progestogenic and (anti-)androgenic activities in surface and wastewater using high resolution effectdirected analysisThe quality of surface waters is threatened by pollution with low concentrations of bioactive chemicals, among which those interfering with steroid hormone systems. Induced by reports of anti-progestogenic activity in surface waters, a two-year four-weekly survey of (anti-)progestogenic activity was performed at three surface water locations in the Netherlands that serve as abstraction points for the production of drinking water. As certain endogenous and synthetic progestogenic compounds are also potent (anti-)androgens, these activities were also investigated. Anti-progestogenic and anti-androgenic activities were detected in the majority of the monitoring samples, sometimes in concentrations exceeding effect-based trigger values, indicating the need for further research. To characterize the compounds responsible for the activities, a high resolution Effect-Directed Analysis (hr-EDA) panel was combined with PR and AR CALUX bioassays, performed in agonistic and antagonistic modes. The influent and effluent of a domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were included as effluent is a possible emission source of active compounds. As drivers for androgenic and progestogenic activities several native and synthetic steroid hormones were identified in the WWTP samples, namely androstenedione, testosterone, DHT, levonorgestrel and cyproterone acetate. The pesticides metolachlor and cyazofamid were identified as contributors to both the anti-progestogenic and anti-androgenic activities in surface water. In addition, epiconazole contributed to the anti-progestogenic activities in the rivers Rhine and Enclosed Meuse. This study showed the strength of hr-EDA for the identification of bioactive compounds in environmental samples and shed light on the drivers of (anti-)progestogenic and (anti-)androgenic activities in the aquatic environment."

Also, we compared DNA extraction kits from Qiagen and Zymo-Research. The types of samples were defined strains, both as single species and mixtures, as well as undefined indigenous microbial communities from soil. We show that the use of a preservation solution resulted in substantial changes in the 16S rRNA gene profiles either due to an overrepresentation of Gram-positive bacteria or to an underrepresentation of Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, 16S rRNA gene profiles were substantially different depending on the type of kit that was used for extraction. The kit from Zymo extracted DNA from different types of bacteria in roughly equal amounts. In contrast, the kit from Qiagen preferentially extracted DNA from Gram-negative bacteria while DNA from Gram-positive bacteria was extracted less effectively. These differences in kit performance strongly influenced the interpretation of our microbial ecology studies."

  "description": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in Swedish household dust and exposure of pet catsPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are used in a wide range of products and have been found ubiquitously in our indoor environment, and there is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse endocrine effects, such as thyroid hormone disruption. Pet cats have a high dust intake due to their grooming behavior and have been shown to be a suitable sentinel species for assessment of toddler\u2019s exposure. Here we used paired household dust (n=46) and cat serum (n=27) samples to establish whether dust is a relevant exposure pathway to PFASs. An analytical method for PFAS analysis was optimized using a low volume of cat serum samples, combining solid-phase extraction and online sample cleanup. Dust was extracted with methanol by sonication and cleaned up by addition of active carbon. In total, 27 PFASs were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. The correlation between PFAS levels in dust and serum, serum lipids and thyroid hormone levels, and PFAS levels in dust between different rooms were statistically evaluated. PFOS and PFDA could be quantified in all cat serum samples (median 2300 pg/mL and 430 pg/mL, respectively), followed by PFOA (median 1100 pg/mL), quantified in 96% of the samples. The levels of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAPs were determined in 65% and 92% of the serum samples, respectively, and were an order of magnitude lower (1.4\u2013160 pg/mL). Household dust on the other hand was dominated by 6:2 and 8:2 diPAPs, with a median of 65 ng/g dust and 49 ng/g dust, respectively. PFOS (median 13 ng/g dust) and PFOA (median 9 ng/g dust) were quantified in 93% of the dust samples. Only eight PFASs were detected (>LOD) in at least 50% of the samples of both matrices and could be paired. Significant correlations between cat serum and dust were found for PFOA (rS=0.32, p<0.049) and PFUnDA (rS=0.55, p<0.001). Significant positive correlations were found between serum total thyroxine (rS=0.11, p<0.05) and PFNA and between serum cholesterol and PFHpA (rS=0.46, p<0.01), PFUnDA (rS=0.40, p<0.05), PFDoDA (rS=0.44, p<0.01), and sum PFAS (rS=0.48, p<0.01). In conclusion, this study confirmed that dust is a relevant exposure pathway for the ingestion of some PFASs for cats, and the serum levels of PFASs could be of relevance for the cat\u2019s health."

The computed activation energy systematically decreases as the basic sites of the diene progressively become protonated. Our activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses traced the origin of this enhanced reactivity to i) \u201cPauli-lowering catalysis\u201d for mono-protonated 2-aza-dienes due to the induction of an asynchronous, but still concerted, reaction pathway that reduces the Pauli repulsion between the reactants; and ii) \u201cLUMO-lowering catalysis\u201d for multi-protonated 2-aza-dienes due to their highly stabilized LUMO(s) and more concerted synchronous reaction path that facilitates more efficient orbital overlaps in IED interactions. In all, we illustrate how the novel concept of \u201cPauli-lowering catalysis\u201d can be overruled by the traditional concept of \u201cLUMO-lowering catalysis\u201d when the degree of LUMO stabilization is extreme as in the case of multi-protonated 2-aza-dienes."

  "description": "Using functional annotations to study pairwise interactions in urinary tract infection communitiesThe behaviour of microbial communities depends on environmental factors and on the interactions of the community members. This is also the case for urinary tract infection (UTI) microbial communities. Here, we devise a computational approach that uses indices of complementarity and competition based on metabolic gene annotation to rapidly predict putative interactions between pair of organisms with the aim to explain pairwise growth effects. We apply our method to 66 genomes selected from online databases, which belong to 6 genera representing members of UTI communities. This resulted in a selection of metabolic pathways with high correlation for each pairwise combination between a complementarity index and the experimentally derived growth data. Our results indicated that Enteroccus spp. were most complemented in its metabolism by the other members of the UTI community. This suggests that the growth of Enteroccus spp. can potentially be enhanced by complementary metabolites produced by other community members. We tested a few putative predicted interactions by experimental supplementation of the relevant predicted metabolites. As predicted by our method, folic acid supplementation led to the increase in the population density of UTI Enterococcus isolates. Overall, we believe our method is a rapid initial in silico screening for the prediction of metabolic interactions in microbial communities."

  "description": "GW100: A Slater-Type Orbital PerspectiveWe calculate complete basis set (CBS) limit-extrapolated ionization potentials (IPs) and electron affinities (EA) with Slater-type basis sets for the molecules in the GW100 database. To this end, we present two new Slater-type orbital (STO) basis sets of triple-(TZ) and quadruple-\u03b6 (QZ) quality, whose polarization is adequate for correlated-electron methods and which contain extra diffuse functions to be able to correctly calculate EAs of molecules with a positive lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). We demonstrate that going from TZ to QZ quality consistently reduces the basis set error of our computed IPs and EAs, and we conclude that a good estimate of these quantities at the CBS limit can be obtained by extrapolation. With mean absolute deviations (MAD) from 70 to 85 meV, our CBS limit-extrapolated IP are in good agreement with results from FHI-AIMS, TURBOMOLE, VASP, and WEST, while they differ by more than 130 meV on average from nanoGW. With a MAD of 160 meV, our EA are also in good agreement with the WEST code. Especially for systems with positive LUMOs, the agreement is excellent. With respect to other codes, the STO-type basis sets generally underestimate EAs of small molecules with strongly bound LUMOs. With 62 meV for IPs and 93 meV for EAs, we find much better agreement with CBS limit-extrapolated results from FHI-AIMS for a set of 250 medium to large organic molecules."

This first study shows that cured do-it-yourself spray one-component SPFs (OCFs) often contain chlorinated paraffins (C14-C37), and tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP), ranging 0.2\u201350%, and 0.9\u201330% w/w, respectively. Six OCFs contained CP levels ranging 22\u201350% w/w, whereas nine OCFs used for similar applications only contained CP levels ranging 2\u201317% w/w. It is unclear if the combination CPs/TCIPP is meant to improve the flame retardancy of products, and could suggest an unnecessary use of high CPs/TCIPP concentrations in OCFs. The two-component SPFs (TCFs) contained only TCIPP with levels ranging from 7.0% to 9.0%. The CPs and TCIPP were easily transferred from cured OCFs to the hands. Levels up to 590 \u00b5g per hand for CPs and up to 2.7 \u00b5g per hand for TCIPP were found. After end-of-life, it is challenging to recycle used SPFs. They may, therefore, end up at landfills where the TCIPP/CPs may leach into the environment. Therefore, further investigation is needed to assess potential exposure risks associated with general and occupational use, and the impact of landfill leaching on the environment."

  "description": "Bidirectional string anchors: A new string sampling mechanismThe minimizers sampling mechanism is a popular mechanism for string sampling introduced independently by Schleimer et al. [SIGMOD 2003] and by Roberts et al. [Bioinf. 2004]. Given two positive integers w and k, it selects the lexicographically smallest length-k substring in every fragment of w consecutive length-k substrings (in every sliding window of length w + k \u2212 1). Minimizers samples are approximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. Although they do not have good worst-case guarantees on their size, they are often small in practice. They thus have been successfully employed in several string processing applications. Two main disadvantages of minimizers sampling mechanisms are: first, they also do not have good guarantees on the expected size of their samples for every combination of w and k; and, second, indexes that are constructed over their samples do not have good worst-case guarantees for on-line pattern searches. To alleviate these disadvantages, we introduce bidirectional string anchors (bd-anchors), a new string sampling mechanism. Given a positive integer \u2113, our mechanism selects the lexicographically smallest rotation in every length-\u2113 fragment (in every sliding window of length \u2113). We show that bd-anchors samples are also approximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. In addition, our experiments using several datasets demonstrate that the bd-anchors sample sizes decrease proportionally to \u2113; and that these sizes are competitive to or smaller than the minimizers sample sizes using the analogous sampling parameters. We provide theoretical justification for these results by analyzing the expected size of bd-anchors samples. We also show that by using any bd-anchors sample, we can construct, in near-linear time, an index which requires linear (extra) space in the size of the sample and answers on-line pattern searches in near-optimal time. We further show, using several datasets, that a simple implementation of our index is consistently faster for on-line pattern searches than an analogous implementation of a minimizers-based index [Grabowski and Raniszewski, Softw. Pract. Exp. 2017]. Finally, we highlight the applicability of bd-anchors by developing an efficient and effective heuristic for top-K similarity search under edit distance. We show, using synthetic datasets, that our heuristic is more accurate and more than one order of magnitude faster in top-K similarity searches than the state-of-the-art tool for the same purpose [Zhang and Zhang, KDD 2020]."

  "description": "Faster algorithms for longest common substringIn the classic longest common substring (LCS) problem, we are given two strings S and T, each of length at most n, over an alphabet of size \u03c3, and we are asked to find a longest string occurring as a fragment of both S and T. Weiner, in his seminal paper that introduced the suffix tree, presented an O(nlog \u03c3)-time algorithm for this problem [SWAT 1973]. For polynomially-bounded integer alphabets, the linear-time construction of suffix trees by Farach yielded an O(n)-time algorithm for the LCS problem [FOCS 1997]. However, for small alphabets, this is not necessarily optimal for the LCS problem in the word RAM model of computation, in which the strings can be stored in O(nlog \u03c3/log n) space and read in O(nlog \u03c3/log n) time. We show that, in this model, we can compute an LCS in time O(nlog \u03c3/\u221alog n), which is sublinear in n if \u03c3 = 2o(\u221alog n) (in particular, if \u03c3 = O(1)), using optimal space O(nlog \u03c3/log n). We then lift our ideas to the problem of computing a k-mismatch LCS, which has received considerable attention in recent years. In this problem, the aim is to compute a longest substring of S that occurs in T with at most k mismatches. Flouri et al. showed how to compute a 1-mismatch LCS in O(nlog n) time [IPL 2015]. Thankachan et al. extended this result to computing a k-mismatch LCS in O(nlogk n) time for k = O(1) [J. Comput. Biol. 2016]. We show an O(nlogk\u22121/2 n)-time algorithm, for any constant integer k > 0 and irrespective of the alphabet size, using O(n) space as the previous approaches. We thus notably break through the well-known nlogk n barrier, which stems from a recursive heavy-path decomposition technique that was first introduced in the seminal paper of Cole et al. [STOC 2004] for string indexing with k errors."

  "description": "On the Minimum Error Correction Problem for Haplotype Assembly in Diploid and Polyploid GenomesIn diploid genomes, haplotype assembly is the computational problem of reconstructing the two parental copies, called haplotypes, of each chromosome starting from sequencing reads, called fragments, possibly affected by sequencing errors. Minimum error correction (MEC) is a prominent computational problem for haplotype assembly and, given a set of fragments, aims at reconstructing the two haplotypes by applying the minimum number of base corrections. MEC is computationally hard to solve, but some approximation-based or fixed-parameter approaches have been proved capable of obtaining accurate results on real data. In this work, we expand the current characterization of the computational complexity of MEC from the approximation and the fixed-parameter tractability point of view. In particular, we show that MEC is not approximable within a constant factor, whereas it is approximable within a logarithmic factor in the size of the input. Furthermore, we answer open questions on the fixed-parameter tractability for parameters of classical or practical interest: the total number of corrections and the fragment length. In addition, we present a direct 2-approximation algorithm for a variant of the problem that has also been applied in the framework of clustering data. Finally, since polyploid genomes, such as those of plants and fishes, are composed of more than two copies of the chromosomes, we introduce a novel formulation of MEC, namely the k-ploid MEC problem, that extends the traditional problem to deal with polyploid genomes. We show that the novel formulation is still both computationally hard and hard to approximate. Nonetheless, from the parameterized point of view, we prove that the problem is tractable for parameters of practical interest such as the number of haplotypes and the coverage, or the number of haplotypes and the fragment length."

  "description": "Novel Production Protocol for Small-scale Manufacture of Probiotic Fermented Foods\u00a9 2016 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.A novel dried bacterial consortium of Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 and Streptococcus thermophilus C106 is cultured in 1 L of milk. This fresh starter can be used for the production of fermented milk and other fermented foods either at home or at small-scale in rural settings. For the fresh starter, 1 L of milk is pasteurized in a pan that fits into a larger pan containing water, placed on a source of heat. In this water bath, the milk is heated and incubated at 85 \u00b0C for 30 min. Thereafter, the milk is cooled down to 45 \u00b0C, transferred to a vacuum flask, inoculated with the dried bacteria and left for at least 16 hr between 30 \u00b0C and 45 \u00b0C. For the purpose of frequent home production, the fresh starter is frozen into ice cubes, which can be used for the production of small volumes of up to 2 L of fermented milk. For the purpose of small-scale production in resource-poor countries, pasteurization of up to 100 L of milk is conducted in milk cans that are placed in a large sauce pan filled with water and heated on a fire at 85 \u00b0C for 30 min, and subsequently cooled to 45 \u00b0C. Next, the 100 L batch is inoculated with the 1 L freshly prepared starter mentioned before. To assure an effective fermentation at a temperature between 30 and 45 \u00b0C, the milk can is covered with a blanket for 12 hr. For the production of non-dairy fermented foods, the fresh starter is left in a cheese cloth for 12 hr, and the drained-off whey can be subsequently used for the inoculation of a wide range of food raw materials, including vegetables and cereal-based foods."

  "description": "A metabolic core model elucidates how enhanced utilization of glucose and glutamine, with enhanced glutamine-dependent lactate production, promotes cancer cell growth: The WarburQ effectCancer cells share several metabolic traits, including aerobic production of lactate from glucose (Warburg effect), extensive glutamine utilization and impaired mitochondrial electron flow. It is still unclear how these metabolic rearrangements, which may involve different molecular events in different cells, contribute to a selective advantage for cancer cell proliferation. To ascertain which metabolic pathways are used to convert glucose and glutamine to balanced energy and biomass production, we performed systematic constraint-based simulations of a model of human central metabolism. Sampling of the feasible flux space allowed us to obtain a large number of randomly mutated cells simulated at different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We observed that, in the limited subset of proliferating cells, most displayed fermentation of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high utilization rates of glutamine, oxidative utilization of glucose was decreased, while the production of lactate from glutamine was enhanced. This emergent phenotype was observed only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized by the available oxygen. Under the latter conditions, standard Flux Balance Analysis indicated that: this metabolic pattern is optimal to maximize biomass and ATP production; it requires the activity of a branched TCA cycle, in which glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates to the production of lipids and proteins; it is sustained by a variety of redox-controlled metabolic reactions. In a K-ras transformed cell line we experimentally assessed glutamine-induced metabolic changes. We validated computational results through an extension of Flux Balance Analysis that allows prediction of metabolite variations. Taken together these findings offer new understanding of the logic of the metabolic reprogramming that underlies cancer cell growth."

  "description": "Cell surface properties of Lactococcus lactis reveal milk protein binding specifically evolved in dairy isolatesSurface properties of bacteria are determined by the molecular composition of the cell wall and they are important for interactions of cells with their environment. Well known examples of bacterial interactions with surfaces are biofilm formation and the fermentation of solid materials like food and feed. Lactococcus lactis is broadly used for the fermentation of cheese and buttermilk and it is primarily isolated from either plant material or the dairy environment. In this study, we characterized surface hydrophobicity, charge, emulsification properties and the attachment to milk proteins of 55 L. lactis strains in stationary and exponential growth phases. The attachment to milk protein was assessed through a newly developed flow cytometry-based protocol. Besides finding a high degree of biodiversity, phenotype-genotype matching allowed the identification of candidate genes involved in the modification of the cell surface. Overexpression and gene deletion analysis allowed to verify the predictions for three identified proteins that altered surface hydrophobicity and attachment of milk proteins. The data also showed that lactococci isolated from a dairy environment bind higher amounts of milk proteins when compared to plant isolates. It remains to be determined whether the alteration of surface properties also has potential to alter starter culture functionalities."

  "description": "Expectations of the Kohn-Sham operator in a natural-orbital functional environment: An adiabatic response theory with single and double excitationsA combined adiabatic approach is proposed in which orbital expectations of the Kohn-Sham operator (KSEs) are embedded into the matrix environment of time-dependent phase-including natural-orbital functional theory (TDPINOFT). Analytical diagonalization of a model molecular matrix eigenvalue problem shows that the resultant TDNOFT-KSE combines strong sides of both adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and TDPINOFT. Around the equilibrium, like in TDDFT, the energy of a single excitation of the model is evaluated with the KSEs. In its turn, the TDPINOFT environment provides an effective Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) kernel, which properly diverges in the bond dissociation limit. This environment also generates a double excitation, the energy of which is related to the ratio of fractional occupation numbers of the natural orbitals."

  "description": "Engineered factor Xa variants retain procoagulant activity independent of direct factor Xa inhibitorsThe absence of an adequate reversal strategy to prevent and stop potential life-threatening bleeding complications is a major drawback to the clinical use of the direct oral inhibitors of blood coagulation factor Xa. Here we show that specific modifications of the substrate-binding aromatic S4 subpocket within the factor Xa active site disrupt high-affinity engagement of the direct factor Xa inhibitors. These modifications either entail amino-acid substitution of S4 subsite residues Tyr99 and/or Phe174 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), or extension of the 99-loop that borders the S4 subsite. The latter modifications led to the engineering of a factor Xa variant that is able to support coagulation in human plasma spiked with (supra-)physiological concentrations of direct factor Xa inhibitors. As such, this factor Xa variant has the potential to be employed to bypass the direct factor Xa inhibitor-mediated anticoagulation in patients that require restoration of blood coagulation.A major drawback in the clinical use of the oral anticoagulants that directly inhibit factor Xa in order to prevent blood clot formation is the potential for life threatening bleeding events. Here the authors describe factor Xa variants that are refractory to inhibition by these anticoagulants and could serve as rescue agents in treated patients."

Earth oxides are a group of materials with catalytic effects in nanocrystalline forms, and strong magnetic field effects with promising applications in nanomagnetics as well as potential key parts in memory processing units. Their electronic properties in nanocrystalline forms are however not fully understood, and as nanocrystal species behave differently from bulk material, the electronic properties of a set of MgO clusters in small, large, regular and irregular geometries and forms are here studied using the B3LYP and M06-2X levels of quantum theory. The analysis show that particularly the thin sheet MgO clusters exert high diamagnetic properties. Furthermore, vacancies of MgO induce interesting effects at the orbital gap-level and on the electronic populations of the clusters. A NBO analysis shows furthermore that the electronic population in irregular clusters missing MgO units, is quite different from regular structures which highlights that material deficiencies may induce different chemical reactivities and physical effects. The results supplied here show that computational quantum mechanical approaches are of significant value for studying and engineering nanoparticles and nanoclusters, with particular relevance to the emerging methods of nanoscaling by nanophotonic processes, for synthesis and industrial application of nanoparticle MgO in nanoelectronics."

  "description": "The single cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterase of the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia represents a potential drug targetBackground: Giardiasis is an intestinal infection correlated with poverty and poor drinking water quality, and treatment options are limited. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Giardia infections afflict nearly 33% of people in developing countries, and 2% of the adult population in the developed world. This study describes the single cyclic nucleotide-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) of G. lamblia and assesses PDE inhibitors as a new generation of anti-giardial drugs. Methods: An extensive search of the Giardia genome database identified a single gene coding for a class I PDE, GlPDE. The predicted protein sequence was analyzed in-silico to characterize its domain structure and catalytic domain. Enzymatic activity of GlPDE was established by complementation of a PDE-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain, and enzyme kinetics were characterized in soluble yeast lysates. The potency of known PDE inhibitors was tested against the activity of recombinant GlPDE expressed in yeast and against proliferating Giardia trophozoites. Finally, the localization of epitope-tagged and ectopically expressed GlPDE in Giardia cells was investigated. Results: Giardia encodes a class I PDE. Catalytically important residues are fully conserved between GlPDE and human PDEs, but sequence differences between their catalytic domains suggest that designing Giardia-specific inhibitors is feasible. Recombinant GlPDE hydrolyzes cAMP with a Kmof 408 \u03bcM, and cGMP is not accepted as a substrate. A number of drugs exhibit a high degree of correlation between their potency against the recombinant enzyme and their inhibition of trophozoite proliferation in culture. Epitope-tagged GlPDE localizes as dots in a pattern reminiscent of mitosomes and to the perinuclear region in Giardia. Conclusions: Our data strongly suggest that inhibition of G. lamblia PDE activity leads to a profound inhibition of parasite proliferation and that GlPDE is a promising target for developing novel anti-giardial drugs."

We demonstrated the expected co-fractionation of canonical synaptic proteins belonging to the same functional groups. The enrichment profiles also suggested the presence of many novel pre- and post-synaptic proteins. Using super-resolution microscopy on primary neuronal culture we confirmed the postsynaptic localization of PLEKHA5 and ADGRA1.

  "description": "Environmental effects on growth, reproduction, and life-history traits of loggerhead turtlesUnderstanding the relationship between the environmental conditions and life-history traits (such as growth, reproduction, and size at specific life stages) is important for understanding the population dynamics of a species and for constructing adaptable, relevant, and efficient conservation measures. For the endangered loggerhead turtle, characterizing effects of environmental conditions on the life-history traits is complicated by this species\u2019 longevity, global distribution, and migratory way of life. Two significant environmental factors \u2013 temperature and available food \u2013 often account for most of observed intra-population variability in growth and reproduction rates, suggesting that those two factors determine the biological responses of an individual. Adopting this hypothesis, we simulate a range of the two environmental factors to quantify effects of changes in temperature and food availability on an individual's physiology (energy investment into processes such as growth, maturation, and reproduction) and the resulting life-history traits. To represent an individual, we use a previously developed mechanistic dynamic energy budget (DEB) model for loggerhead turtles. DEB models rely on one of the empirically best validated general ecological theories, which captures rules of energy acquisition and utilization. We found that the ultimate size (length and mass) is primarily affected by food availability, whereas growth and maturation are primarily affected by temperature whilst also showing positive correlation with available food. Reproduction increases with both food availability and temperature because food availability determines energy investment into egg production, and temperature affects the rate of related processes (such as vitellogenesis). Length at puberty varies between simulated scenarios by only a small proportion, suggesting that inter-individual variability plays a larger role for length at puberty than the environmental factors do."

The development of potent, selective and safer inhibitors is ongoing with in silico screening methods playing a more prominent role in the search for promising lead compounds in bioactivity-relevant chemical space. Here we present a set of comprehensive binding affinity prediction models for CYP19A1 using our automated Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) based workflow on a set of 132 putative and structurally diverse aromatase inhibitors obtained from a typical industrial screening study. We extended the workflow with machine learning methods to automatically cluster training and test compounds in order to maximize the number of explained compounds in one or more predictive LIE models. The method uses protein-ligand interaction profiles obtained from Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectories to help model search and define the applicability domain of the resolved models. Our method was successful in accounting for 86% of the data set in 3 robust models that show high correlation between calculated and observed values for ligand-binding free energies (RMSE < 2.5 kJ mol(-1)), with good cross-validation statistics."

Snake venoms are also known to contain anti-fibrinolytic agents with therapeutic potential, which makes them a good source of new plasmin inhibitors. The protease plasmin degrades fibrin clots, and changes in its activity can lead to life-threatening levels of fibrinolysis. Here, we present a methodology for the screening of plasmin inhibitors in snake venoms and the simultaneous assessment of general venom protease activity. Venom is first chromatographically separated followed by column effluent collection onto a 384-well plate using nanofractionation. Via a post-column split, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of the effluent is performed in parallel. The nanofractionated venoms are exposed to a plasmin bioassay, and the resulting bioassay activity chromatograms are correlated to the MS data. To study observed proteolytic activity of venoms in more detail, venom fractions were exposed to variants of the plasmin bioassay in which the assay mixture was enriched with zinc or calcium ions, or the chelating agents EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline were added. The plasmin activity screening system was applied to snake venoms and successfully detected compounds exhibiting antiplasmin (anti-fibrinolytic) activities in the venom of Daboia russelii, and metal-dependent proteases in the venom of Crotalus basiliscus.

  "description": "Mycobacteria employ two different mechanisms to cross the blood-brain barrierCentral nervous system (CNS) infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most devastating complications of tuberculosis, in particular in early childhood. In order to induce CNS infection, M. tuberculosis needs to cross specialised barriers protecting the brain. How M. tuberculosis crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enters the CNS is not well understood. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae and the closely related pathogen Mycobacterium marinum to answer this question. We show that in the early stages of development, mycobacteria rapidly infect brain tissue, either as free mycobacteria or within circulating macrophages. After the formation of a functionally intact BBB, the infiltration of brain tissue by infected macrophages is delayed, but not blocked, suggesting that crossing the BBB via phagocytic cells is one of the mechanisms used by mycobacteria to invade the CNS. Interestingly, depletion of phagocytic cells did not prevent M. marinum from infecting the brain tissue, indicating that free mycobacteria can independently cause brain infection. Detailed analysis showed that mycobacteria are able to cause vasculitis by extracellular outgrowth in the smaller blood vessels and by infecting endothelial cells. Importantly, we could show that this second mechanism is an active process that depends on an intact ESX-1 secretion system, which extends the role of ESX-1 secretion beyond the macrophage infection cycle."

  "description": "Bacterial secretion chaperones: The mycobacterial type VII caseChaperones are central players in maintaining the proteostasis in all living cells. Besides highly conserved generic chaperones that assist protein folding and assembly in the cytosol, additional more specific chaperones have evolved to ensure the successful trafficking of proteins with extra-cytoplasmic locations. Associated with the distinctive secretion systems present in bacteria, different dedicated chaperones have been described that not only keep secretory proteins in a translocation competent state, but often are also involved in substrate targeting to the specific translocation channel. Recently, a new class of such chaperones has been identified that are involved in the specific recognition of substrates transported via the type VII secretion pathway in mycobacteria. In this minireview, we provide an overview of the different bacterial chaperones with a focus on their roles in protein secretion and will discuss in detail the roles of mycobacterial type VII secretion chaperones in substrate recognition and targeting."

  "description": "LC\u2013MS/MS assay for assessing medical adherence in patients under warfarin maintenance therapyWarfarin (WRN) use is plagued by response fluctuation which is managed by dose adjustment. The plasma WRN level had always been an abandoned prerequisite for dose adjustment. However, recent reports had correlated WRN level to the consumed dose. More importantly, the intra-individual alteration in WRN level was found proportional to response fluctuation. This renewed the interest to use WRN level prior to dose adjustment to account for dispensing errors or inadequate adherence. Detection of possibly interacting drugs may further assess compliance and enable a wiser dose adjustment. In this study, an LC\u2013MS/MS assay was developed and validated for the determination of the WRN and the simultaneous detection of interacting drugs in citrated plasma samples normally collected for monitoring international normalized ration (INR). Samples were prepared by liquid-liquid extraction. Separation of WRN and interacting drugs (n = 19) was achieved on an Inertsil\u00aeC18 column using a gradient elution program. The assay was applied in 96 plasma samples from patients. The developed method was linear, accurate and precise for WRN determination with average recovery of 99.5 \u00b1 8.4% and no relative matrix effect. WRN plasma level was measured in all samples and possible interacting drugs were detected. An improved WRN-response correlation was observed inter-individually when patient variability was reduced. Our results support the significance of WRN monitoring and suggest the additional monitoring of other interacting drugs for integrated evaluation of patient adherence. The developed method enables ruling-out inadequate adherence prior to unnecessary dose adjustment and highlights the need to strengthen patient education procedures."

  "description": "On display: Autotransporter secretion and applicationThe classical monomeric autotransporters are ubiquitously used by Gram-negative bacteria to export virulence and colonization factors to their cell surface or into their surroundings. They are expressed as monomeric proteins that pass the inner and outer membrane in two consecutive steps facilitated by the Sec translocon and the Bam complex, respectively. In this mini-review we discuss how autotransporters translocate their secreted functional domains across the outer membrane. We highlight the interactions with the Bam complex and discuss how specific features of the recently solved structure of Bam lead to a mechanistic model for autotransporter secretion. Furthermore, the autotransporter secretion pathway is the system of choice for surface display of heterologous proteins for biotechnical and biomedical purposes. We summarize recent advances in the application of autotransporters with a focus on outer membrane vesicle vaccine development and discuss its limitations in secreting more complex heterologous proteins. Finally, we present an exciting new technology to circumvent secretion limitations by ligating heterologous proteins of interest to autotransporters that are displayed on the cell surface."

Our design was based on a previously identified efficacy hotspot for the peptidergic chemokine receptor CXCR3 and resulted in the synthesis and characterization of five new azobenzene-containing CXCR3 ligands. G protein activation assays and real-time electrophysiology experiments demonstrated photoswitching from antagonism to partial agonism and even to full agonism (compound VUF16216). SAR evaluation suggests that the size and electron-donating properties of the substituents on the inner aromatic ring are important for the efficacy photoswitching. These compounds are the first GPCR azo ligands with a nearly full efficacy photoswitch and may become valuable pharmacological tools for the optical control of peptidergic GPCR signaling."

  "description": "Structural analysis of the interaction between the bacterial cell division proteins FTSQ and FTSBMost bacteria and archaea use the tubulin homologue FtsZ as its central organizer of cell division. In Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria, FtsZ recruits cytosolic, transmembrane, periplasmic, and outer membrane proteins, assembling the divisome that facilitates bacterial cell division. One such divisome component, FtsQ, a bitopic membrane protein with a globular domain in the periplasm, has been shown to interact with many other divisome proteins. Despite its otherwise unknown function, it has been shown to be a major divisome interaction hub. Here, we investigated the interactions of FtsQ with FtsB and FtsL, two small bitopic membrane proteins that act immediately downstream of FtsQ. We show in biochemical assays that the periplasmic domains of E. coli FtsB and FtsL interact with FtsQ, but not with each other. Our crystal structure of FtsB bound to the \u03b2 domain of FtsQ shows that only residues 64 to 87 of FtsB interact with FtsQ. A synthetic peptide comprising those 24 FtsB residues recapitulates the FtsQ-FtsB interactions. Protein deletions and structure-guided mutant analyses validate the structure. Furthermore, the same structure-guided mutants show cell division defects in vivo that are consistent with our structure of the FtsQ-FtsB complex that shows their interactions as they occur during cell division. Our work provides intricate details of the interactions within the divisome and also provides a tantalizing view of a highly conserved protein interaction in the periplasm of bacteria that is an excellent target for cell division inhibitor searches. IMPORTANCE In most bacteria and archaea, filaments of FtsZ protein organize cell division. FtsZ forms a ring structure at the division site and starts the recruitment of 10 to 20 downstream proteins that together form a multiprotein complex termed the divisome. The divisome is thought to facilitate many of the steps required to make two cells out of one. FtsQ and FtsB are part of the divisome, with FtsQ being a central hub, interacting with most of the other divisome components. Here we show for the first time in detail how FtsQ interacts with its downstream partner FtsB and show that mutations that disturb the interface between the two proteins effectively inhibit cell division."

  "description": "Rapid ligand fishing for identification of acetylcholinesterase-binding peptides in snake venom reveals new properties of dendrotoxinsAcetylcholinesterase (AChE) from Electrophorus electricus (eel) was immobilized on the surface of amino-modified paramagnetic beads to serve as a model for the development, validation and application of a new affinity-based ligand-fishing assay for the discovery of bioactive peptides from complex protein mixtures such as venoms. Nano liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS) was used for the analysis of trapped peptides. Using enzyme-functionalized beads, the ligand-fishing assay was evaluated and optimized using a peptide reference mixture composed of one acetylcholinesterase binder (fasciculin-II) and five non-binders (mambalgin-1, angiotensin-II, bradykinin, cardiotoxin and \u03b1-bungarotoxin). As proof of concept, snake venom samples spiked with fasciculin-II demonstrated assay selectivity and sensitivity, fishing the peptide binder from complex venom solutions at concentrations as low as 1.0 \u03bcg/mL. As negative controls for method validation, venoms of four different snake species, not known to harbor AChE binding peptides, were screened and no AChE binders were detected. The applicability of the ligand fishing assay was subsequently demonstrated with venom from the black mamba, Jameson's mamba and western green mamba (Dendroaspis spp.), which have previously been reported to contain the AChE binding fasciculins. Unknown peptides (i.e. not fasciculins) with affinity to AChE were recovered from all mamba venoms tested. Tryptic digestion followed by nano-LC-MS analysis of the material recovered from black mamba venom identified the peptide with highest AChE-binding affinity as dendrotoxin-I, a pre-synaptic neurotoxin previously not known to interact with AChE. Co-incubation of AChE with various dendrotoxins in vitro revealed reduced inactivation of AChE activity over time, thus demonstrating that these toxins stabilize AChE."

  "description": "Differentiation of human iPSCs into functional podocytesPodocytes play a critical role in glomerular barrier function, both in health and disease. However, in vivo terminally differentiated podocytes are difficult to be maintained in in vitro culture. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer the unique possibility for directed differentiation into mature podocytes. The current differentiation protocol to generate iPSC-derived podocyte-like cells provides a robust and reproducible method to obtain podocyte-like cells after 10 days that can be employed in in vitro research and biomedical engineering. Previous published protocols were improved by testing varying differentiation media, growth factors, seeding densities, and time course conditions. Modifications were made to optimize and simplify the one-step differentiation procedure. In contrast to earlier protocols, adherent cells for differentiation were used, the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) was reduced to a minimum, and thus \u00df-mercaptoethanol could be omitted. The plating densities of iPSC stocks as well as the seeding densities for differentiation cultures turned out to be a crucial parameter for differentiation results. Conditionally immortalized human podocytes served as reference controls. iPSC-derived podocyte-like cells showed a typical podocyte-specific morphology and distinct expression of podocyte markers synaptopodin, podocin, nephrin and WT-1 after 10 days of differentiation as assessed by immunofluorescence staining or Western blot analysis. qPCR results showed a downregulation of pluripotency markers Oct4 and Sox-2 and a 9-fold upregulation of the podocyte marker synaptopodin during the time course of differentiation. Cultured podocytes exhibited endocytotic uptake of albumin. In toxicological assays, matured podocytes clearly responded to doxorubicin (Adriamycin\u2122) with morphological alterations and a reduction in cell viability after 48 h of incubation."

  "description": "Maintaining maximal metabolic flux by gene expression controlOne of the marvels of biology is the phenotypic plasticity of microorganisms. It allows them to maintain high growth rates across conditions. Studies suggest that cells can express metabolic enzymes at tuned concentrations through adjustment of gene expression. The associated transcription factors are often regulated by intracellular metabolites. Here we study metabolite-mediated regulation of metabolic-gene expression that maximises metabolic fluxes across conditions. We developed an adaptive control theory, qORAC (for \u2018Specific Flux (q) Optimization by Robust Adaptive Control\u2019), and illustrate it with several examples of metabolic pathways. The key feature of the theory is that it does not require knowledge of the regulatory network, only of the metabolic part. We derive that maximal metabolic flux can be maintained in the face of varying N environmental parameters only if the number of transcription-factor binding metabolites is at least equal to N. The controlling circuits appear to require simple biochemical kinetics. We conclude that microorganisms likely can achieve maximal rates in metabolic pathways, in the face of environmental changes."

  "description": "Naturally fermented milk from northern Senegal: Bacterial community composition and probiotic enrichment with Lactobacillus rhamnosusA variety of foods fermented with lactic acid bacteria serve as dietary staples in many African communities; yet, their bacterial profiles are poorly characterized. The integration of health-promoting probiotics into naturally fermented milk products could make a profound impact on human health. Here, we characterize the bacterial community composition of a naturally fermented milk product (lait caill\u00e9) from northern Senegal, prepared in wooden bowls (lahals) with a bacterial biofilm to steer the fermentation process. We incorporated a probiotic starter culture containing the most documented probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (generic strain name yoba 2012) into the local fermentation process. Bar-coded 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing of lait caill\u00e9 samples indicated that the bacterial community of lait caill\u00e9 has high species richness with over 100 bacterial genera; however, few have high abundance. In contrast to the diverse bacterial compositions of other characterized naturally fermented milk products, the composition of lait caill\u00e9 predominantly consists of the lactic acid bacteria Streptococcus and Lactobacillus, resembling the bacterial composition in regular yogurt. The bacterial community composition of lait caill\u00e9 varies geographically based on the presence of some genera, including Lactoccoccus, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Bacillus, but this trend is not consistent within production communities. The diversity of bacterial communities is much higher in the lahal biofilm than in the naturally fermented milk products, which is in turn greater than in commercial yogurts. Addition of a starter culture with L. Rhamnosus yoba 2012 to milk in lahals led to substantial growth of this probiotic bacterium during the fermentation process. Two independent quantitative PCR-analyses specific for L. Rhamnosus yoba 2012 indicated a 20-to 60-fold increase in the total number of probiotic bacteria in the first batch after inoculation. A similar increase of the probiotic was observed in a variation of lait caill\u00e9 prepared with carbohydrate-rich millet granules (thiakry) added prior to fermentation. This study shows the feasibility of integrating health-promoting probiotic strains into naturally fermented foods produced in regions with a high prevalence of malnutrition."

Lett. 118, 253001 (2017)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.118.253001] we have described how studies of the recoil velocity distribution in the photodissociation of OCS in the energy interval 42 600-42 900 cm-1 revealed an unexpected behavior: the recoil velocity distribution of only the lowest-kinetic-energy photofragments exhibited rapid, resonantlike variations with energy and caused complete inversion of the recoil direction. Periodic orbit analysis and quantum nonadiabatic calculations unveiled the existence of a resonance state localized at large bending angles towards the exit of the dissociation channel. In this article, we present an extensive theoretical study and we show how the fingerprints of these resonances are identified by the analysis of the nonadiabatic transitions and the stereodynamics of photofragments trajectories. Additionally, the experimental study is extended to a second photolysis energy region, 43 300-43 650 cm-1, where a similar rapid variation of the recoil direction is detected. The energy separation between this second resonance region and the one previously reported is \u223c800cm-1, which is twice the calculated period of the localized resonant state, offering a second point of convergence between the experiment and the theory."

  "description": "Characterization of complex polyether polyols using comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometryPolyether polyols are often used in formulated systems, but their complete characterization is challenging, because of simultaneous heterogeneities in chemical composition, molecular weight and functionality. One-dimensional liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry is commonly used to characterize polyether polyols. However, the separation power of this technique is not sufficient to resolve the complexity of such samples entirely. In this study, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography hyphenated with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC \u00d7 LC-HRMS) was used for the characterization of (i) castor oil ethoxylates (COEs) reacted with different mole equivalents of ethylene oxide and (ii) a blended formulation consisting of glycerol ethoxylate, glycerol propoxylate and glycerol ethoxylate-random-propoxylate copolymers. Retention in the first (hydrophilic-interaction-chromatography) dimension was mainly governed by degree of ethoxylation, while the second reversed-phase dimension resolved the samples based on degree of propoxylation (blended formulation) or alkyl chain length (COEs). For different COE samples, we observed the separation of isomer distributions of various di-, tri- and tetra-esters, and such positional isomers were studied by tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). This revealed characteristic fragmentation patterns, which allowed discrimination of the isomers based on terminal or internal positioning of the fatty-acid moieties and provided insight in the LC \u00d7 LC retention behavior of such species."

  "description": "A mode-of-action ontology model for safety evaluation of chemicals: Outcome of a series of workshops on repeated dose toxicityRepeated dose toxicity evaluation aims at assessing the occurrence of adverse effects following chronic or repeated exposure to chemicals. Non-animal approaches have gained importance in the last decades because of ethical considerations as well as due to scientific reasons calling for more human-based strategies. A critical aspect of this challenge is linked to the capacity to cover a comprehensive set of interdependent mechanisms of action, link them to adverse effects and interpret their probability to be triggered in the light of the exposure at the (sub)cellular level. Inherent to its structured nature, an ontology addressing repeated dose toxicity could be a scientific and transparent way to achieve this goal. Additionally, repeated dose toxicity evaluation through the use of a harmonized ontology should be performed in a reproducible and consistent manner, while mimicking as accurately as possible human physiology and adaptivity. In this paper, the outcome of a series of workshops organized by Cosmetics Europe on this topic is reported. As such, this manuscript shows how experts set critical elements and ways of establishing a mode-of-action ontology model as a support to risk assessors aiming to perform animal-free safety evaluation of chemicals based on repeated dose toxicity data."

An analytical-quality-by-design approach was embraced for method development, method implementation, and method maintenance. CZE provided separation of adenovirus particles from sample matrix components, such as cell debris, residual DNA and proteins. The intermediate precision of the virus particle concentration was 6.9% RSD and the relative bias was 2.3%. In comparison, the CZE method is intended to replace a quantitative polymerase chain reaction method which requires three replicates in three analytical runs to achieve an intermediate precision of 8.1% RSD. Given that, in addition, the time from sampling till reporting results of the CZE method was less than 2 h, whereas quantitative polymerase chain reaction requires 3 days, it follows that the CZE method enables faster processing times in downstream processing."

The U-3CR between electronically diverse isocyanides, carboxylic acids and 4-substituted \u03941-piperideines proceeds in a highly diastereoselective fashion. The \u03941-piperideines are obtained by NCS-mediated oxidation of the corresponding 4-substituted piperidines, which in turn are generated by an efficient two-step procedure involving the alkylation of 4-picoline and subsequent catalytic hydrogenation of the pyridine ring. We demonstrate the utility of this U-3CR, in combination with the convertible isocyanide 2-bromo-6-isocyanopyridine, in the synthesis of the anticoagulant argatroban."

In this study, we describe a novel presynaptic mechanism of cis-regulated oligomerization of adhesion molecules that controls synaptogenesis. We identified synaptic adhesion-like molecule 1 (SALM1) as a constituent of the proposed presynaptic Munc18/CASK/Mint1/Lin7b organizer complex. SALM1 preferentially localized to presynaptic compartments of excitatory hippocampal neurons. SALM1 depletion in excitatory hippocampal primary neurons impaired Neurexin1\u03b2- and Neuroligin1-mediated excitatory synaptogenesis and reduced synaptic vesicle clustering, synaptic transmission, and synaptic vesicle release. SALM1 promoted Neurexin1\u03b2 clustering in an F-actin- and PIP2-dependent manner. Two basic residues in SALM1's juxtamembrane polybasic domain are essential for this clustering. Together, these data show that SALM1 is a presynaptic organizer of synapse development by promoting F-actin/PIP2-dependent clustering of Neurexin."

  "description": "Induced RPB1 depletion reveals a direct gene-specific control of RNA Polymerase III function by RNA Polymerase IIIncreasing evidence suggests that tRNA levels are dynamically and specifically regulated in response to internal and external cues to modulate the cellular translational program. However, the molecular players and the mechanisms regulating the gene-specific expression of tRNAs are still unknown. Using an inducible auxin-degron system to rapidly deplete RPB1 (the largest subunit of RNA Pol II) in living cells, we identified Pol II as a direct gene-specific regulator of tRNA transcription. Our data suggest that Pol II transcription robustly interferes with Pol III function at specific tRNA genes. This activity was further found to be essential for MAF1-mediated repression of a large set of tRNA genes during serum starvation, indicating that repression of tRNA genes by Pol II is dynamically regulated. Hence, Pol II plays a direct and central role in the gene-specific regulation of tRNA expression."

  "description": "Alkynamide phthalazinones as a new class of TbrPDEB1 inhibitorsSeveral 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have been validated as good drug targets for a large variety of diseases. Trypanosoma brucei PDEB1 (TbrPDEB1) has been designated as a promising drug target for the treatment of human African trypanosomiasis. Recently, the first class of selective nanomolar TbrPDEB1 inhibitors was obtained by targeting the parasite specific P-pocket. However, these biphenyl-substituted tetrahydrophthalazinone-based inhibitors did not show potent cellular activity against Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) parasites, leaving room for further optimization. Herein, we report the discovery of a new class of potent TbrPDEB1 inhibitors that display improved activities against T. brucei parasites. Exploring different linkers between the reported tetrahydrophthalazinone core scaffold and the amide tail group resulted in the discovery of alkynamide phthalazinones as new TbrPDEB1 inhibitors, which exhibit submicromolar activities versus T. brucei parasites and no cytotoxicity to human MRC-5 cells. Elucidation of the crystal structure of alkynamide 8b (NPD-048) bound to the catalytic domain of TbrPDEB1 shows a bidentate interaction with the key-residue Gln874 and good directionality towards the P-pocket. Incubation of trypanosomes with alkynamide 8b results in an increase of intracellular cAMP, validating a PDE-mediated effect in vitro and providing a new interesting compound series for further studies towards selective TbrPDEB1 inhibitors with potent phenotypic activity."

The recently reported alkynamide tetrahydrophthalazinones, which show submicromolar activities against TbrPDEB1 and anti-T. brucei activity, have been used as starting point for the discovery of new TbrPDEB1 inhibitors. Structure-based design indicated that the alkynamide-nitrogen atom can be readily decorated, leading to the discovery of 37, a potent TbrPDEB1 inhibitor with submicromolar activities against T. brucei parasites. Furthermore, 37 is more potent against TbrPDEB1 than hPDE4 and shows no cytotoxicity on human MRC-5 cells. The crystal structures of the catalytic domain of TbrPDEB1 co-crystalized with several different alkynamides show a bidentate interaction with key-residue Gln874, but no interaction with the parasite-specific P-pocket, despite being (uniquely) a more potent inhibitor for the parasite PDE. Incubation of blood stream form trypanosomes by 37 increases intracellular cAMP levels and results in the distortion of the cell cycle and cell death, validating phosphodiesterase inhibition as mode of action."

  "description": "Efficient Copper-Catalyzed Multicomponent Synthesis of N-Acyl Amidines via Acyl NitrenesDirect synthetic routes to amidines are desired, as they are widely present in many biologically active compounds and organometallic complexes. N-Acyl amidines in particular can be used as a starting material for the synthesis of heterocycles and have several other applications. Here, we describe a fast and practical copper-catalyzed three-component reaction of aryl acetylenes, amines, and easily accessible 1,4,2-dioxazol-5-ones to N-acyl amidines, generating CO2 as the only byproduct. Transformation of the dioxazolones on the Cu catalyst generates acyl nitrenes that rapidly insert into the copper acetylide Cu-C bond rather than undergoing an undesired Curtius rearrangement. For nonaromatic dioxazolones, [Cu(OAc)(Xantphos)] is a superior catalyst for this transformation, leading to full substrate conversion within 10 min. For the direct synthesis of N-benzoyl amidine derivatives from aromatic dioxazolones, [Cu(OAc)(Xantphos)] proved to be inactive, but moderate to good yields were obtained when using simple copper(I) iodide (CuI) as the catalyst. Mechanistic studies revealed the aerobic instability of one of the intermediates at low catalyst loadings, but the reaction could still be performed in air for most substrates when using catalyst loadings of 5 mol %. The herein reported procedure not only provides a new, practical, and direct route to N-acyl amidines but also represents a new type of C-N bond formation."

  "description": "Correlation-coupling entropy as a measure of strong electron correlation and fragment-conditional density spin polarization as a measure of electron entanglementQuantum entanglement has been one of the hottest topics in current day physics, since it is the driving force behind quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and quantum computing. Several measures of quantification of entanglement have been proposed, each of which can often only be applied to a few specific systems. In this paper we derive a kinematic measure of entanglement that is capable of giving a full description of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement in molecular systems. The associated \"coupled entropy\" energy contribution generates the correct amount of strong correlation energy for the H2 and N2 prototype systems, and is shown to be able to perform the same feat if it is explicitly used as the correlation component in the density-matrix functional context. And, finally, we propose a nonkinematic way to measure the entanglement of spins by using the conditional density of the system."

  "description": "Assessing anti-estrogenic effects of AHR ligands in primary human and rat endometrial epithelial cellsUnopposed estrogenic action in the uterus can lead to the development of endometrial cancer in both humans and rats. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation gives rise to anti-estrogenic actions and may consequently reduce the development of endometrial cancer. In this study, the anti-estrogenic potential of the AHR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and DELAQ, a metabolite of the pharmaceutical laquinimod, was assessed in in primary human and rat endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) with and without co-exposure to endogenous hormones. In human EECs, estradiol and progesterone did not affect AHR gene expression, but in rat EECs, progesterone decreased Ahre xpression (1.4-fold). In accordance, AHR-mediated induction of Cyp1a1/1b1 expression by DELAQ and TCDD decreased in hormone-treated rat EECs. DELAQ was 22-fold more potent than TCDD in human EECs in inducing CYP1A1/1B1 gene expression, while DELAQ was approximately 16\u221233-fold less potent than TCDD in rat EECs. In human EECs, 10 nM DELAQ decreased estradiol-induced expression of growth-regulated estrogen receptor binding 1 (GREB1) by 1.8-fold. In rat EECs, both DELAQ and TCDD did not affect the expression of estradiol-induced genes. This study shows that AHR ligand DELAQ, but not TCDD, causes anti-estrogenic effects in primary human EECs. Furthermore, although AHR-mediated CYP1A1/1B1/Cyp1a1/1b1 induction by DELAQ and TCDD was stronger in rat EECs than human EECs, this did not result in apparent anti-estrogenic effects in the rat cells. This study shows that primary human and rat endometrial cells respond differently towards hormones and AHR ligands. This should be considered in human risk assessment based on rodent studies."

  "description": "Development of high-throughput screening assays for profiling snake venom phospholipase A2 activity after chromatographic fractionationMany organisms, ranging from plants to mammals, contain phospholipase A2 enzymes (PLA2s), which catalyze the production of lysophospholipids and fatty acid proinflammatory mediators. PLA2s are also common constituents of animal venoms, including bees, scorpions and snakes, and they cause a wide variety of toxic effects including neuro-, myo-, cyto-, and cardio-toxicity, anticoagulation and edema. The aim of this study was to develop a generic method for profiling enzymatically active PLA2s in snake venoms after chromatographic separation. For this, low-volume high-throughput assays for assessment of enzymatic PLA2 activity were evaluated and optimized. Subsequently, the assays were incorporated into a nanofractionation platform that combines high-resolution fractionation of crude venoms by liquid chromatography (LC) with bioassaying in 384-well plate format, and parallel mass spectrometric (MS) detection for toxin identification. The miniaturized assays developed are based on absorbance or fluorescence detection (respectively, using cresol red or fluorescein as pH indicators) to monitor the pH drop associated with free fatty acid formation by enzymatically active PLA2s. The methodology was demonstrated for assessment of PLA2 activity profiles of venoms from the snake species Bothrops asper, Echis carinatus, Echis coloratus, Echis ocellatus, Oxyuranus scutellatus and Daboia russelii russelii."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

The confirmation of the presence of grafting and the estimation of its extent is challenging. It is complicated by the limited solubility of polymers, their structural dispersity and chemical heterogeneity. Moreover, the starting materials (and other reagents, reaction products and additives) may be present in the product. Reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), hydrophilic-interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) were used to characterize the product, as well as the starting materials. Additionally, fractions were collected for off-line characterization by infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The one-dimensional separation methods were found to be inconclusive regarding the grafting question. Breakthrough (the early elution of polymer fractions due to strong injection solvents) is shown to be a perpetual problem. This issue is not solved by comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC \u00d7 LC), but information demonstrating the success of the grafting reaction could be obtained. SEC \u00d7 RPLC and HILIC \u00d7 RPLC separations are presented and discussed."

  "description": "Neutralizing effects of small molecule inhibitors and metal chelators on coagulopathic Viperinae snake venom toxinsAnimal-derived antivenoms are the only specific therapies currently available for the treatment of snake envenoming, but these products have a number of limitations associated with their efficacy, safety and affordability for use in tropical snakebite victims. Small molecule drugs and drug candidates are regarded as promising alternatives for filling the critical therapeutic gap between snake envenoming and effective treatment. In this study, by using an advanced analytical technique that combines chromatography, mass spectrometry and bioassaying, we investigated the effect of several small molecule inhibitors that target phospholipase A2 (varespladib) and snake venom metalloproteinase (marimastat, dimercaprol and DMPS) toxin families on inhibiting the activities of coagulopathic toxins found in Viperinae snake venoms. The venoms of Echis carinatus, Echis ocellatus, Daboia russelii and Bitis arietans, which are known for their potent haemotoxicities, were fractionated in high resolution onto 384-well plates using liquid chromatography followed by coagulopathic bioassaying of the obtained fractions. Bioassay activities were correlated to parallel recorded mass spectrometric and proteomics data to assign the venom toxins responsible for coagulopathic activity and assess which of these toxins could be neutralized by the inhibitors under investigation. Our results showed that the phospholipase A2-inhibitor varespladib neutralized the vast majority of anticoagulation activities found across all of the tested snake venoms. Of the snake venom metalloproteinase inhibitors, marimastat demonstrated impressive neutralization of the procoagulation activities detected in all of the tested venoms, whereas dimercaprol and DMPS could only partially neutralize these activities at the doses tested. Our results provide additional support for the concept that combinations of small molecules, particularly the combination of varespladib with marimastat, serve as a drug-repurposing opportunity to develop new broad-spectrum inhibitor-based therapies for snakebite envenoming."

  "description": "Novel brominated flame retardants - A review of their occurrence in indoor air, dust, consumer goods and foodThis critical review summarizes the occurrence of 63 novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) in indoor air, dust, consumer goods and food. It includes their EU registration and (potential) risks. The increasing application of NBFRs calls for more research on their occurrence, environmental fate and toxicity. This review reports which NBFRs are actually being studied, which are detected and which are of most concern. It also connects data from the European Chemical Association on NBFRs with other scientific information. Large knowledge gaps emerged for 28 (out of 63) NBFRs, which were not included in any monitoring programs or other studies. This also indicates the need for optimized analytical methods including all NBFRs. Further research on indoor environments, emission sources and potential leaching is also necessary. High concentrations of 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EH-TBB), bis(2-ethylhexyl)tetrabromophthalate (BEH-TEBP), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) were often reported. The detection of hexabromobenzene (HBB), pentabromotoluene (PBT), 1,4-dimethyltetrabromobenzene (TBX), 4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)-1,2-dibromocyclohexane (DBE-DBCH) and tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2,3-dibromopropyl) ether (TBBPA-BDBPE) also raises concern."

However, birth cohort findings have been conflicting. This study aimed to (i) investigate the interplay between maternal prenatal phthalate levels, infant genetic vulnerability to oxidative stress, and child neurodevelopment and (ii) examine combined putative oxidant exposures. In a population-based birth cohort of 1064 women with prenatal recruitment in Victoria, Australia, maternal urine was collected at 36 weeks of pregnancy and phthalate metabolite concentrations measured. An unweighted genetic score for oxidative stress was made using a candidate gene approach. Cognition was assessed using the BAYLEY-III at two years (n = 678). Parents completed questionnaires for doctor diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (1.4 %), ASD traits (4.9 %) and child inattention/hyperactivity (n = 791). Analyses included multiple linear and logistic regression. Higher prenatal phthalate levels and a higher oxidative stress genetic score were each associated with subsequent ASD. Several oxidative stress-related SNPs modified the association between prenatal phthalates and ASD and other outcomes. Consistent patterns were evident across gene score-phthalate combinations for cognition, ASD, ASD traits and inattention/hyperactivity. Other putative oxidant factors such as prenatal smoking further increased risk. Prenatal phthalate levels and infant oxidative stress-related genetic vulnerability are associated with adverse neurodevelopment. Combined exposures are important. Current recommendations and regulation on maternal phthalate exposure during pregnancy require re-evaluation."

  "description": "Structure and Function of the Mycobacterial Type VII Secretion SystemsBacteria have evolved intricate secretion machineries for the successful delivery of large molecules across their cell envelopes. Such specialized secretion systems allow a variety of bacteria to thrive in specific host environments. In mycobacteria, type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) are dedicated protein transport machineries that fulfill diverse and crucial roles, ranging from metabolite uptake to immune evasion and subversion to conjugation. Since the discovery of mycobacterial T7SSs about 15 y ago, genetic, structural, and functional studies have provided insight into the roles and functioning of these secretion machineries. Here, we focus on recent advances in the elucidation of the structure and mechanism of mycobacterial T7SSs in protein secretion. As many of these systems are essential for mycobacterial growth or virulence, they provide opportunities for the development of novel therapies to combat a number of relevant mycobacterial diseases.

These unique nanocarriers reflect cellular topology and can systemically transport functionally competent transmembrane receptors, ligands, and a cargo of signal proteins. Recent developments hint at roles for GPCRs in the EV life cycle and, conversely, at roles for EVs in GPCR signal transduction.

  "description": "Human multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) is a cellular efflux transporter for paracetamol glutathione and cysteine conjugatesParacetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) overdose is a leading cause of acute drug-induced liver failure. APAP hepatotoxicity is mediated by the reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is inactivated by conjugation with glutathione (GSH) to APAP-GSH, which is further converted into its cysteine derivative APAP-CYS. Before necrosis of hepatocytes occurs, APAP-CYS is measurable in plasma of the affected patient and it has been proposed as an early biomarker of acetaminophen toxicity. APAP-GSH and APAP-CYS can be extruded by hepatocytes, but the transporters involved are unknown. In this study we examined whether ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a role in the cellular efflux of APAP, APAP-GSH, and APAP-CYS. The ABC transport proteins P-gp/ABCB1, BSEP/ABCB11, BCRP/ABCG2, and MRP/ABCC1-5 were overexpressed in HEK293 cells and membrane vesicles were produced. Whereas P-gp, BSEP, MRP3, MRP5, and BCRP did not transport any of the compounds, uptake of APAP-GSH was found for MRP1, MRP2 and MRP4. APAP-CYS appeared to be a substrate of MRP4 and none of the ABC proteins transported APAP. The results suggest that the NAPQI metabolite APAP-CYS can be excreted into plasma by MRP4, where it could be a useful biomarker for APAP exposure and toxicity. Characterization of the cellular efflux of APAP-CYS is important for its development as a biomarker, because plasma concentrations might be influenced by drug-transporter interactions and upregulation of MRP4."

  "description": "N-Heterocyclic Silylenes as Ligands in Transition Metal Carbonyl Chemistry: Nature of Their Bonding and Supposed InnocenceA study on the reactivity of the N-heterocyclic silylene Dipp2NHSi (1,3-bis(diisopropylphenyl)-1,3-diaza-2-silacyclopent-4-en-2-yliden) with the transition metal complexes [Ni(CO)4], [M(CO)6] (M=Cr, Mo, W), [Mn(CO)5(Br)] and [(\u03b75-C5H5)Fe(CO)2(I)] is reported. We demonstrate that N-heterocyclic silylenes, the higher homologues of the now ubiquitous NHC ligands, show a remarkably different behavior in coordination chemistry compared to NHC ligands. Calculations on the electronic features of these ligands revealed significant differences in the frontier orbital region which lead to some peculiarities of the coordination chemistry of silylenes, as demonstrated by the synthesis of the dinuclear, NHSi-bridged complex [{Ni(CO)2(\u03bc-Dipp2NHSi)}2] (2), complexes [M(CO)5(Dipp2NHSi)] (M=Cr 3, Mo 4, W 5), [Mn(CO)3(Dipp2NHSi)2(Br)] (9) and [(\u03b75-C5H5)Fe(CO)2(Dipp2NHSi-I)] (10). DFT calculations on several model systems [Ni(L)], [Ni(CO)3(L)], and [W(CO)5(L)] (L=NHC, NHSi) reveal that carbenes are typically the much better donor ligands with a larger intrinsic strength of the metal\u2013ligand bond. The decrease going from the carbene to the silylene ligand is mainly caused by favorable electrostatic contributions for the NHC ligand to the total bond strength, whereas the orbital interactions were often found to be higher for the silylene complexes. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the contribution of \u03c3- and \u03c0-interaction depends significantly on the system under investigation. The \u03c3-interaction is often much weaker for the NHSi ligand compared to NHC but, interestingly, the \u03c0-interaction prevails for many NHSi complexes. For the carbonyl complexes, the NHSi ligand is the better \u03c3-donor ligand, and contributions of \u03c0-symmetry play only a minor role for the NHC and NHSi co-ligands."

  "description": "Understanding the 1,3-Dipolar Cycloadditions of AllenesWe have quantum chemically studied the reactivity, site-, and regioselectivity of the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between methyl azide and various allenes, including the archetypal allene propadiene, heteroallenes, and cyclic allenes, by using density functional theory (DFT). The 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactivity of linear (hetero)allenes decreases as the number of heteroatoms in the allene increases, and formation of the 1,5-adduct is, in all cases, favored over the 1,4-adduct. Both effects find their origin in the strength of the primary orbital interactions. The cycloaddition reactivity of cyclic allenes was also investigated, and the increased predistortion of allenes, that results upon cyclization, leads to systematically lower activation barriers not due to the expected variations in the strain energy, but instead from the differences in the interaction energy. The geometric predistortion of cyclic allenes enhances the reactivity compared to linear allenes through a unique mechanism that involves a smaller HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, which manifests as more stabilizing orbital interactions."

  "description": "Comparative metathermodynamic description of thermal and correlation electron effectsUnified metathermodynamic description of thermal and correlation electron effects is proposed. It is based on the temperature-dependent populations of the common for all temperatures basis states of the (formally accurate) configuration interaction (CI) expansion of the components of the canonical ensemble. These populations are incorporated into the effective ensemble of the metathermodynamic approach through the partial effective tem- peratures. The extended temperature Te is introduced as the statistical average of those temperatures. The absolute zero of the Te scale represents a \"no-correlation\"Hartree-Fock state, while elevated Te describes the increase of the \"correlation motion\"and the conventional thermal motion. The diagonal double configuration interaction (DDCI) approximation is considered, in which the proposed metathermodynamic description of thermal and correlation electron effects is based on the temperature-dependent orbital populations."

  "description": "Environmental Effects with Frozen-Density Embedding in Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory Using Localized Basis FunctionsFrozen-density embedding (FDE) represents a versatile embedding scheme to describe the environmental effect on electron dynamics in molecular systems. The extension of the general theory of FDE to the real-time time-dependent Kohn-Sham method has previously been presented and implemented in plane waves and periodic boundary conditions [Pavanello, M.; J. Chem. Phys. 2015, 142, 154116]. In the current paper, we extend our recent formulation of the real-time time-dependent Kohn-Sham method based on localized basis set functions and developed within the Psi4NumPy framework to the FDE scheme. The latter has been implemented in its \"uncoupled\" flavor (in which the time evolution is only carried out for the active subsystem, while the environment subsystems remain at their ground state), using and adapting the FDE implementation already available in the PyEmbed module of the scripting framework PyADF. The implementation was facilitated by the fact that both Psi4NumPy and PyADF, being native Python API, provided an ideal framework of development using the Python advantages in terms of code readability and reusability. We employed this new implementation to investigate the stability of the time-propagation procedure, which is based on an efficient predictor/corrector second-order midpoint Magnus propagator employing an exact diagonalization, in combination with the FDE scheme. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the FDE potential does not introduce any numerical instability in time propagation of the density matrix of the active subsystem, and in the limit of the weak external field, the numerical results for low-lying transition energies are consistent with those obtained using the reference FDE calculations based on the linear-response TDDFT. The method is found to give stable numerical results also in the presence of a strong external field inducing nonlinear effects. Preliminary results are reported for high harmonic generation (HHG) of a water molecule embedded in a small water cluster. The effect of the embedding potential is evident in the HHG spectrum reducing the number of the well-resolved high harmonics at high energy with respect to the free water. This is consistent with a shift toward lower ionization energy passing from an isolated water molecule to a small water cluster. The computational burden for the propagation step increases approximately linearly with the size of the surrounding frozen environment. Furthermore, we have also shown that the updating frequency of the embedding potential may be significantly reduced, much less than one per time step, without jeopardizing the accuracy of the transition energies."

  "description": "Light-Matter Hybrid-Orbital-Based First-Principles Methods: The Influence of Polariton StatisticsA detailed understanding of strong matter-photon interactions requires first-principle methods that can solve the fundamental Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics efficiently. A possible way to extend well-established electronic-structure methods to this situation is to embed the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in a higher-dimensional light-matter hybrid auxiliary configuration space. In this work we show the importance of the resulting hybrid Fermi-Bose statistics of the polaritons, which are the new fundamental particles of the \"photon-dressed\" Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for systems in cavities. We show that violations of these statistics can lead to unphysical results. We present an efficient way to ensure the correct statistics by enforcing representability conditions on the dressed one-body reduced density matrix. We further present a general prescription how to extend a given first-principles approach to polaritons and as an example introduce polaritonic Hartree-Fock theory. While being a single-reference method in polariton space, polaritonic Hartree-Fock is a multireference method in the electronic space, i.e., it describes electronic correlations. We also discuss possible applications to polaritonic QEDFT. We apply this theory to a lattice model and find that, the more delocalized the bound-state wave function of the particles is, the stronger it reacts to photons. The main reason is that within a small energy range, many states with different electronic configurations are available as opposed to a strongly bound (and hence energetically separated) ground-state wave function. This indicates that under certain conditions coupling to the quantum vacuum of a cavity can indeed modify ground state properties."

  "description": "Advancements in effect-based surface water quality assessmentLegally-prescribed chemical monitoring is unfit for determining the pollution status of surface waters, and there is a need for improved assessment methods that consider the aggregated risk of all bioavailable micropollutants present in the aquatic environment. Therefore, the present study aimed to advance effect-based water quality assessment by implementing methodological improvements and to gain insight into contamination source-specific bioanalytical responses. Passive sampling of non-polar and polar organic compounds and metals was applied at 14 surface water locations that were characterized by two major anthropogenic contamination sources, agriculture and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, as well as reference locations with a low expected impact from micropollutants. Departing from the experience gained in previous studies, a battery of 20 in vivo and in vitro bioassays was composed and subsequently exposed to the passive sampler extracts. Next, the bioanalytical responses were divided by their respective effect-based trigger values to obtain effect-based risk quotients, which were summed per location. These cumulative ecotoxicological risks were lowest for reference locations (4.3\u201310.9), followed by agriculture locations (11.3\u201327.2) and the highest for WWTP locations (12.8\u201347.7), and were mainly driven by polar organic contaminants. The bioanalytical assessment of the joint risks of metals and (non-)polar organic compounds resulted in the successful identification of pollution source-specific ecotoxicological risk profiles: none of the bioassays were significantly associated with reference locations nor with multiple location types, while horticulture locations were significantly characterized by anti-AR and anti-PR activity and cytotoxicity, and WWTP sites by ER\u03b1 activity and toxicity in the in vivo bioassays. It is concluded that the presently employed advanced effect-based methods can readily be applied in surface water quality assessment and that the integration of chemical- and effect-based monitoring approaches will foster future-proof water quality assessment strategies on the road to a non-toxic environment."

  "description": "Effect of Alkali Metal Cations on Length and Strength of Hydrogen Bonds in DNA Base PairsFor many years, non-covalently bonded complexes of nucleobases have attracted considerable interest. However, there is a lack of information about the nature of hydrogen bonding between nucleobases when the bonding is affected by metal coordination to one of the nucleobases, and how the individual hydrogen bonds and aromaticity of nucleobases respond to the presence of the metal cation. Here we report a DFT computational study of nucleobase pairs interacting with alkali metal cations. The metal cations contribute to the stabilization of the base pairs to varying degrees depending on their position. The energy decomposition analysis revealed that the nature of bonding between nucleobases does not change much upon metal coordination. The effect of the cations on individual hydrogen bonds were described by changes in VDD charges on frontier atoms, H-bond length, bond energy from NBO analysis, and the delocalization index from QTAIM calculations. The aromaticity changes were determined by a HOMA index."

Incorporating noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into enzymes enables a dramatic expansion of their catalytic features. For this, quick identification of fully translated and correctly folded variants is decisive. Herein, we report the engineering of the enantioselectivity of an esterase utilizing several ncAAs. Key for the identification of active and soluble protein variants was the use of the split-GFP method, which is crucial as it allows simple determination of the expression levels of enzyme variants with ncAA incorporations by fluorescence. Several identified variants led to improved enantioselectivity or even inverted enantiopreference in the kinetic resolution of ethyl 3-phenylbutyrate."

Firstly, novel carbohydrate-functionalized methacrylate monomers were synthesized through Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (alkyne-azide reaction) of terminal alkyne with azide of carbohydrate derivatives. The corresponding carbohydrate functionalized monolithic columns were then prepared through a single-step in-situ copolymerization. The physicochemical properties and performance of the fabricated monolithic columns were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and nano-liquid chromatography. For the optimized monolithic column, satisfactory column permeability and good separation performance were demonstrated for polar compounds including nucleoside, phenolic compounds and benzoic acid derivatives. The monolithic column is also highly useful for selective and efficient enrichment of glycopeptides from human IgG tryptic digests. This study not only provided a novel hydrophilic column for separation and selective trapping of polar compounds, but also proposed a facile and efficient approach for preparing carbohydrate functionalized monoliths."

  "description": "Posttranslational insertion of small membrane proteins by the bacterial signal recognition particleSmall membrane proteins represent a largely unexplored yet abundant class of proteins in pro- and eukaryotes. They essentially consist of a single transmembrane domain and are associated with stress response mechanisms in bacteria. How these proteins are inserted into the bacterial membrane is unknown. Our study revealed that in Escherichia coli, the 27- amino-acid-long model protein YohP is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), as indicated by in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking. Cross-links to SRP were also observed for a second small membrane protein, the 33-amino-acid-long YkgR. However, in contrast to the canonical cotranslational recognition by SRP, SRP was found to bind to YohP posttranslationally. In vitro protein transport assays in the presence of a SecY inhibitor and proteoliposome studies demonstrated that SRP and its receptor FtsY are essential for the posttranslational membrane insertion of YohP by either the SecYEG translocon or by the YidC insertase. Furthermore, our data showed that the yohP mRNA localized preferentially and translation-independently to the bacterial membrane in vivo. In summary, our data revealed that YohP engages an unique SRP-dependent posttranslational insertion pathway that is likely preceded by an mRNA targeting step. This further highlights the enormous plasticity of bacterial protein transport machineries. "

  "description": "Conventional and high resolution chemical characterization to assess refinery effluent treatment performanceRefinery effluents represent an emission source of hydrocarbons (HCs) and other constituents to the environment. Thus, characterisation of effluent quality in terms of concentrations of key parameters relative to permitted standards is important and for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), the specific composition of the HC mixture can affect its toxicity to aquatic organisms. Therefore, this study was designed to analyse TPH, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes (BTEX), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), (bio) chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total suspended solids and selected metals before, and after, treatment steps to demonstrate removal efficiencies across 13 refineries with variable wastewater treatment systems. Final discharge concentrations of the measured parameters were by 97% within the so called Best Available Technique Associated Emission Levels (BAT-AELs). Further, TPH composition was characterised using high-resolution two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) analysis to understand the mass distribution by carbon number and specific chemical class. Measurements were compared to SimpleTreat model predictions for validation. SimpleTreat successfully predicted the shape of the effluent composition since it is essentially a removal constant applied to the influent composition. The predictions were of similar magnitude as, or were greater than, the effluent concentrations since SimpleTreat is based on typical performance and is intended to be conservative. This was especially true for aromatic constituents. Reduction in potential HC exposures also coincided with a decrease in predicted toxicity using a mechanistic oil toxicity model, PETROTOX. Overall, the results indicate that EU petroleum refineries are likely to achieve a high performance level regarding effluent treatment."

  "description": "Ion Homeostasis and Metabolome Analysis of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 Quadruple Mutants to Salt StressSalinity is one of the major abiotic stresses that limits agricultural productivity worldwide. Many proteins with defined functions in salt stress adaptation are controlled through interactions with members of the 14-3-3 family. In the present study, we generated three 14-3-3 quadruple knockout mutants (qKOs: klpc, klun, and unpc) to study the role of six non-epsilon group 14-3-3 proteins for salt stress adaptation. The relative growth inhibition under 100 mM of NaCl stress was the same for wild-type (Wt) and qKOs, but the accumulation of Na+ in the shoots of klpc was significantly lower than that in Wt. This difference correlated with the higher expression of the HKT1 gene in klpc. Considering the regulatory role of 14-3-3 proteins in metabolism and the effect of salt stress on metabolite accumulation, we analyzed the effect of a 24-h salt treatment on the root metabolome of nutrient solution-grown genotypes. The results indicated that the klpc mutant had metabolome responses that were different from those of Wt. Notably, the reducing sugars, glucose and fructose, were lower in klpc under control and salt stress. On the other hand, their phosphorylated forms, glucose-6P and fructose-6P, were lower under salt stress as compared to Wt. This study provided insight into the functions of the 14-3-3 proteins from non-epsilon group members. In summary, it was found that these proteins control ion homeostasis and metabolite composition under salt stress conditions and non-stressed conditions. The analyses of single, double, and triple mutants that modify subsets from the most effective qKO mutant (klpc) may also reveal the potential redundancy for the observed phenotypes."

  "description": "Low-Order Scaling Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW for MoleculesLow-order scaling GW implementations for molecules are usually restricted to approximations with diagonal self-energy. Here, we present an all-electron implementation of quasiparticle self-consistent GW for molecular systems. We use an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the self-energy in imaginary time, from which a static non-local exchange-correlation potential is calculated via analytical continuation. By using a direct inversion of iterative subspace method, fast and stable convergence is achieved for almost all molecules in the GW100 database. Exceptions are systems which are associated with a breakdown of the single quasiparticle picture in the valence region. The implementation is proven to be starting point independent and good agreement of QP energies with other codes is observed. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the new implementation by calculating the quasiparticle spectrum of a DNA oligomer with 1,220 electrons using a basis of 6,300 atomic orbitals in less than 4days on a single compute node with 16 cores. We use then our implementation to study the dependence of quasiparticle energies of DNA oligomers consisting of adenine-thymine pairs on the oligomer size. The first ionization potential in vacuum decreases by nearly 1 electron volt and the electron affinity increases by 0.4eV going from the smallest to the largest considered oligomer. This shows that the DNA environment stabilizes the hole/electron resulting from photoexcitation/photoattachment. Upon inclusion of the aqueous environment via a polarizable continuum model, the differences between the ionization potentials reduce to 130meV, demonstrating that the solvent effectively compensates for the stabilizing effect of the DNA environment. The electron affinities of the different oligomers are almost identical in the aqueous environment."

  "description": "Orbital transformations to reduce the 1-norm of the electronic structure Hamiltonian for quantum computing applicationsReducing the complexity of quantum algorithms to treat quantum chemistry problems is essential to demonstrate an eventual quantum advantage of noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices over their classical counterpart. Significant improvements have been made recently to simulate the time-evolution operator U(t)=ei\u0124t, where \u0124 is the electronic structure Hamiltonian, or to simulate \u0124 directly (when written as a linear combination of unitaries) by using block encoding or qubitization techniques. A fundamental measure quantifying the practical implementation complexity of these quantum algorithms is the so-called 1-norm of the qubit representation of the Hamiltonian, which can be reduced by writing the Hamiltonian in factorized or tensor-hypercontracted forms, for instance. In this paper, we investigate the effect of classical preoptimization of the electronic structure Hamiltonian representation, via single-particle basis transformation, on the 1-norm. Specifically, we employ several localization schemes and benchmark the 1-norm of several systems of different sizes (number of atoms and active space sizes). We also derive a formula for the 1-norm as a function of the electronic integrals and use this quantity as a cost function for an orbital-optimization scheme that improves over localization schemes. This paper gives more insights about the importance of the 1-norm in quantum computing for quantum chemistry and provides simple ways of decreasing its value to reduce the complexity of quantum algorithms."

  "description": "The EU chemicals strategy for sustainability: in support of the BfR positionThe EU chemicals strategy for sustainability (CSS) asserts that both human health and the environment are presently threatened and that further regulation is necessary. In a recent Guest Editorial, members of the German competent authority for risk assessment, the BfR, raised concerns about the scientific justification for this strategy. The complexity and interdependence of the networks of regulation of chemical substances have ensured that public health and wellbeing in the EU have continuously improved. A continuous process of improvement in consumer protection is clearly desirable but any initiative directed towards this objective must be based on scientific knowledge. It must not confound risk with other factors in determining policy. This conclusion is fully supported in the present Commentary including the request to improve both, data collection and the time-consuming and bureaucratic procedures that delay the publication of regulations."

  "description": "Effects of ligands on (de-)enhancement of plasmonic excitations of silver, gold and bimetallic nanoclusters: TD-DFT+TB calculationsMetal nanoclusters can be synthesized in various sizes and shapes and are typically protected with ligands to stabilize them. These ligands can also be used to tune the plasmonic properties of the clusters as the absorption spectrum of a protected cluster can be significantly altered compared to the bare cluster. In this paper, we computationally investigate the influence of thiolate ligands on the plasmonic intensity for silver, gold and alloy clusters. Using time-dependent density functional theory with tight-binding approximations, TD-DFT+TB, we show that this level of theory can reproduce the broad experimental spectra of Au144(SR)60 and Ag53Au91(SR)60 (R = CH3) compounds with satisfactory agreement. As TD-DFT+TB does not depend on atom-type parameters we were able to apply this approach on large ligand-protected clusters with various compositions. With these calculations we predict that the effect of ligands on the absorption can be a quenching as well as an enhancement. We furthermore show that it is possible to unambiguously identify the plasmonic peaks by the scaled Coulomb kernel technique and explain the influence of ligands on the intensity (de-)enhancement by analyzing the plasmonic excitations in terms of the dominant orbital contributions."

  "description": "Origin of the \u03b1-Effect in SN2 ReactionsThe \u03b1-effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of \u03b1-nucleophiles (R\u2212Y\u2212X:\u2212) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R\u2212X:\u2212) by deviating from the classical Br\u00f8nsted-type reactivity-basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the \u03b1-effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including O-, N- and S-based normal and \u03b1-nucleophiles, participating in an SN2 reaction with ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an \u03b1-nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show \u03b1-effect: (i) a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied\u2013occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii) a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO\u2013LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO\u2013LUMO orbital energy gap. If one of these two criteria is not fulfilled, one can expect no \u03b1-effect or inverse \u03b1-effect."

  "description": "Implementation of Relativistic Coupled Cluster Theory for Massively Parallel GPU-Accelerated Computing ArchitecturesIn this paper, we report reimplementation of the core algorithms of relativistic coupled cluster theory aimed at modern heterogeneous high-performance computational infrastructures. The code is designed for parallel execution on many compute nodes with optional GPU coprocessing, accomplished via the new ExaTENSOR back end. The resulting ExaCorr module is primarily intended for calculations of molecules with one or more heavy elements, as relativistic effects on the electronic structure are included from the outset. In the current work, we thereby focus on exact two-component methods and demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the software. The module can be used as a stand-alone program requiring a set of molecular orbital coefficients as the starting point, but it is also interfaced to the DIRAC program that can be used to generate these. We therefore also briefly discuss an improvement of the parallel computing aspects of the relativistic self-consistent field algorithm of the DIRAC program."

This behavior can be considered as a \u201cweak\u201d form of bond stretch isomerism. Our computations reveal that complexes RCN\u2212BX3 (R=CH3, FCH2, BrCH2, and X=Cl, Br) exhibit a fast interconversion from LB to SB geometries even close to the absolute zero thanks to a boron atom tunneling mechanism. The computed half-lives of the meta-stable LB compounds vary between minutes to nanoseconds at cryogenic conditions. Accordingly, we predict that the long bond structures are practically impossible to isolate or characterize, which agrees with previous matrix-isolation experiments."

  "description": "Origin of asynchronicity in Diels-Alder reactionsAsynchronicity in Diels-Alder reactions plays a crucial role in determining the height of the reaction barrier. Currently, the origin of asynchronicity is ascribed to the stronger orbital interaction between the diene and the terminal carbon of an asymmetric dienophile, which shortens the corresponding newly formed C-C bond and hence induces asynchronicity in the reaction. Here, we show, using the activation strain model and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital theory at ZORA-BP86/TZ2P, that this rationale behind asynchronicity is incorrect. We, in fact, found that following a more asynchronous reaction mode costs favorable HOMO-LUMO orbital overlap and, therefore, weakens (not strengthens) these orbital interactions. Instead, it is the Pauli repulsion that induces asynchronicity in Diels-Alder reactions. An asynchronous reaction pathway also lowers repulsive occupied-occupied orbital overlap which, therefore, reduces the unfavorable Pauli repulsion. As soon as this mechanism of reducing Pauli repulsion dominates, the reaction begins to deviate from synchronicity and adopts an asynchronous mode. The eventual degree of asynchronicity, as observed in the transition state of a Diels-Alder reaction, is ultimately achieved when the gain in stability, as a response to the reduced Pauli repulsion, balances with the loss of favorable orbital interactions."

  "description": "Mycosins are required for the stabilization of the ESX-1 and ESX-5 type VII secretion membrane complexes.Pathogenic mycobacteria contain up to five type VII secretion (T7S) systems, ESX-1 to ESX-5. One of the conserved T7S components is the serine protease mycosin (MycP). Strikingly, whereas MycP is essential for secretion, the protease activity of MycP1 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been shown to be dispensable for secretion. The essential role of MycP therefore remains unclear. Here we show that MycP1 and MycP5 of M. marinum have similar phenotypes, confirming that MycP has a second unknown function that is essential for its T7S system. To investigate whether this role is related to proper functioning of the T7S membrane complex, we first analyzed the composition of the ESX-1 membrane complex and showed that this complex consists of EccBCDE1, similarly to what was previously shown for ESX-5. Surprisingly, while mycosins are not an integral part of these purified core complexes, we noticed that the stability of both the ESX-1 complex and the ESX-5 complex is compromised in the absence of their MycP subunit. Additional interaction studies showed that, although mycosins are not part of the central ESX membrane complex, they loosely associate with this complex. We hypothesize that this MycP association with the core membrane complex is crucial for the integrity and functioning of the T7S machinery."

  "description": "Integrating Candida albicans metabolism with biofilm heterogeneity by transcriptome mappingCandida albicans biofilm formation is an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of disease, a characteristic which has been shown to be heterogeneous in clinical isolates. Using an unbiased computational approach we investigated the central metabolic pathways driving biofilm heterogeneity. Transcripts from high (HBF) and low (LBF) biofilm forming isolates were analysed by RNA sequencing, with 6312 genes identified to be expressed in these two phenotypes. With a dedicated computational approach we identified and validated a significantly differentially expressed subnetwork of genes associated with these biofilm phenotypes. Our analysis revealed amino acid metabolism, such as arginine, proline, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, were predominantly upregulated in the HBF phenotype. On the contrary, purine, starch and sucrose metabolism was generally upregulated in the LBF phenotype. The aspartate aminotransferase gene AAT1 was found to be a common member of these amino acid pathways and significantly upregulated in the HBF phenotype. Pharmacological inhibition of AAT1 enzyme activity significantly reduced biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that biofilm phenotype is associated with differential regulation of metabolic pathways. Understanding and targeting such pathways, such as amino acid metabolism, is potentially useful for developing diagnostics and new antifungals to treat biofilm-based infections."

  "description": "CXCR4-Specific Nanobodies as Potential Therapeutics for WHIM syndromeWHIM syndrome is a rare congenital immunodeficiency disease, named after its main clinical manifestations: warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis, which refers to abnormal accumulation of mature neutrophils in the bone marrow. The disease is primarily caused by C-terminal truncation mutations of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, giving these CXCR4-WHIM mutants a gain of function in response to their ligand CXCL12. Considering the broad functions of CXCR4 in maintaining leukocyte homeostasis, patients are panleukopenic and display altered immune responses, likely as a consequence of impairment in the differentiation and trafficking of leukocytes. Treatment of WHIM patients currently consists of symptom relief, leading to unsatisfactory clinical responses. As an alternative and potentially more effective approach, we tested the potency and efficacy of CXCR4-specific nanobodies on inhibiting CXCR4-WHIM mutants. Nanobodies are therapeutic proteins based on the smallest functional fragments of heavy chain antibodies. They combine the advantages of small-molecule drugs and antibody-based therapeutics due to their relative small size, high stability, and high affinity. We compared the potential of monovalent and bivalent CXCR4-specific nanobodies to inhibit CXCL12-induced CXCR4-WHIM-mediated signaling with the small-molecule clinical candidate AMD3100. The CXCR4-targeting nanobodies displace CXCL12 binding and bind CXCR4-wild type and CXCR4-WHIM (R334X/S338X) mutants and with (sub-) nanomolar affinities. The nanobodies' epitope was mapped to extracellular loop 2 of CXCR4, overlapping with the binding site of CXCL12. Monovalent, and in particular bivalent, nanobodies were more potent than AMD3100 in reducing CXCL12-mediated G protein activation. In addition, CXCR4-WHIM-dependent calcium flux and wound healing of human papillomavirus-immortalized cell lines in response to CXCL12 was effectively inhibited by the nanobodies. Based on these in vitro results, we conclude that CXCR4 nanobodies hold significant potential as alternative therapeutics for CXCR4-associated diseases such as WHIM syndrome."

  "description": "In silico screening of antimalarial from indonesian medicinal plants database to plasmepsin targetObjective: Malaria is a disease that impacts millions of people annually. Among the enzymes, plasmepsin is the main enzyme in the plasmodium life cycle that degrades hemoglobin during the erythrocytic phase in the food vacuole. Recently, pharmaceutical industries have been trying to develop therapeutic agents that can cure malaria through the discovery of new plasmepsin inhibitor compounds. One of the developing approaches is the in silico method. Methods: The chosen in silico screening method in this experiment is a structure-based screening using GOLD software and the Indonesian medicinal plants database. Results: From ten in silico screening runs, three of the compounds always ranked in the top ten. These three compounds are trimyristin, cyanidin 3,5-di-(6-malonylglucoside), and isoscutellarein 4\u2019-methyl ether 8-(6\u201d-n-butylglucuronide). Another compound that emerged with high frequency is cyanidin 3,5-di-(6-malonylglucoside). Conclusions: Based on the results obtained from this screening, 11 inhibitor candidates are expected to be developed as antimalarial. These compounds are trimyristin; cyanidin 3,5-di-(6-malonylglucoside); isoscutellarein 4\u2019-methyl ether 8-(6\u201d-n-butylglucuronide); cyanidin 3-(6\u201d-malonylglucoside)-5-glucoside; multifloroside; delphinidin 3-(2-rhamnosyl-6-malonylglucoside); delphinidin 3-(6-malonylglucoside)-3\u2019,5\u2019-di-(6-p-coumaroylglucoside); cyanidin 3-[6-(6-sinapylglucosyl)-2-xylosylgalactoside; kaempferol 3-glucosyl-(1-3)-rhamnosyl-(1-6)-galactoside; sanggenofuran A; and lycopene with a GOLD score range from 78.4647 to 98.2836. Two of them, Asp34 and Asp214, bind with all residues in the catalytic site of plasmepsin."

  "description": "The clinical pharmacology of non-sedating antihistaminesWe previously reported on brain H1 receptor occupancy measurements of antihistamines in human brain using [11C]doxepin and positron emission tomography (PET). We proposed the use of brain H1 receptor occupancy to classify antihistamines objectively into three categories of sedating, less-sedating, and non-sedating antihistamines according to their sedative effects. Non-sedating antihistamines are recommended for the treatment of allergies such as pollinosis and atopic dermatitis because of their low penetration into the central nervous system. Physicians and pharmacists are responsible for fully educating patients about the risks of sedating antihistamines from pharmacological points of view. If a sedating antihistamine must be prescribed, its sedative effects should be thoroughly considered before choosing the drug. Non-sedating antihistamines should be preferentially used whenever possible as most antihistamines are equally efficacious, while adverse effects of sedating antihistamines can be serious. This review summarizes the pharmacological properties of clinically useful non-sedating antihistamines from the perspective of histamine function in the CNS."

Understanding their atomistic origin and manipulating them chemically have capital importance to design defect-free colloidal quantum dots and make a leap forward in the development of efficient optoelectronic devices. Recent advances in computing power established computational chemistry as a powerful tool to describe accurately complex chemical species and nowadays it became conceivable to model colloidal quantum dots with realistic sizes and shapes. In this Perspective, we combine the knowledge gathered in recent experimental findings with the computation of quantum dot electronic structures. We analyze three different systems: namely, CdSe, PbS, and CsPbI3 as benchmark semiconductor nanocrystals showing how different types of trap states can form at their surface. In addition, we suggest experimental healing of such traps according to their chemical origin and nanocrystal composition."

  "description": "Alkali Metal Cation Affinities of Anionic Main Group-Element Hydrides Across the Periodic TableWe have carried out an extensive exploration of gas-phase alkali metal cation affinities (AMCA) of archetypal anionic bases across the periodic system using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-BP86/QZ4P//ZORA-BP86/TZ2P. AMCA values of all bases were computed for the lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium cations and compared with the corresponding proton affinities (PA). One purpose of this work is to provide an intrinsically consistent set of values of the 298 K AMCAs of all anionic (XHn-1         \u2212) constituted by main group-element hydrides of groups 14\u201317 along the periods 2\u20136. In particular, we wish to establish the trend in affinity for a cation as the latter varies from proton to, and along, the alkali cations. Our main purpose is to understand these trends in terms of the underlying bonding mechanism using Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory together with a quantitative bond energy decomposition analyses (EDA)."

  "description": "Macrocycles All Aflutter: Substitution at an Allylic Center Reveals the Conformational Dynamics of [13]-MacrodilactonesThe shapes adopted by large-ring macrocyclic compounds play a role in their reactivity and their ability to be bound by biomolecules. We investigated the synthesis, conformational analysis, and properties of a specific family of [13]-macrodilactones as models of natural-product macrocycles. The features of our macrodilactones enabled us to study the relationship between stereogenic centers and planar chirality through the modular synthesis of new members of this family of macrocycles. Here we report on insights gained from a new [13]-macrodilactone that is substituted at a position adjacent to the alkene in the molecule. Analysis of the compound, in comparison to an \u03b1-substituted regioisomer, by using X-ray crystallography, NMR coupling constants, and reaction-product characterization in concert with computational chemistry, revealed that the alkene unit is dynamic. That is, the data support a model in which the alkene in our [13]-macrodilactones oscillates between two conformations. A difference in reactivity of one conformation compared to the other leads to manifestation of this dynamic behavior. The results underscore the local conformational dynamics observed in some natural-product macrocycles, which could have implications for biomolecule binding."

  "description": "Continuous-wave infrared optical gain and amplified spontaneous emission at ultralow threshold by colloidal HgTe quantum dotsColloidal quantum dots (QDs) raise more and more interest as solution-processable and tunable optical gain materials. However, especially for infrared active QDs, optical gain remains inefficient. Since stimulated emission involves multifold degenerate band-edge states, population inversion can be attained only at high pump power and must compete with efficient multi-exciton recombination. Here, we show that mercury telluride (HgTe) QDs exhibit size-tunable stimulated emission throughout the near-infrared telecom window at thresholds unmatched by any QD studied before. We attribute this unique behaviour to surface-localized states in the bandgap that turn HgTe QDs into 4-level systems. The resulting long-lived population inversion induces amplified spontaneous emission under continuous-wave optical pumping at power levels compatible with solar irradiation and direct current electrical pumping. These results introduce an alternative approach for low-threshold QD-based gain media based on intentional trap states that paves the way for solution-processed infrared QD lasers and amplifiers."

Whereas there are various approaches that facilitate the identification of peptide-derived ligands, their evolution into higher affinity binders remains a major hurdle. We report a virtual screen based on molecular docking that allows the affinity maturation of macrocyclic peptides taking non-natural amino acids into consideration. These macrocycles bear large and flexible substituents which usually complicate the use of docking approaches. A virtual library containing more than 1400 structures was screened against the target focusing on docking poses with the core structure resembling a known bioactive conformation. Based on this screen, a macrocyclic peptide (22) involving two non-natural amino acids was evolved showing increased target affinity and biological activity. Predicted binding modes were verified by X-ray crystallography. The presented workflow allows the screening of large macrocyclic peptides with diverse modifications thereby expanding the accessible chemical space and reducing synthetic efforts."

  "description": "Comparison of landfarming amendments to improve bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in Niger Delta soilsLarge scale landfarming experiments, using an extensive range of treatments, were conducted in the Niger-Delta, Nigeria to study the degradation of oil in contaminated soils. In this work the effect of nutrient addition, biosurfactant, Eisenia fetida (earthworm) enzyme extract, bulking and sorption agents and soil neutralization were tested. It was found that these treatments were successful in removing up to 53% of the total petroleum hydrocarbon in the soil within 16 weeks. A comparison between treatments demonstrated that most were no more effective than agricultural fertilizer addition alone. One strategy that did show better performance was a combination of nutrients, biochar and biosurfactant, which was found to remove 23% more Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) than fertilizer alone. However, when performance normalized costs were considered, this treatment became less attractive as a remedial option. Based on this same analysis it was concluded that fertilizer only was the most cost effective treatment. As a consequence, it is recommended that fertilizer is used to enhance the landfarming of hydrocarbon contaminated soils in the Niger Delta. The attenuation rates of both bulk TPH and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon Criteria Working Group (TPHCWG) fractions are also provided. These values represent one of the first large scale and scientifically tested datasets for treatment of contaminated soil in the Niger Delta region. An inverse correlation between attenuation rates and hydrocarbon molecular weight was observed with heavy fractions showing much slower degradation rates than lighter fractions. Despite this difference, the bioremediation process resulted in significant removal of all TPH compounds independent of carbon number."

  "description": "Optimization of an in vitro assay methodology for competitive binding of thyroidogenic xenobiotics with thyroxine on human transthyretin and albuminThyroid hormones (THs) are involved in the regulation of many physiological processes in vertebrates. Competition for TH binding sites on serum transport proteins can interfere with delivery of THs to target tissues, and this is a potential mechanism of action of exogenous thyroidogenic substances. To date, detailed accounts of in vitro methods for competitive binding with THs on TH transport proteins (human or wildlife) are sparse. In the limited number of published studies on in vitro radio-labelled TH-TH transport protein interactions, method descriptions were brief and with insufficient details for successful replication. Furthermore, upon review of these methodologies, we identified several opportunities for optimization. The present study addresses the methodological deficiencies and describes, in detail, a fully optimized and validated competitive T4 radio-ligand binding assay with human transthyretin (TTR) and albumin (ALB). \u2022 Significant improvements were made over previous methods, including better maintenance of protein stability and enhanced measurement of competition between different ligands.\u2022 Sample size was reduced to allow use of small pre-packed size exclusion chromatography columns, which eliminates the rinsing step during the separation procedure.\u2022 The assay was parameterized for use with T4 and human TTR and ALB."

A mislabeling of the units was found in Figure 2D. The y-axes of both graphs should read: \"concentration of gold (ng gold/L)\" not \"(ng gold/mL)\". Similarly, in Supplementary Figure S4 the urine concentration on the yaxis should also read: \"concentration of gold (ng gold/L)\". This error affects the estimate of % mass translocation in the Discussion, which also contained inconsistencies. We have now corrected these errors and refined our exposure estimates for this calculation. Thus, we would like to revise the following text on page 4546: \"Based on the exposure characteristics of our first study (2 h exposure of \u223c116 \u03bcg/m3 under light exercise), we calculate the total inhaled dose of particulate to be \u223c690 mg. If \u223c80 \u03bcg of gold was cleared by the kidneys over 24 h (average volume of urine collected: 2.4 L containing 35 ng/mL), and, therefore, if this was the sole route of clearance, we estimate that at least 0.2% of inhaled gold nanoparticles translocated from the lung into circulation\". This should be replaced with: \"Based on the exposure characteristics of our first study (2 h exposure of \u223c116 \u03bcg/m3 intermittent rest [6 L/min for 4 \u00d7 15 min] and moderate exercise [47.5 L/min for 4 \u00d7 15 min]), we calculate the total inhaled dose of the particulate to be \u223c383 \u03bcg. If \u223c84 ng of gold was cleared by the kidney over 24 h (average volume or urine collected: 2.4 L containing 35 ng/L; Figure 1D), we estimate that at least 0.02% of inhaled gold nanoparticles translocated from the lung into the circulation\". We emphasize that this calculation is for illustrative purposes and represents only a defined 24 h period in time. The estimate is likely to be conservative and does not take into account the proportion of alveolar deposition and the slow return of respiratory rate to resting levels after exercise and is based on the assumption that the urine is the sole route of clearance. While this estimate is an order of magnitude lower than that stated in the original manuscript, the proportion of translocated particles still fits with prior findings. Early studies in rodents provided rough estimates that <1% mass of nanoparticles with a diameter of <50 nm will translocate.1 Subsequent studies broadened this range from 0.01 to 10%, although estimates are most frequently around 0.3% or less for a given tissue at 24 h post-exposure.2-11 Studies in man are hampered by technical limitations,12,13 although, on the assumption that translocation can occur in man, current findings suggest a very low rate of translocation.14-16 Thus, the estimate of 0.02% translocation in the present study concurs with that of previous work. Differences in the species, method of exposure, particle size, particle physicochemistry, post-exposure sampling period, method of measurement and tissue sample(s) used, all make direct comparisons between these studies challenging. In most instances (especially where values are close to the threshold of detection), the relative amount of gold in exposed versus nonexposed tissues (within the same study) has arguably greater value than the actual concentration of gold per se. However, the calculation has qualitative value in that it confirms or strengthens several key messages about the translocation process: (1) A very low proportion of nanoparticles translocate from the lung to the blood in both animals and man. (2) The body has several routes of clearance of translocated nanoparticles (including, but not limited to, the urine and via the liver) that will affect systemic levels of nanoparticles. Nevertheless, translocated nanoparticles accumulate in several tissues. The individual biokinetics of these routes requires further research. (3) Particles are retained in the lung for long periods of time, thus, there appears to be an ongoing slow translocation of low amounts of nanoparticles into the blood (from the lung and/or other organs they may have originally accumulated in). These corrections do not affect any other findings of the paper or the conclusions drawn. The important observation in the current study is that translocated nanoparticles reach and accumulate at areas of disease that may be most susceptible to their physicochemical properties. Thus, the preferential accumulation in regions of susceptibility suggests that translocated nanoparticles could cause significant biological actions that promote the disease process."

  "description": "Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals perturbs lipid metabolism and circadian rhythmsA growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to environmental chemicals can contribute to the etiology of obesity by inappropriately stimulating adipogenesis as well as perturbing lipid metabolism and energy balance. One potential mechanism by which chemical exposure can influence lipid metabolism is through disturbance of circadian rhythms, endogenously-driven cycles of roughly 24hr in length that coordinate biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes in all organisms. Here we show for the first time that exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including the pesticide tributyltin, two commercial flame retardants, and a UV-filter chemical found in sunscreens, can perturb both circadian clocks and lipid metabolism in vertebrates. Exposure of developing zebrafish to EDCs affects core clock activity and leads to a remarkable increase in lipid accumulation that is reminiscent of the effects observed for longdaysin, a known disruptor of circadian rhythms. Our data reveal a novel obesogenic mechanism of action for environmental chemicals, an observation which warrants further research. Because circadian clocks regulate a wide variety of physiological processes, identification of environmental chemicals capable of perturbing these systems may provide important insights into the development of environmentally-induced metabolic disease"

  "description": "11-Oxygenated androgen precursors are the preferred substrates for aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3): Implications for castration resistant prostate cancerThe progression of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is driven by the intratumoral conversion of adrenal androgen precursors to potent androgens. The expression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3), which catalyses the reduction of weak androgens to more potent androgens, is significantly increased in CRPC tumours. The oxidation of androgens to their inactive form is catalysed by 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17\u03b2HSD2), but little attention is given to the expression levels of this enzyme. In this study, we show that the 11-oxygenated androgen precursors of adrenal origin are the preferred substrate for AKR1C3. In particular we show that the enzymatic efficiency of AKR1C3 is 8- and 24-fold greater for 11-ketoandrostenedione than for the classic substrates androstenedione and 5\u03b1-androstanedione, respectively. Using three independent experimental systems and a computational model we subsequently show that increased ratios of AKR1C3:17\u03b2HSD2 significantly favours the flux through the 11-oxygenated androgen pathway as compared to the classical or 5\u03b1-androstanedione pathways. Our findings reveal that the flux through the classical and 5\u03b1-androstanedione pathways are limited by the low catalytic efficiently of AKR1C3 towards classical androgens combined with the high catalytic efficiency of 17\u03b2HSD2, and that the expression of the oxidative enzyme therefore plays a vital role in determining the steady state concentration of active androgens. Using microarray data from prostate tissue we confirm that the AKR1C3:17\u03b2HSD2 ratio is significantly increased in patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy as compared to benign tissue, and further increased in patients with CRPC. Taken together this study therefore demonstrates that the ratio of AKR1C3:17\u03b2HSD2 is more important than AKR1C3 expression alone in determining intratumoral androgen levels and that 11-oxygenated androgens may play a bigger role in CRPC than previously anticipated."

  "description": "Acetaminophen reduces the protein levels of high affinity amino acid permeases and causes tryptophan depletionIn yeast, toxicity of acetaminophen (APAP), a frequently used analgesic and antipyretic drug, depends on ubiquitin-controlled processes. Previously, we showed a remarkable overlap in toxicity profiles between APAP and tyrosine, and a similarity with drugs like rapamycin and quinine, which induce degradation of the amino acid permease Tat2. Therefore, we investigated in yeast whether APAP reduced the expression levels of amino acid permeases. The protein levels of Tat2, Tat1, Mup1 and Hip1 were reduced, while the expression of the general permease Gap1 was increased, consistent with a nutrient starvation response. Overexpression of Tat1 and Tat2, but not Mup1, Hip1 and Gap1 conferred resistance to APAP. A tryptophan auxotrophic strain trp1\u0394 was more sensitive to APAP than wild-type and addition of tryptophan completely restored the growth restriction of trp1\u2206 upon APAP exposure, while tyrosine had an additive effect on APAP toxicity. Furthermore, intracellular aromatic amino acid concentrations were reduced upon APAP exposure. This effect was less prominent in ubiquitin-deficient yeast strains that were APAP resistant and showed a reduced degradation of high affinity amino acid permeases. APAP-induced changes in intracellular amino acid concentrations were also detected in hepatoma HepG2 cells indicating significance for humans."

  "description": "Do microplastics affect marine ecosystem productivity?Marine and coastal ecosystems are among the largest contributors to the Earth's productivity. Experimental studies have shown negative impacts of microplastics on individual algae or zooplankton organisms. Consequently, primary and secondary productivity may be negatively affected as well. In this study we attempted to estimate the impacts on productivity at ecosystem level based on reported laboratory findings with a modelling approach, using our biogeochemical model for the North Sea (Delft3D-GEM). Although the model predicted that microplastics do not affect the total primary or secondary production of the North Sea as a whole, the spatial patterns of secondary production were altered, showing local changes of \u00b110%. However, relevant field data on microplastics are scarce, and strong assumptions were required to include the plastic concentrations and their impacts under field conditions into the model. These assumptions reveal the main knowledge gaps that have to be resolved to improve the first estimate above."

  "description": "Influence of lactococcal surface properties on cell retention and distribution in cheese curdDuring cheese manufacturing, on average 90% of the starter culture cells are believed to be entrapped in the curd, with the remainder lost in whey. This paper shows that plasmid-cured dairy strains of Lactococcus lactis show cell retention in the curd of 30\u201372%, whereas over-expression of pili on the lactococcal cell surface can increase cell retention to 99%. Exopolysaccharide production and cell clumping and chaining do not influence cell retention in cheese curd. L. lactis surface alteration also strongly affected the distribution of cells in the cheese matrix: clumping and over-expression of pili led to formation of large cell aggregates embedded in the protein matrix whereas exopolysaccharide expression resulted in cells being surrounding by small serum regions in the protein matrix of the cheese. These results suggest that surface properties of dairy starter cultures strongly determine retention and distribution of the bacteria in cheese curd."

  "description": "Import, disposal, and health impacts of pesticides in the East Africa Rift(EAR) zone: A review on management and policy analysisEast Africa Rift (EAR) zone countries, such as Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda are among the least developed countries in the world. Agricultural activities are the main source of their economy and huge amounts of pesticides have been imported for decades to protect crops from damage by pests and diseases. Some of these pesticides expired in storage before they were used and their disposal became a major problem. Further, these countries declare different policies related to pesticide management. This study reviews the relevant literature about import, disposal and health impacts of pesticides together with different related policies. Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Google were used as the main sources of information. Records show the increases in the import of pesticides in Ethiopia from 2013 to 2016, in Tanzania from 2006 to 2011, in Kenya from 2008 to 2015, and in Uganda from 1980 to 2004. Disposing of obsolete pesticides is very costly and needs proper facilities. Therefore, EAR countries transport these pesticides to European countries for incineration. For example, Ethiopia disposed of 1574.5 and 926 tonnes of obsolete pesticides in collaboration with the FAO. Acute and passive pesticide poisoning occurrences are also discussed in the review. The paper also highlights the policies so far stated. However, these policies lack proper implementation. Therefore, this study suggests EAR countries should use alternative methods to protect crops from the damage caused by pests and diseases, which could reduce the excessive import of pesticides. Similarly, training should also be given to all stakeholders to ensure implementation of all policies."

  "description": "Servant leadership and innovative work behavior in Chinese high-tech firms: A moderated mediation model of meaningful work and job autonomyScholars acknowledge the critical role of employee innovative work behavior (IWB) in facilitating organizational innovation in high-tech industries. However, the current knowledge is far from complete to paint a clear picture of how to evoke employee IWB in the Chinese high-tech industry. Many Chinese high-tech firms face a challenge moving from hierarchy-based leadership toward more employee-centered leadership styles, as the styles have different effects on employees' IWB. This perspective may complement and sharpen the incomplete picture. Drawing on a dynamic componential model of creativity and innovation, this study proposes and tests a moderated mediation model that examines the hypothesized positive influence of servant leadership on employee IWB via meaningful work as well as the moderating role of job autonomy in this process. We collected data (N = 288) from three Chinese high-tech firms and found that employees' perceptions of meaningful work mediate the relationship between servant leaders and IWB. We also found that this mediating relationship is conditional on the moderating role of job autonomy in the path from servant leadership to meaningful work. The results further show that the indirect effect of servant leadership on employee IWB via meaningful work exists only when job autonomy is high."

  "description": "Subsurface landfill leachate contamination affects microbial metabolic potential and gene expression in the Banisveld aquiferMicrobial communities in groundwater ecosystems can develop the capacity to degrade complex mixtures of chemicals resulting from pollution by landfill leachate. Monitoring this natural attenuation requires insight into the metabolic potential and activity of microbial communities. We contrasted the metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from a leachate-polluted aquifer downstream of the Banisveld (the Netherlands) landfill with uncontaminated groundwater, which revealed changes in microbial genomic content and activity. Banisveld landfill leachate contains mono-aromatic hydrocarbons and the assessment of natural attenuation of these compounds in the aquifer had been a focal point of research. In the contaminated groundwater, active microbial functions were the ones involved in degradation of complex carbon substrates and organic pollutants. We found that benzylsuccinate synthase genes-involved in the catabolism of toluene-were highly expressed close to the source of contamination, confirming the ongoing natural attenuation of organic mono-aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in this aquifer. Additionally, metatranscriptomes were indicative of phosphorus limitation that can constrain total microbial activity and agree with the low phosphate concentrations ( < 0.4 \u03bcmol/L) in this aquifer. Through the application of metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, we were able to determine functional potential and expression patterns to assess the natural attenuation processes and constraints on microbial communities."

Neurons in the human brain communicate via well over a quadrillion synapses. Their specific contribution might be key to the dynamic activity patterns that underlie primate-specific cognitive function. Recently, functional differences were described in transmission capabilities of human and rat synapses. To test whether unique expression signatures of synaptic proteins are at the basis of this, we performed a quantitative analysis of the hippocampal synaptic proteome of four mammalian species, two primates, human and marmoset, and two rodents, rat and mouse. Abundance differences down to 1.15-fold at an FDR-corrected p-value of 0.005 were reliably detected using SWATH mass spectrometry. The high measurement accuracy of SWATH allowed the detection of a large group of differentially expressed proteins between individual species and rodent vs. primate. Differentially expressed proteins between rodent and primate were found highly enriched for plasticity-related proteins."

Investigating the dynamics of the interactions between stress responsive transcription factors from toxicogenomic data and defining the signature of each of them is an additional step toward a system level understanding of perturbation driven mechanisms. To this end, we investigated the segregation of the genes belonging to the three following transcriptionally regulated pathways: the AhR pathway, the Nrf2 pathway and the ATF4 pathway. Toxicogenomic datasets from three projects (carcinoGENOMICS, Predict-IV and TG-GATEs) obtained in various experimental conditions (in human and rat in vitro liver and kidney models and rat in vivo, with bolus administration and with repeated doses) were combined and consolidated where overlaps between datasets existed. A bioinformatic analysis was performed to refine pathways' signatures and to create chemical activation capacity scores to classify chemicals by their potency and selectivity of activation of each pathway. With some refinement such an approach may improve chemical safety classification and allow biological read across on a pathway level."

  "description": "Unraveling the Origin of Solvent Induced Enantioselectivity in the Henry Reaction with Cinchona Thiourea as CatalystIn this work, we report an energy decomposition and electronic structure analysis using DFT calculations for the C-C coupling step in the Henry reaction with cinchona thiourea as catalyst and DMF solvent to unravel the origin of enantioselectivity. We found that the conformation of flexible thiourea moiety is affected by the solvent, and in the preferred conformation of thiourea in strong Lewis basic DMF solvent, the N-H sites are in the opposite direction, i.e., in trans conformation. Hence, the thiourea moiety acts via single hydrogen bonding with substrates. The conformation of the substrates with respect to the forming C-C bond plays critical role to increase orbital interaction between two substrates and enhances hydrogen bond strength between substrates and catalyst, which in turn stabilizes the positive charge developing on the catalyst at the transition state for one of the enantiomers (S). Thus, the enantioselectivity has electronic structure origin. The stronger H-bond formation in the S enantiomer has been confirmed by the calculated IR spectra and is in agreement with thus far experimental and computational results."

In such cases the topological Levi-Desargues graph for all the Berry pseudorotations (BPR, max. 20) reduces to interconnected inner and outer \"circles\" that represent the dynamic enantiomer pair. High enough barriers of the BPR crossovers between the two circles is all what is needed to ascertain chiral integrity. This is illustrated computationally and experimentally for the organosilicates 7 and 10 that carry besides a Me (a), Et (b), Ph (c), or F (d) group two bidentate 2-(phenyl)benzo[b]-thiophene or 2-(phenyl)naphthyl ligands, respectively. The enantiomers of tetraorganosilane precursor 9 could be separated by column chromatography. Their chiral integrity persisted on forming the silicates. CD spectra are reported for 10c.

  "description": "Colloidal CdSe Nanoplatelets, A Model for Surface Chemistry/Optoelectronic Property Relations in Semiconductor NanocrystalsWhile the surface termination of quasi-spherical metal chalcogenide nanocrystals or quantum dots has been widely investigated, it remains unclear whether the ensuing surface chemistry models apply to similar nanocrystals with anisotropic shapes. In this work, we report on the surface-chemistry of 2D CdSe nanoplatelets, where we make use of an improved synthesis strategy that yields stable and aggregation free nanoplatelet suspensions with a photoluminescence quantum yield as high as 55%. We confirm that such nanoplatelets are enriched in Cd and, by means of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that the Cd-rich surface is terminated by X-type carboxylate ligands. Not unlike CdSe quantum dots (QDs), entire cadmium carboxylate entities can be displaced by the addition of amines, and the desorption isotherm points toward a considerable binding site heterogeneity. Moreover, we find that even the slightest displacement of cadmium carboxylate ligands quenches the nanoplatelet photoluminescence. These experimental findings are further confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on a 5 monolayer model CdSe nanoplatelet. These simulations show that the most labile ligands are located in the vicinity of facet edges, and that the displacement of ligands from such edge sites creates midgap states that can account for the observed photoluminescence quenching. Next to extending surface chemistry insights from colloidal QDs to nanoplatelets, this work indicates that CdSe nanoplatelets constitute a unique nanocrystal model system to establish a comprehensive description of midgap trap states, which includes their structural, chemical, and electronic properties."

  "description": "Advances in Palladium-Catalyzed Cascade CyclizationsThe past decades in organic chemistry have witnessed significant improvements in synthetic efficiency as a result of considerable progress in cascade reactions, tandem reactions, and related one-pot processes. These methods are less time-consuming and produce less waste compared to the classical stepwise approach. However, cascade chemistry requires a more careful design and compatible reaction types for success. Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, with their well understood multistep catalytic cycles, form a promising basis for the design of cascade reactions. Furthermore, they are compatible with a range of functional groups and can be combined with a range of secondary transformations. The resulting palladium-catalyzed cascade reactions have provided access to a plethora of complex small molecules of high medicinal relevance. This review provides an overview of the developments in palladium-catalyzed cascade reactions since 2011, classified according to the initiation, propagation, and termination steps comprising the palladium cascade reactions. This classification should assist the reader and may provide inspiration for the design of new cascade reactions. (Figure presented.)."

  "description": "Finding and Fixing Traps in II-VI and III-V Colloidal Quantum Dots: The Importance of Z-Type Ligand PassivationEnergy levels in the band gap arising from surface states can dominate the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs). Recent theoretical work has predicted that such trap states in II-VI and III-V QDs arise only from two-coordinated anions on the QD surface, offering the hypothesis that Lewis acid (Z-type) ligands should be able to completely passivate these anionic trap states. In this work, we provide experimental support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that Z-type ligation is the primary cause of PL QY increase when passivating undercoordinated CdTe QDs with various metal salts. Optimized treatments with InCl3 or CdCl2 afford a near-unity (>90%) photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY), whereas other metal halogen or carboxylate salts provide a smaller increase in PL QY as a result of weaker binding or steric repulsion. The addition of non-Lewis acidic ligands (amines, alkylammonium chlorides) systematically gives a much smaller but non-negligible increase in the PL QY. We discuss possible reasons for this result, which points toward a more complex and dynamic QD surface. Finally we show that Z-type metal halide ligand treatments also lead to a strong increase in the PL QY of CdSe, CdS, and InP QDs and can increase the efficiency of sintered CdTe solar cells. These results show that surface anions are the dominant source of trap states in II-VI and III-V QDs and that passivation with Lewis acidic Z-type ligands is a general strategy to fix those traps. Our work also provides a method to tune the PL QY of QD samples from nearly zero up to near-unity values, without the need to grow epitaxial shells."

In this paper, we share our study and review similar published work, emphasising fish health monitoring in European Seas and illustrating it using case studies. Arguably, an integrative approach is needed to assess the impact on population of chemical contaminants, beginning with field observations and complemented with experimental (laboratory and mesocosm) studies and modelling. Field surveys and monitoring using fish biomarkers should be intensified and ideally integrated with population statistics and fish ecology knowledge. Moreover, the indirect effects of chemicals \u2013 altering ecosystem functions \u2013 and the monitoring of immunological biomarkers and fatal diseases in wild fish populations should receive more attention."

  "description": "GH3 and RC-4BC cell lines are not suitable as in vitro models to study prolactin modulation and AHR responsiveness in rat pituitarySome environmental contaminants and pharmaceuticals increase the incidence of uterine tumors in toxicological studies with rats. These tumors can result from a hormonal imbalance due to rat-specific disrupted pituitary prolactin regulation, and are therefore of questionable relevance for humans. In this study we compared in vitro prolactin regulation in rat primary pituitary cells to that in pituitary cell lines, GH3 and RC-4BC. Moreover, we assessed the potential effects of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation on prolactin regulation by using two different AHR agonists, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and DELAQ, the N-deethylated minor metabolite of the pharmaceutical laquinimod. In rat primary pituitary cells, known prolactin stimulant thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) marginally increased prolactin secretion (1.2-fold) and gene expression (1.3-fold). In contrast, synthetic dopamine receptor agonist quinpirole, a known inhibitor of prolactin release, significantly inhibited prolactin secretion (2.6-fold) and gene expression (3.6-fold). In GH3 cells, TRH strongly increased prolactin secretion (6.8-fold) and gene expression (30.8-fold), whereas quinpirole did not affect prolactin secretion nor gene expression. In RC-4BC cells, both TRH and quinpirole did not modulate prolactin secretion nor gene expression. Prolactin secretion and gene expression did not significantly change upon exposure to TCDD or DELAQ. However, DELAQ, but not TCDD, attenuated quinpirole-inhibited prolactin gene expression by 51% in primary pituitary cells. This study shows that pituitary prolactin regulation in rat primary pituitary cells in vitro is distinctly different from rat pituitary cell lines GH3 and RC-4BC. Therefore, effects on pituitary prolactin regulation in vitro should best be performed using rat primary pituitary cells. Additionally, AHR ligands may interact with rat pituitary prolactin regulation, but this appears to depend on the ligand and constitutive prolactin secretion. However, interpretation of the in vitro results with respect to occurrence of uterine tumors in rats should take the complex regulation of prolactin release in the pituitary into account as well as the in vivo hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and its feedback loops."

  "description": "Circular Spectropolarimetric Sensing of Vegetation in the Field: Possibilities for the Remote Detection of Extraterrestrial LifeHomochirality is a generic and unique property of all biochemical life, and the fractional circular polarization of light it induces therefore constitutes a potentially unambiguous biosignature. However, while high-quality circular polarimetric spectra can be easily and quickly obtained in the laboratory, accurate measurements in the field are much more challenging due to large changes in illumination and target movement. In this study, we measured various targets in the field, up to distances of a few kilometers, using the dedicated circular spectropolarimeter TreePol. We show how photosynthetic life can readily be distinguished from abiotic matter. We underline the potential of circular polarization signals as a remotely accessible means to characterize and monitor terrestrial vegetation, for example, for agriculture and forestry. In addition, we discuss the potential of circular polarization for the remote detection of extraterrestrial life."

Compared to more traditional syntheses of CsPbBr3 NCs, the present scheme delivers NCs with the following distinctive features: (i) The NCs do not have cubic but truncated octahedron shape enclosed by Pb-terminated facets. This is a consequence of the strong binding affinity of the phosphonate groups toward Pb2+ ions. (II) The NCs have near unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), with no need of postsynthesis treatments, indicating that alkyl phosphonic acids are effectively preventing the formation of surface traps. (III) Unlike NCs coated with alkylammonium or carboxylate ligands, the PLQY of phosphonate coated NCs remains constant upon dilution, suggesting that the ligands are tightly bound to the surface."

  "description": "A Multiomics Study To Unravel the Effects of Developmental Exposure to Endosulfan in Rats: Molecular Explanation for Sex-Dependent EffectsExposure to low levels of environmental contaminants, including pesticides, induces neurodevelopmental toxicity. Environmental and food contaminants can reach the brain of the fetus, affecting brain development and leading to neurological dysfunction. The pesticide endosulfan is a persistent pollutant, and significant levels still remain detectable in the environment although its use is banned in some countries. In rats, endosulfan exposure during brain development alters motor activity, coordination, learning, and memory, even several months after uptake, and does so in a sex-dependent way. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these effects have not been studied in detail. In this work, we performed a multiomics study in cerebellum from rats exposed to endosulfan during embryonic development. Pregnant rats were orally exposed to a low dose (0.5 mg/kg) of endosulfan, daily, from gestational day 7 to postnatal day 21. The progeny was evaluated for cognitive and motor functions at adulthood. Expression of messenger RNA and microRNA genes, as well as protein and metabolite levels, were measured on cerebellar samples from males and females. An integrative analysis was conducted to identify altered processes under endosulfan effect. Effects between males and females were compared. Pathways significantly altered by endosulfan exposure included the phosphatidylinositol signaling system, calcium signaling, the cGMP-PKG pathway, the inflammatory and immune system, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and GABA and taurine metabolism. Sex-dependent effects of endosulfan in the omics results that matched sex differences in cognitive and motor tests were found. These results shed light on the molecular basis of impaired neurodevelopment and contribute to the identification of new biomarkers of neurotoxicity."

Here, we make initial steps towards the potential design of such a remotesensing system by: (1) identifying the properties of marine plastic debris amenable to remote sensingmethods and (2) highlighting the oceanic processes relevant to scientific questions about marineplastic debris. Remote sensing approaches are reviewed and matched to the optical properties ofmarine plastic debris and the relevant spatio-temporal scales of observation to identify challengesand opportunities in the field. Finally, steps needed to develop marine plastic debris detection byremote sensing platforms are proposed in terms of fundamental science as well as linkages to ongoingplanning for satellite systems with similar observation requirements."

These variations allowed for the investigation of the factors involved in the activation of dihydroboranes in the synthesis of terminal borylene complexes.

A series of photoswitchable azobenzene ligands was prepared through various synthetic strategies and multistep syntheses. Photochemical and pharmacological properties were used to guide the design iterations. Investigations of positional and substituent effects reveal that halogen substituents on the ortho-position of the outer ring are preferred for conferring partial agonism on the cis form of the ligands. This effect could be expanded by an electron-donating group on the para-position of the central ring. A variety of efficacy differences between the trans and cis forms emerges from these compounds. Tool compounds VUF15888 (4d) and VUF16620 (6e) represent more subtle efficacy switches, while VUF16216 (6f) displays the largest efficacy switch, from antagonism to full agonism. The compound class disclosed here can aid in new photopharmacology studies of CXCR3 signaling."

We compare the trends in XHn AMCAs with the trends in XHn proton affinities (PAs). We also examine the differences between the trends in AMCAs of the neutral XHn bases with those in the corresponding anionic XHn-1 - bases.

  "description": "Gpr158 Deficiency Impacts Hippocampal CA1 Neuronal Excitability, Dendritic Architecture, and Affects Spatial LearningG-protein-coupled receptor 158 (Gpr158) is highly expressed in striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. It gained attention as it was implicated in physiological responses to stress and depression. Recently, Gpr158 has been shown to act as a pathway-specific synaptic organizer in the hippocampus, required for proper mossy fiber-CA3 neurocircuitry establishment, structure, and function. Although rodent Gpr158 expression is highest in CA3, considerable expression occurs in CA1 especially after the first postnatal month. Here, we combined hippocampal-dependent behavioral paradigms with subsequent electrophysiological and morphological analyses from the same group of mice to assess the effects of Gpr158 deficiency on CA1 physiology and function. We demonstrate deficits in spatial memory acquisition and retrieval in the Morris water maze paradigm, along with deficits in the acquisition of extinction memory in the passive avoidance test in Gpr158 KO mice. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons revealed normal basal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, however, Schaffer collateral stimulation yielded dramatically reduced post-synaptic currents. Interestingly, intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidals was found increased, potentially acting as a compensatory mechanism to the reductions in Schaffer collateral-mediated drive. Both ex vivo and in vitro, neurons deficient for or with lowered levels of Gpr158 exhibited robust reductions in dendritic architecture and complexity, i.e., reduced length, surface, bifurcations, and branching. This effect was localized in the apical but not basal dendrites of adult CA1 pyramidals, indicative of compartment-specific alterations. A significant positive correlation between spatial memory acquisition and extent of complexity of CA1 pyramidals was found. Taken together, we provide first evidence of significant disruptions in hippocampal CA1 neuronal dendritic architecture and physiology, driven by Gpr158 deficiency. Importantly, the hippocampal neuronal morphology deficits appear to support the impairments in spatial memory acquisition observed in Gpr158 KO mice."

  "description": "Type VII Secretion Substrates of Pathogenic Mycobacteria Are Processed by a Surface ProteaseTuberculosis, one of the world\u2019s most severe infectious diseases, is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A major weapon of this pathogen is a unique cell wall that protects the pathogen from eradication by the immune system. Mycobacteria have specialized secretion systems, e.g., type VII secretion or ESX systems, to transport substrates across this cell wall. The largest group of proteins that are secreted by these ESX systems are the PE proteins. Previously, it was shown that the N-terminal PE domain of about 100 amino acids is required for secretion. Here, we describe the identification of an aspartic protease, designated PecA, that removes (part of) this PE domain at the cell surface. Nearly all of the observed PE_PGRS proteins are processed by PecA. Interestingly, the protease itself is also a secreted PE protein and subject to self-cleavage. Furthermore, a defect in surface processing has no effect on the activity of the PE lipase protein LipY but does seem to affect the functioning of other virulence factors, as a pecA mutant strain of Mycobacterium marinum shows moderate attenuation in zebrafish larvae. In conclusion, our results reveal the presence of a functional aspartic acid protease in M. marinum that cleaves LipY, itself as well as other members of the PE_PGRS family. Finally, mutants lacking PecA show growth attenuation in vivo, suggesting that PecA plays a role during infection. IMPORTANCE Aspartic proteases are common in eukaryotes and retroviruses but are relatively rare among bacteria (N. D. Rawlings and A. Bateman, BMC Genomics 10:437, 2009, https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-10-437). In contrast to eukaryotic aspartic proteases, bacterial aspartic proteases are generally located in the cytoplasm. We have identified a surface-associated mycobacterial aspartic protease, PecA, which cleaves itself and many other type VII secretion substrates of the PE_PGRS family. PecA is present in most pathogenic mycobacterial species, including M. tuberculosis. In addition, pathogenicity of M. marinum is reduced in the \u0394pecA mutant, indicating that PecA contributes to virulence."

  "description": "Biodegradation of metformin and its transformation product, guanylurea, by natural and exposed microbial communitiesMetformin (MET) is a pharmaceutical product mostly biotransformed in the environment to a transformation product, guanylurea (GUA). In ready biodegradability tests (RBTs), however, contrasting results have been observed for metformin. The objective of this study was to measure the biodegradation of MET and GUA in RBTs, using activated sludge from the local wastewater treatment plant, either directly or after pre-exposure to MET, in a chemostat. The activated sludge community was cultivated in chemostats, in presence or absence of MET, for a period of nine months, and was used in RBT after one, three and nine months. The results of this study showed that the original activated sludge was able to completely remove MET (15 mg/l) and the newly produced GUA (50% of C0MET) under the test conditions. Inoculation of the chemostat led to a rapid shift in the community composition and abundance. The community exposed to 1.5 mg/l of MET was still able to completely consume MET in the RBTs after one-month exposure, but three- and nine-months exposure resulted in reduced removal of MET in the RBTs. The ability of the activated sludge community to degrade MET and GUA is the result of environmental exposure to these chemicals as well as of conditions that could not be reproduced in the laboratory system. A MET-degrading strain belonging to the genus Aminobacter has been isolated from the chemostat community. This strain was able to completely consume 15 mg/l of MET within three days in the test. However, community analysis revealed that the fluctuation in relative abundance of this genus (<1%) could not be correlated to the fluctuation in biodegradation capacity of the chemostat community."

  "description": "Reproducing benchmark potential energy curves of molecular bond dissociation with small complete active space aided with density and density-matrix functional correctionsVarious effects of electron correlation accompany molecular bond dissociation, which makes the efficient calculation of potential energy curves a notoriously difficult problem. In an attempt to reliably reproduce both absolute energies and shapes of the benchmark dissociation curves, calculations with the combined CAS\u03a0DFT method are carried out for the prototype molecules H2, BH, F2, and N2. The complete active space (CAS) part of CAS\u03a0DFT accounts for long-range nondynamic correlation, while short-range dynamic correlation is accounted for with the corrected Lee-Yang-Parr correlation functional of density functional theory (DFT). The correction represents the suppression of dynamic correlation with nondynamic correlation, and it is a function of the ratio x(r) between the conditional and conventional densities obtained with the CAS on-top pair density \u03a0(r). For the single-bonded molecules H2, BH, and F2, CAS\u03a0DFT succeeds in reproducing the shapes and absolute energies (for H2 and BH) of the benchmark curves, while for the triple-bonded N2 molecule, the addition to CAS\u03a0DFT of a multibond correction is required. It accounts for the middle-range dynamic correlation of the same-spin electrons in the (symmetrized) high-spin atomic electron configurations of the dissociating N2"

  "description": "A Novel Method for Long-Term Analysis of Lactic Acid and Ammonium Production in Non-growing Lactococcus lactis Reveals Pre-culture and Strain DependenceIn various (industrial) conditions, cells are in a non-growing but metabolically active state in which de novo protein synthesis capacity is limited. The production of a metabolite by such non-growing cells is dependent on the cellular condition and enzyme activities, such as the amount, stability, and degradation of the enzyme(s). For industrial fermentations in which the metabolites of interest are mainly formed after cells enter the stationary phase, the investigation of prolonged metabolite production is of great importance. However, current batch model systems do not allow prolonged measurements due to metabolite accumulation driving product-inhibition. Here we developed a protocol that allows high-throughput metabolic measurements to be followed in real-time over extended periods (weeks). As a validation model, sugar utilization and arginine consumption by a low density of translationally blocked Lactococcus lactis was designed in a defined medium. In this system L. lactis MG1363 was compared with its derivative HB60, a strain described to achieve higher metabolic yield through a shift toward heterofermentative metabolism. The results showed that in a non-growing state HB60 is able to utilize more arginine than MG1363, and for both strains the decay of the measured activities were dependent on pre-culture conditions. During the first 5 days of monitoring a \u223c25-fold decrease in acidification rate was found for strain HB60 as compared to a \u223c20-fold decrease for strain MG1363. Such measurements are relevant for the understanding of microbial metabolism and for optimizing applications in which cells are frequently exposed to long-term suboptimal conditions, such as microbial cell factories, fermentation ripening, and storage survival."

  "description": "Learning strategies in sustainable energy demonstration projects: What organizations learn from sustainable energy demonstrationsThis literature review study presents and discusses the learning strategies of organizations participating in sustainable energy demonstration projects. It finds that academic, commercial, and governmental organizations build on six major learning strategies. The first learning strategy is to capture intellectual property and benefit from knowledge spillovers. The second learning strategy comprises the building of a series of prototypes that are technically and commercially fit for purpose. The third learning strategy aims at operating production plants that produce the prototypes on a large scale. The fourth learning strategy concentrates on exploiting learning curves in these production plants. The fifth learning strategy focuses on creating supply-demand networks that serve increasing markets. Finally, the sixth learning strategy is to develop governmental regulation and funding schemes that support the emergence of an industrial and societal institutional infrastructure for sustainable energy technology, based on the lessons learned from the demonstration projects. This study also finds that the six learning strategies are facilitated by four key behaviors of participants in demonstration projects, which are mutual trust-building, decision-making in favor of sustainable energy technology, learning-network building, and demonstration program development. To academics, this study provides a comprehensive insight into organizations\u2019 learning strategies in sustainable energy demonstration projects, regarding learning directions and outcomes. Its contribution to practice is that it supports academic, commercial, and governmental organizations in managing their portfolio of learning strategies in new sustainable energy demonstration projects."

  "description": "Neutralising effects of small molecule toxin inhibitors on nanofractionated coagulopathic Crotalinae snake venomsRepurposing small molecule drugs and drug candidates is considered as a promising approach to revolutionise the treatment of snakebite envenoming. In this study, we investigated the inhibiting effects of the small molecules varespladib (nonspecific phospholipase A2 inhibitor), marimastat (broad spectrum matrix metalloprotease inhibitor) and dimercaprol (metal ion chelator) against coagulopathic toxins found in Crotalinae (pit vipers) snake venoms. Venoms from Bothrops asper, Bothrops jararaca, Calloselasma rhodostoma and Deinagkistrodon acutus were separated by liquid chromatography, followed by nanofractionation and mass spectrometry identification undertaken in parallel. Nanofractions of the venom toxins were then subjected to a high-throughput coagulation assay in the presence of different concentrations of the small molecules under study. Anticoagulant venom toxins were mostly identified as phospholipases A2, while procoagulant venom activities were mainly associated with snake venom metalloproteinases and snake venom serine proteases. Varespladib was found to effectively inhibit most anticoagulant venom effects, and also showed some inhibition against procoagulant toxins. Contrastingly, marimastat and dimercaprol were both effective inhibitors of procoagulant venom activities but showed little inhibitory capability against anticoagulant toxins. The information obtained from this study aids our understanding of the mechanisms of action of toxin inhibitor drug candidates, and highlights their potential as future snakebite treatments."

  "description": "Widespread evolution of molecular resistance to snake venom \u03b1-neurotoxins in vertebratesVenomous snakes are important subjects of study in evolution, ecology, and biomedicine. Many venomous snakes have alpha-neurotoxins (\u03b1-neurotoxins) in their venom. These toxins bind the alpha-1 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction, causing paralysis and asphyxia. Several venomous snakes and their predators have evolved resistance to \u03b1-neurotoxins. The resistance is conferred by steric hindrance from N-glycosylated asparagines at amino acids 187 or 189, by an arginine at position 187 that has been hypothesized to either electrostatically repulse positively charged neurotoxins or sterically interfere with \u03b1-neurotoxin binding, or proline replacements at positions 194 or 197 of the nAChR ligand-binding domain to inhibit \u03b1-neurotoxin binding through structural changes in the receptor. Here, we analyzed this domain in 148 vertebrate species, and assessed its amino acid sequences for resistance-associated mutations. Of these sequences, 89 were sequenced de novo. We find widespread convergent evolution of the N-glycosylation form of resistance in several taxa including venomous snakes and their lizard prey, but not in the snake-eating birds studied. We also document new lineages with the arginine form of inhibition. Using an in vivo assay in four species, we provide further evidence that N-glycosylation mutations reduce the toxicity of cobra venom. The nAChR is of crucial importance for normal neuromuscular function and is highly conserved throughout the vertebrates as a result. Our research shows that the evolution of \u03b1-neurotoxins in snakes may well have prompted arms races and mutations to this ancient receptor across a wide range of sympatric vertebrates. These findings underscore the inter-connectedness of the biosphere and the ripple effects that one adaption can have across global ecosystems."

  "description": "Zebrafish embryo model for assessment of drug efficacy on mycobacterial persistersTuberculosis continues to kill millions of people each year. The main difficulty in eradication of the disease is the prolonged duration of treatment, which takes at least 6 months. Persister cells have long been associated with failed treatment and disease relapse because of their phenotypical, though transient, tolerance to drugs. By targeting these persisters, the duration of treatment could be shortened, leading to improved tuberculosis treatment and a reduction in transmission. The unique in vivo environment drives the generation of persisters; however, appropriate in vivo mycobacterial persister models enabling optimized drug screening are lacking. To set up a persister infection model that is suitable for this, we infected zebrafish embryos with in vitro-starved Mycobacterium marinum. In vitro starvation resulted in a persister-like phenotype with the accumulation of stored neutral lipids and concomitant increased tolerance to ethambutol. However, these starved wild-type M. marinum organisms rapidly lost their persister phenotype in vivo. To prolong the persister phenotype in vivo, we subsequently generated and analyzed mutants lacking functional resuscitation-promoting factors (Rpfs). Interestingly, the \u0394rpfAB mutant, lacking two Rpfs, established an infection in vivo, whereas a nutrient-starved \u0394rpfAB mutant did maintain its persister phenotype in vivo. This mutant was, after nutrient starvation, also tolerant to ethambutol treatment in vivo, as would be expected for persisters. We propose that this zebrafish embryo model with \u0394rpfAB mutant bacteria is a valuable addition for drug screening purposes and specifically screens to target mycobacterial persisters."

  "description": "Scientific Perspectivism in Secondary-School Chemistry Education: Integrating Concepts and Skills in Chemical ThinkingThe importance of learning chemical ways of thinking is widely recognized. Various frameworks have been developed to address the essence of chemistry and chemical thinking. However, very few studies have focused on how chemical ways of thinking can be defined. To elaborate chemical ways of thinking, this paper draws on scientific perspectivism (Giere 2010; Wimsatt 2007; Thagard 2012). Scientific perspectivism states that, within each general domain, several broadly accepted theoretical models exist side by side. These general theoretical models, or theoretical perspectives, determine which research questions are generated, which types of models are developed, and which criteria are important for evaluating models. A theoretical perspective can be captured in a core reasoning that embodies the fundamental relationship between model and the \u201creal world.\u201d Starting with their most basic form, perspectives can be used in learning how to reason about all types of ill-structured problems, directing and organizing knowledge development, and integrating knowledge and skills. The study is part of a research project on how perspectivism can be applied to the design of secondary-school chemistry education. This particular study concerns the identification, elaboration, and validation of four chemical perspectives for secondary-school chemistry education. We use these perspectives to indicate the consequences of taking a perspectivism approach to a curriculum framework. We conclude with discussing the consequences for secondary chemistry curriculum."

  "description": "Exploring metal availability in the natural niche of Streptococcus pneumoniae to discover potential vaccine antigensNasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a prerequisite for pneumococcal transmission and disease. Current vaccines protect only against disease and colonization caused by a limited number of serotypes, consequently allowing serotype replacement and transmission. Therefore, the development of a broadly protective vaccine against colonization, transmission and disease is desired but requires a better understanding of pneumococcal adaptation to its natural niche. Hence, we measured the levels of free and protein-bound transition metals in human nasal fluid, to determine the effect of metal concentrations on the growth and proteome of S. pneumoniae. Pneumococci cultured in medium containing metal levels comparable to nasal fluid showed a highly distinct proteomic profile compared to standard culture conditions, including the increased abundance of nine conserved, putative surface-exposed proteins. AliA, an oligopeptide binding protein, was identified as the strongest protective antigen, demonstrated by the significantly reduced bacterial load in a murine colonization and a lethal mouse pneumonia model, highlighting its potential as vaccine antigen."

  "description": "New approach methodologies (NAMs) for human-relevant biokinetics predictions: Meeting the paradigm shift in toxicology towards an animal-free chemical risk assessmentFor almost fifteen years, the availability and regulatory acceptance of new approach methodologies (NAMs) to assess the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME/biokinetics) in chemical risk evaluations are a bottleneck. To enhance the field, a team of 24 experts from science, industry, and regulatory bodies, including new generation toxicologists, met at the Lorentz Centre in Leiden, The Netherlands. A range of possibilities for the use of NAMs for biokinetics in risk evaluations were formulated (for example to define species differences and human variation or to perform quantitative in vitro-in vivo extrapolations). To increase the regulatory use and acceptance of NAMs for biokinetics for these ADME considerations within risk evaluations, the development of test guidelines (protocols) and of overarching guidance documents is considered a critical step. To this end, a need for an expert group on biokinetics within the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to supervise this process was formulated. The workshop discussions revealed that method development is still required, particularly to adequately capture transporter mediated processes as well as to obtain cell models that reflect the physiology and kinetic characteristics of relevant organs. Developments in the fields of stem cells, organoids and organ-on-a-chip models provide promising tools to meet these research needs in the future."

Herein, we correct an earlier study that intuitively attributed the mechanistic preferences of F- and PH2-, i.e., E2 and SN2, respectively, to a supposedly unfavorable shift in the polarity of the abstracted \u03b2-proton along the PH2-induced E2 pathway while claiming that \u2033...no correlation between the thermodynamic basicity and E2 rate should be expected.\u2033 Our analyses, however, unequivocally show that it is simply the 6 kcal mol-1 higher proton affinity of F- that enables this base to engage in a more stabilizing orbital interaction with CH3CH2Cl and hence to preferentially react via the E2 pathway, despite the higher characteristic distortivity (more destabilizing activation strain) associated with this pathway. On the other hand, the less basic PH2- has a weaker stabilizing interaction with CH3CH2Cl and is, therefore, unable to overcome the characteristic distortivity of the E2 pathway. Therefore, the mechanistic preference of PH2- is steered to the SN2 reaction channel (less-destabilizing activation strain). "

  "description": "The endosomal protein sorting nexin 4 is a synaptic proteinSorting nexin 4 (SNX4) is an evolutionary conserved protein that mediates recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane in yeast and mammalian cells. SNX4 is expressed in the brain. Altered protein levels are associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but the neuronal localization and function of SNX4 have not been addressed. Using a new antibody, endogenous neuronal SNX4 co-localized with both early and recycling endosome markers, similar to the reported localization of SNX4 in non-neuronal cells. Neuronal SNX4 accumulated specifically in synaptic areas, with a predominant localization to presynaptic terminals. Acute depletion of neuronal SNX4 using independent short hairpin RNAs did not affect the levels of the transferrin receptor, a canonical SNX4 cargo. Quantitative mass spectrometry revealed that upon SNX4 knockdown the class of proteins involved in neurotransmission was the most dysregulated. This included integral membrane proteins at both the presynaptic and postsynaptic side of the synapse that participate in diverse synaptic processes such as synapse assembly, neurotransmission and the synaptic vesicle cycle. These data suggest that SNX4 is implicated in a variety of synaptic processes."

  "description": "Population dynamics of microbial cross-feeding are determined by co-localization probabilities and cooperation-independent cheater growthAs natural selection acts on individual organisms the evolution of costly cooperation between microorganisms is an intriguing phenomenon. Introduction of spatial structure to privatize exchanged molecules can explain the evolution of cooperation. However, in many natural systems cells can also grow to low cell concentrations in the absence of these exchanged molecules, thus showing \u201ccooperation-independent background growth\u201d. We here serially propagated a synthetic cross-feeding consortium of lactococci in the droplets of a water-in-oil emulsion, essentially mimicking group selection with varying founder population sizes. The results show that when the growth of cheaters completely depends on cooperators, cooperators outcompete cheaters. However, cheaters outcompete cooperators when they can independently grow to only ten percent of the consortium carrying capacity. This result is the consequence of a probabilistic effect, as low founder population sizes in droplets decrease the frequency of cooperator co-localization. Cooperator-enrichment can be recovered by increasing the founder population size in droplets to intermediate values. Together with mathematical modelling our results suggest that co-localization probabilities in a spatially structured environment leave a small window of opportunity for the evolution of cooperation between organisms that do not benefit from their cooperative trait when in isolation or form multispecies aggregates."

In view of this, there is an outstanding need for in vitro systems in which to assess the impact of both infectious agents and xenobiotic substances of the lungs. To address this issue, we have developed a protocol to generate airway epithelial basal-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells, which simplifies the manufacture of cellular models of the human upper airways. Basal-like cells generated in this study were cultured on transwell inserts to allow formation of a confluent monolayer and then exposed to an air-liquid interface to induce differentiation into a pseudostratified epithelial construct with a marked similarity to the upper airway epithelium in vivo. These constructs contain the component cell types required of an epithelial model system, produce mucus and functional cilia, and can support SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication and the secretion of cytokines in a manner similar to that of in vivo airways. This method offers a readily accessible and highly scalable protocol for the manufacture of upper airway models that could find applications in development of therapies for respiratory viral infections and the assessment of drug toxicity on the human lungs."

However, due to its laborious and cost intensive nature, iPSC research is often plagued by limited sample size and putative large variability between clones, decreasing statistical power for detecting experimental effects. Here, we investigate the source and magnitude of variability in the proteome of parallel differentiated astrocytes using mass spectrometry. We compare three possible sources of variability: inter-donor variability, inter- and intra-clonal variability, at different stages of maturation. We show that the interclonal variability is significantly smaller than the inter-donor variability, and that including more donors has a much larger influence on statistical power than adding more clones per donor. Our results provide insight into the sources of variability at protein level between iPSC samples derived in parallel and will aid in optimizing iPSC studies."

Here we investigated the temporal transcriptomic alterations (TempO-Seq) of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived renal proximal tubule-like (PTL) cells exposed to 5 \u03bcM cadmium chloride for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 72 and 168 h. There was an early activation (within 4 h) of the metal and oxidative stress responses (metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF1) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) genes). The Nrf2 response returned to baseline within 24 h. The Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) regulated genes HSPA6 and FOSL-1 followed the Nrf2 time course. While the MTF1 genes also spiked at 4 h, they remained strongly elevated over the entire exposure period. The data and cell culture model utilised will be useful in further research aimed at the refinement of safe human exposure limits for cadmium, other metals and their mixtures."

  "description": "A method to monitor the NAD+ metabolome\u2014from mechanistic to clinical applicationsNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form (NADH) are coenzymes employed in hundreds of metabolic reactions. NAD+ also serves as a substrate for enzymes such as sirtuins, poly(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and ADP\u2010ribosyl cyclases. Given the pivotal role of NAD(H) in health and disease, studying NAD+ metabolism has become essential to monitor ge-netic\u2010 and/or drug\u2010induced perturbations related to metabolic status and diseases (such as ageing, cancer or obesity), and its possible therapies. Here, we present a strategy based on liquid chroma-tography\u2010tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS), for the analysis of the NAD+ metabolome in biological samples. In this method, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) was used to sep-arate a total of 18 metabolites belonging to pathways leading to NAD+ biosynthesis, including pre-cursors, intermediates and catabolites. As redox cofactors are known for their instability, a sample preparation procedure was developed to handle a variety of biological matrices: cell models, rodent tissues and biofluids, as well as human biofluids (urine, plasma, serum, whole blood). For clinical applications, quantitative LC\u2010MS/MS for a subset of metabolites was demonstrated for the analysis of the human whole blood of nine volunteers. Using this developed workflow, our methodology allows studying NAD+ biology from mechanistic to clinical applications."

Most inhibitors of NNMT described to date are structurally related to one or both of its substrates. In the search for structurally diverse NNMT inhibitors, an mRNA display screening technique was used to identify macrocyclic peptides which bind to NNMT. Several of the cyclic peptides identified in this manner show potent inhibition of NNMT with IC50 values as low as 229 nM. The peptides were also found to downregulate MNA production in cellular assays. Interestingly, substrate competition experiments reveal that these cyclic peptide inhibitors are noncompetitive with either SAM or NA indicating they may be the first allosteric inhibitors reported for NNMT."

  "description": "Project earthrise: Proceedings of the ninth annual conference of inVIVO planetary healthThe \u201cEarthrise\u201d photograph, taken on the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, became one of the most significant images of the 20th Century. It triggered a profound shift in environmental awareness and the potential for human unity\u2014inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970. Taking inspiration from these events 50 years later, we initiated Project Earthrise at our 2020 annual conference of inVIVO Planetary Health. This builds on the emergent concept of planetary health, which provides a shared narrative to integrate rich and diverse approaches from all aspects of society towards shared solutions to global challenges. The acute catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to many other interconnected global health, environmental, social, spiritual, and economic problems that have been underappreciated or neglected for decades. This is accelerating opportunities for greater collaborative action, as many groups now focus on the necessity of a \u201cGreat Transition\u201d. While ambitious integrative efforts have never been more important, it is imperative to apply these with mutualistic value systems as a compass, as we seek to make wiser choices. Project Earthrise is our contribution to this important process. This underscores the imperative for creative ecological solutions to challenges in all systems, on all scales with advancing global urbanization in the digital age\u2014for personal, environmental, economic and societal health alike. At the same time, our agenda seeks to equally consider our social and spiritual ecology as it does natural ecology. Revisiting the inspiration of \u201cEarthrise\u201d, we welcome diverse perspectives from across all dimensions of the arts and the sciences, to explore novel solutions and new normative values. Building on academic rigor, we seek to place greater value on imagination, kindness and mutualism as we address our greatest challenges, for the health of people, places and planet."

  "description": "Efficient workflow for the investigation of the catalytic cycle of water oxidation catalysts: Combining GFN-xTB and density functional theoryPhotocatalytic water oxidation remains the bottleneck in many artificial photosynthesis devices. The efficiency of this challenging process is inherently linked to the thermodynamic and electronic properties of the chromophore and the water oxidation catalyst (WOC). Computational investigations can facilitate the search for favorable chromophore-catalyst combinations. However, this remains a demanding task due to the requirements on the computational method that should be able to correctly describe different spin and oxidation states of the transition metal, the influence of solvation and the different rates of the charge transfer and water oxidation processes. To determine a suitable method with favorable cost/accuracy ratios, the full catalytic cycle of a molecular ruthenium based WOC is investigated using different computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT) with different functionals (GGA, Hybrid, Double Hybrid) as well as the semi-empirical tight binding approach GFN-xTB. A workflow with low computational cost is proposed that combines GFN-xTB and DFT and provides reliable results. GFN-xTB geometries and frequencies combined with single-point DFT energies give free energy changes along the catalytic cycle that closely follow the full DFT results and show satisfactory agreement with experiment, while significantly decreasing the computational cost. This workflow allows for cost efficient determination of energetic, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of WOCs."

  "description": "Atypical and Asymmetric 1,3-P,N Ligands: Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of CycloiminophosphanesNovel seven-membered cyclic imine-based 1,3-P,N ligands were obtained by capturing a Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate generated in situ from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These \u201ccycloiminophosphanes\u201d possess flexible non-isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity; this sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated by using their P-\u03ba1- and P,N-\u03ba2-tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the trans-CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl2]2 demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, giving a dynamic equilibrium of \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the \u03ba2 complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the RuII-catalyzed, solvent-free hydration of benzonitrile and the RuII- and IrI-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from l-menthone, as well as their P,N-\u03ba2-RhIII and a P-\u03ba1-RuII complexes."

  "description": "Dipolar repulsion in \u03b1-halocarbonyl compounds revisitedThe concept of dipolar repulsion has been widely used to explain several phenomena in organic chemistry, including the conformational preferences of carbonyl compounds. This model, in which atoms and bonds are viewed as point charges and dipole moment vectors, respectively, is however oversimplified. To provide a causal model rooted in quantitative molecular orbital theory, we have analyzed the rotational isomerism of haloacetaldehydes OHC-CH2X (X = F, Cl, Br, I), using relativistic density functional theory. We have found that the overall trend in the rotational energy profiles is set by the combined effects of Pauli repulsion (introducing a barrier around gauche that separates minima at syn and anti), orbital interactions (which can pull the anti minimum towards anticlinal to maximize hyperconjugation), and electrostatic interactions. Only for X = F, not for X = Cl-I, electrostatic interactions push the preference from syn to anti. Our bonding analyses show how this trend is related to the compact nature of F versus the more diffuse nature of the heavier halogens."

The studied LAs efficiently accelerate the ene reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 12 kcal mol\u22121 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that coordination of a LA catalyst to the enophile decreases the reaction barrier of the ene reaction by inducing an asymmetry in the \u03c0-electronic system, which increases the asynchronicity and hence relieves the otherwise highly destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled \u03c0-orbitals of the ene and enophile. In all, these findings further demonstrate the generality of the Pauli-lowering catalysis concept."

A combination of laser desorption, mass spectrometry and conformational selective IR-UV action spectroscopy allows us to obtain detailed structural insights into the formation processes of the cyclic l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine dipeptide (named cyclo-FF) aggregates. The rigid properties of cyclo-FF result in highly resolved IR spectra for the smaller clusters (n \u2264 3) and corresponding conformational assignments. For the higher order clusters (n > 3) the spectra are less resolved, however the observed ratios, peak positions and trends in IR shifts are key to make predictions on their structural details. Whereas the mid-IR spectral region between 1000-1800 cm-1 turns out to be undiagnostic for these small aggregates and the 3 \u03bcm region only for specific calculated structures, the far-IR contains valuable information that allows for clear assignments.

  "description": "Electronic spectra of ytterbium fluoride from relativistic electronic structure calculationsWe report an investigation of the low-lying excited states of the YbF molecule-a candidate molecule for experimental measurements of the electron electric dipole moment-with 2-component based multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI), equation of motion coupled cluster (EOM-CCSD) and the extrapolated intermediate Hamiltonian Fock-space coupled cluster (XIHFS-CCSD). Specifically, we address the question of the nature of these low-lying states in terms of configurations containing filled or partially-filled Yb 4f shells. We show that while it does not appear possible to carry out calculations with both kinds of configurations contained in the same active space, reliable information can be extracted from different sectors of Fock space-that is, by performing electron attachment and detachment IHFS-CCSD and EOM-CCSD calculation on the closed-shell YbF+ and YbF- species, respectively. From these calculations we predict \u03a9 = 1/2, 3/2 states, arising from the 4f13\u03c326s, 4f145d1/6p1, and 4f135d1\u03c316s configurations to be able to interact as they appear in the same energy range around the ground-state equilibrium geometry. As these states are generated from different sectors of Fock space, they are almost orthogonal and provide complementary descriptions of parts of the excited state manifold. To obtain a comprehensive picture, we introduce a simple adiabatization model to extract energies of interacting \u03a9 = 1/2, 3/2 states that can be compared to experimental observations."

Plastics are widely used, e.g. as casings of consumer electronics (TVs, computers, routers, etc.), which are present in houses and offices in continuously increasing numbers. In this study, we investigate the estrogenic activity of components of plastics coming from electronics' casings. A recently developed fractionation platform for effect-directed analysis (EDA) was used. This platform combines reversed-phase liquid chromatography in parallel with bioassay detection via nanofractionation and with online high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) for the identification of bioactives. Four out of eight of the analyzed plastics samples showed the presence of estrogenic compounds. Based on the MS results these were assigned to bisphenol A (BPA), 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, and a possible bisphenol A analog. All samples contained flame retardants, but these did not show any estrogenicity. The observed BPA, however, could be an impurity of tetrabromo-BPA (TBBPA) or TBBPA-based flame retardants. Due to the plausible migration of additives from plastics into the environment, plastics from consumer electronics likely constitute a source of estrogenic compound contamination in the indoor environment."

Applying LOBICO to a large cancer cell line panel, we find that logic combinations of multiple mutations are more predictive of drug response than single gene predictors.

  "description": "Legacy and alternative halogenated flame retardants in human milk in Europe: Implications for children's healthIn this study, 10 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 19 alternative halogenated flame retardants (AFRs) were determined in > 450 human milk samples across three European countries, representing northern, western and eastern Europe. This study provides first insights into the occurrence of selected AFRs in mother milk samples and compares them among three European countries. Sums of median concentrations of the most frequently detected PBDEs were 2.16, 0.88 and 0.45 ng g\u22121 lipid weight (lw) in Norway, the Netherlands and Slovakia, respectively. The sum of the concentrations of AFRs ranged from 0.14 to 0.25 ng g\u22121 lw in all countries, which was 2 to 15 times less compared to \u03a37PBDEs. The Penta-BDE replacement, bis(2-ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate, BEH-TEBP, was present at the greatest concentrations of any of the AFRs and in some samples exceeded concentrations of BDE 47 and BDE 153. Four AFRs including bromobenzenes (hexabromobenzene, pentabromobenzene, pentabromotoluene) and another Penta-BDE replacement (2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate, EH-TBB) were detected in > 42% of all human milk samples. Because of the potential developmental neurotoxicity of the halogenated flame retardants, infant dietary intakes via breastfeeding were estimated; in four cases the intakes of BDE 47 exceeded the reference dose indicating that the present concentrations may pose a risk for children."

At 30 C it was possible to produce 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate from 3-phosphoglycerate withphosphoglycerate kinase, but at 70 C, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate was dephosphorylated rapidly to 3-phosphoglycerate,effectively turning the phosphoglycerate kinase into a futile cycle. When phosphoglycerate kinase was incubated togetherwith glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase it was possible to convert 3-phosphoglycerate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, both at 30 C and at 70 C, however, at 70 C only low concentrations of product were observed due to thermalinstability of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Thus, thermolabile intermediates challenge central metabolic reactions andrequire special adaptation strategies for life at high temperature."

  "description": "Probing the genome-scale metabolic landscape of Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping coughWhooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis. Despite widespread vaccination, its incidence has been rising alarmingly, and yet, the physiology of B. pertussis remains poorly understood. We combined genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, a novel optimization algorithm, and experimental data to probe the full metabolic potential of this pathogen, using B. pertussis strain Tohama I as a reference. Experimental validation showed that B. pertussis secretes a significant proportion of nitrogen as arginine and purine nucleosides, which may contribute to modulation of the host response. We also found that B. pertussis can be unexpectedly versatile, being able to metabolize many compounds while displaying minimal nutrient requirements. It can grow without cysteine, using inorganic sulfur sources, such as thiosulfate, and it can grow on organic acids, such as citrate or lactate, as sole carbon sources, providing in vivo demonstration that its tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is functional. Although the metabolic reconstruction of eight additional strains indicates that the structural genes underlying this metabolic flexibility are widespread, experimental validation suggests a role of strain-specific regulatory mechanisms in shaping metabolic capabilities. Among five alternative strains tested, three strains were shown to grow on substrate combinations requiring a functional TCA cycle, but only one strain could use thiosulfate. Finally, the metabolic model was used to rationally design growth media with > 2-fold improvements in pertussis toxin production. This study thus provides novel insights into B. pertussis physiology and highlights the potential, but also the limitations, of models based solely on metabolic gene content."

  "description": "Role of the Chalcogen (S, Se, Te) in the Oxidation Mechanism of the Glutathione Peroxidase Active SiteThe oxidation by H2O2 of the human phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx4), used as a model peroxidase selenoenzyme, as well as that of its cysteine (Cys) and tellurocysteine (Tec) mutants, was investigated in silico through a combined classic and quantum mechanics approach to assess the role of the different chalcogens. To perform this analysis, new parameters for selenocysteine (Sec) and tellurocysteine (Tec) were accurately derived for the AMBER ff14SB force field. The oxidation represents the initial step of the antioxidant activity of GPx, which catalyzes the reduction of H2O2 and organic hydroperoxides by glutathione (GSH). A mechanism involving a charge-separation intermediate is feasible for the Cys and Sec enzymes, leading from the initial thiol/selenol form to sulfenic/selenenic acid, whereas for the Tec mutant a direct oxidation pathway is proposed. Activation strain analyses, performed for Cys-GPx and Sec-GPx, provided insight into the rate-accelerating effect of selenium as compared to sulfur and the role of specific amino acids other than Cys/Sec that are typically conserved in the catalytic pocket."

  "description": "Increased Conformational Flexibility of a Macrocycle\u2013Receptor Complex Contributes to Reduced Dissociation RatesConstraining a peptide in its bioactive conformation by macrocyclization represents a powerful strategy to design modulators of challenging biomolecular targets. This holds particularly true for the development of inhibitors of protein-protein interactions which often involve interfaces lacking defined binding pockets. Such flat surfaces are demanding targets for traditional small molecules rendering macrocyclic peptides promising scaffolds for novel therapeutics. However, the contribution of peptide dynamics to binding kinetics is barely understood which impedes the design process. Herein, we report unexpected trends in the binding kinetics of two closely related macrocyclic peptides that bind their receptor protein with high affinity. Isothermal titration calorimetry, 19F NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that increased conformational flexibility of the macrocycle\u2013receptor complex reduces dissociation rates and contributes to complex stability. This observation has impact on macrocycle design strategies that have so far mainly focused on the stabilization of bioactive ligand conformations."

  "description": "Mode of Action Assignment of Chemicals Using Toxicogenomics: A Case Study with Oxidative UncouplersA criterion frequently used to group chemicals in risk assessment is \u201cmode of toxic action\u201d (MoA). Routinely, structure-based approaches are used for the MoA categorization of chemicals, but they can produce conflicting results or fail to classify compounds. Biological activity-based approaches such as toxicogenomics which provide an unbiased overview of the transcriptomic changes after exposure to a compound may complement structure-based approaches in MoA assignment. Here, we investigate whether toxicogenomic profiles as generated after in vitro exposure of an established cell line (C3A hepatoma cells) are able to group together chemicals with an uncoupling MoA, and to distinguish the uncouplers from chemicals with other MoAs. In a first step, we examined whether chemicals sharing the same uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) MoA produce similar toxicogenomic profiles and can be grouped together. In a next step, we tested whether the toxicogenomic profiles discriminate between OXPHOS and chemicals displaying a (polar) narcotic MoA. Experimentally, cells were exposed in vitro to equipotent concentrations of the test compounds and gene expression profiles were measured. The resulting toxicogenomic profiles assigned OXPHOS to one cluster and discriminated between the OXPHOS and the (polar) narcotics. In addition, the toxicogenomics data revealed that one and the same chemical can display multiple MoAs, which may help to explain conflicting results of MoA classification from structure-based approaches. The results strongly suggest the feasibility of MoA grouping of chemicals by using in vitro cell assay-based toxicogenomic profiles."

  "description": "Approximate energy functionals for one-body reduced density matrix functional theory from many-body perturbation theoryWe develop a systematic approach to construct energy functionals of the one-particle reduced density matrix (1RDM) for equilibrium systems at finite temperature. The starting point of our formulation is the grand potential \u03a9[G] regarded as variational functional of the Green\u2019s function G based on diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory and for which we consider either the Klein or Luttinger\u2013Ward form. By restricting the input Green\u2019s function to be one-to-one related to a set on one-particle reduced density matrices (1RDM) this functional becomes a functional of the 1RDM. To establish the one-to-one mapping we use that, at any finite temperature and for a given 1RDM \u03b3 in a finite basis, there exists a non-interacting system with a spatially non-local potential v[\u03b3] which reproduces the given 1RDM. The corresponding set of non-interacting Green\u2019s functions defines the variational domain of the functional \u03a9. In the zero temperature limit we obtain an energy functional E[\u03b3] which by minimisation yields an approximate ground state 1RDM and energy. As an application of the formalism we use the Klein and Luttinger\u2013Ward functionals in the GW-approximation to compute the binding curve of a model hydrogen molecule using an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian. We compare further to the case in which we evaluate the functionals on a Hartree\u2013Fock and a Kohn\u2013Sham Green\u2019s function. We find that the Luttinger\u2013Ward version of the functionals performs the best and is able to reproduce energies close to the GW energy which corresponds to the stationary point."

  "description": "Linking cytochrome P450 enzymes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis to their cognate ferredoxin partnersMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) codes for 20 cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), considered potential drug-targets due to their essential roles in bacterial viability and host infection. Catalytic activity of mycobacterial CYPs is dependent on electron transfer from a NAD (P)H-ferredoxin-reductase (FNR) and a ferredoxin (Fd). Two FNRs (FdrA and FprA) and five ferredoxins (Fdx, FdxA, FdxC, FdxD, and Rv1786) have been found in the Mtb genome. However, as of yet, the cognate redox partnerships have not been fully established. This is confounded by the fact that heterologous redox partners are routinely used to reconstitute Mtb CYP metabolism. To this end, this study aimed to biochemically characterize and identify cognate redox partnerships for Mtb CYPs. Interestingly, all combinations of FNRs and ferredoxins were active in the reduction of oxidized cytochrome c, but steady-state kinetic assays revealed FdxD as the most efficient redox partner for FdrA, whereas Fdx coupled preferably with FprA. CYP121A1, CYP124A1, CYP125A1, and CYP142A1 metabolism with the cognate redox partners was reconstituted in vitro showing an unanticipated selectivity in the requirement for electron transfer partnership, which did not necessarily correlate with proximity in the genome. This is the first description of microbial P450 metabolism in which multiple ferredoxins are functionally linked to multiple CYPs."

Although omitting water during the administration of Sporanox\u00ae resulted in noticeably higher duodenal concentrations of itraconazole, systemic exposure was almost unaffected. It is assumed that this discrepancy can be explained by differences in the extent of entrapment of itraconazole in the duodenum caused by differential complexation depending on the concentration of cyclodextrins. To further substantiate this hypothesis, the quantification of HP-\u03b2-CD concentrations in the aspirated intestinal fluids was performed by LC-MS/MS. When comparing the intestinal concentrations of itraconazole and HP-\u03b2-CD for one single healthy volunteer (HV02) in both test conditions, an excellent correlation was observed (Spearman's rank coefficient of 0.96). Moreover, the data suggest that, similar to aqueous buffer media, also in human intestinal fluids a non-linear relationship exists between itraconazole solubility and HP-\u03b2-CD concentration (Ap-type profile; Spearman's rank coefficient of 0.78), indicating that higher order complexes are formed at higher concentrations of HP-\u03b2-CD. This difference in extent of entrapment in the inclusion complexes helps to understand the observed impact of water intake on precipitation and permeation behavior of itraconazole in man. Without water intake, higher HP-\u03b2-CD concentrations resulted in less precipitation and increased duodenal concentrations of itraconazole. On the other hand, the stronger interaction at higher HP-\u03b2-CD concentrations reduced the free fraction of the drug explaining that increased intraluminal concentrations of itraconazole were not translated into an enhanced uptake. In conclusion, quantifying the concentrations of the solubilizing agent HP-\u03b2-CD in human intestinal fluids appeared to be of crucial importance to interpret the intraluminal behavior of an orally administered cyclodextrin-based solution."

  "description": "Motif-Aware PRALINE: Improving the alignment of motif regions: Improving the alignment of motif regionsProtein or DNA motifs are sequence regions which possess biological importance. These regions are often highly conserved among homologous sequences. The generation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) with a correct alignment of the conserved sequence motifs is still difficult to achieve, due to the fact that the contribution of these typically short fragments is overshadowed by the rest of the sequence. Here we extended the PRALINE multiple sequence alignment program with a novel motif-aware MSA algorithm in order to address this shortcoming. This method can incorporate explicit information about the presence of externally provided sequence motifs, which is then used in the dynamic programming step by boosting the amino acid substitution matrix towards the motif. The strength of the boost is controlled by a parameter, \u03b1. Using a benchmark set of alignments we confirm that a good compromise can be found that improves the matching of motif regions while not significantly reducing the overall alignment quality. By estimating \u03b1 on an unrelated set of reference alignments we find there is indeed a strong conservation signal for motifs. A number of typical but difficult MSA use cases are explored to exemplify the problems in correctly aligning functional sequence motifs and how the motif-aware alignment method can be employed to alleviate these problems."

  "description": "RNA versus DNA G-Quadruplex: The Origin of Increased StabilityDNA quadruplexes have been the subject of investigation because of their biological relevance and because of their potential application in supramolecular chemistry. Similarly, RNA quadruplexes are now gaining increasing attention. Although DNA and RNA quadruplexes are structurally very similar, the latter show higher stability. In this study we report dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) quantum chemical calculations that were undertaken to understand the difference in stabilities of RNA and DNA quadruplexes. The smallest meaningful model of a stack of quartets, interacting with alkali metal cations, was simulated in an aqueous environment. The energy decomposition analysis allows for in-depth examination of the interaction energies, emphasising the role of noncovalent interactions and better electrostatics in determining RNA-GQs higher stabilities, particularly pinpointing the role of the extra 2\u2032-OH groups. Furthermore, our computations present new insights on why the cation is required for self-assembly: unexpectedly the cation is not necessary to relieve the repulsion between the oxygen atoms in the central cavity, but it is needed to overcome the entropic penalty."

  "description": "The long duration of action of the second generation antihistamine bilastine coincides with its long residence time at the histamine H1 receptorDrug-target binding kinetics has recently attracted considerable interest in view of the potential predictive power for in vivo drug efficacy. The recently introduced antihistamine bilastine has a long duration of in vivo drug action, which outlasts pharmacological active bilastine concentrations in blood. To provide a molecular basis for the long duration of action, we explored the kinetics of bilastine binding to the human histamine H1 receptor using [3H]mepyramine binding studies and compared its pharmacodynamics properties to the reference compounds fexofenadine and diphenhydramine, which have a long (60 \u00b1 20 min) and short (0.41 \u00b1 0.1 min) residence time, respectively. Bilastine shows a long drug-target residence time at the H1 receptor (73 \u00b1 5 min) and this results in a prolonged H1 receptor antagonism in vitro (Ca2+ mobilization in Fluo-4 loaded HeLa cells), following a washout of unbound antagonist. Hence, the long residence time of bilastine can explain the observed long duration of drug action in vivo."

  "description": "Equation-of-motion coupled-cluster theory based on the 4-component Dirac-Coulomb(-Gaunt) Hamiltonian: Energies for single electron detachment, attachment, and electronically excited statesWe report in this paper an implementation of a 4-component relativistic Hamiltonian based Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster with singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) theory for the calculation of ionization potential, electron affinity, and excitation energy. In this work, we utilize the previously developed double group symmetry-based generalized tensor contraction scheme and also extend it in order to carry out tensor contractions involving non-totally symmetric and odd-ranked tensors. Several approximated spin-free and two-component Hamiltonians can also be accessed in this implementation. We have applied this method to the halogen monoxide (XO, X = Cl, Br, I, At, Ts) species, in order to assess the quality of a few other recent EOM-CCSD implementations, where spin-orbit coupling contribution has been approximated in different degrees. Besides, we have also studied various excited states of CH2IBr, CH2I2, and I3- (as well as single electron attachment and detachment electronic states of the same species) where comparison has been made with a closely related multi-reference coupled-cluster method, namely, Intermediate Hamiltonian Fock Space Coupled-Cluster singles and doubles theory."

  "description": "The Phosphine Oxide Route toward Lead Halide Perovskite NanocrystalsWe report an amine-free synthesis of lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals, using trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) instead of aliphatic amines, in combination with a protic acid (e.g., oleic acid). The overall synthesis scheme bears many similarities to the chemistry behind the preparation of LHP thin films and single crystals, in terms of ligand coordination to the chemical precursors. The acidity of the environment and hence the extent of protonation of the TOPO molecules tune the reactivity of the PbX2 precursor, regulating the size of the nanocrystals. On the other hand, TOPO molecules are virtually absent from the surface of our nanocrystals, which are simply passivated by one type of ligand (e.g., Cs-oleate). Furthermore, our studies reveal that Cs-oleate is dynamically bound to the surface of the nanocrystals and that an optimal surface coverage is critical for achieving high photoluminescence quantum yield. Our scheme delivers NCs with a controlled size and shape: only cubes are formed, with no contamination with platelets, regardless of the reaction conditions that were tested. We attribute such a shape homogeneity to the absence of primary aliphatic amines in our reaction environment, since these are known to promote the formation of nanocrystals with sheet/platelet morphologies or layered phases under certain reaction conditions. The TOPO route is particularly appealing with regard to synthesizing LHP nanocrystals for large-scale manufacturing, as the yield in terms of material produced is close to the theoretical limit: i.e., almost all precursors employed in the synthesis are converted into nanocrystals."

  "description": "The Surface Chemistry of Colloidal HgSe Nanocrystals, toward Stoichiometric Quantum Dots by DesignThe prevalent structure of binary semiconductor nanocrystals is a crystallite enriched in metal cations and terminated by anionic surface species that are classified as X-type ligands. Here, we demonstrate that HgSe NCs synthesized from selenourea and mercury chloride in oleylamine have a stoichiometry close to that of bulk HgSe and feature a surface terminated by oleylammonium chloride: a combination of composition and ligand capping that preserves charge neutrality. We demonstrate that oleylammonium chloride can be formed as a side product of the formation of HgSe in the particular reaction mixture used. We complement the experimental work with a detailed investigation by density functional theory of a [HgSe]55 model system. This analysis confirms that the combination of a stoichiometric HgSe nanocrystal and alkylammonium chloride ligands forms a stable structure. Moreover, DFT predicts that stoichiometric HgSe nanocrystals prefer binding of methylammonium chloride over binding of mercury chloride. We thus conclude that HgSe NCs are retrieved with this unconventional surface termination because it is (1) possible by synthesis and (2) preferred by thermodynamics. Finally, we argue that the identification of surface ligands as acids or bases provides a convenient alternative to the covalent bond classification for describing NC-ligand binding motifs involving ion-pairs."

Here, we exploited the tractability of the BTZ scaffold by attaching a range of fluorophores to the 2-substituent of the BTZ ring via short linkers. We show by means of fluorescence imaging that the most advanced derivative, JN108, is capable of efficiently labeling its target, the essential flavoenzyme DprE1, both in cell-free extracts and after purification as well as in growing cells of different actinobacterial species. DprE1 displays a polar localization in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. marinum, M. smegmatis, and Nocardia farcinica but not in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Finally, mutation of the cysteine residue in DprE1 in these species, to which BTZ covalently binds, abolishes completely the interaction with JN108, thereby highlighting the specificity of this fluorescent probe."

  "description": "The characteristics of molten globule states and folding pathways strongly depend on the sequence of a proteinThe majority of proteins perform their cellular function after folding into a specific and stable native structure. Additionally, for many proteins less compact \u2018molten globule\u2019 states have been observed. Current experimental observations show that the molten globule state can show varying degrees of compactness and solvent accessibility; the underlying molecular cause for this variation is not well understood. While the specificity of protein folding can be studied using protein lattice models, current design procedures for these models tend to generate sequences without molten globule-like behaviour. Here we alter the design process so the distance between the molten globule ensemble and the native structure can be steered; this allows us to design protein sequences with a wide range of folding pathways, and sequences with well-defined heat-induced molten globules. Simulating these sequences we find that (1) molten globule states are compact, but have less specific configurations compared to the folded state, (2) the nature of the molten globule state is highly sequence dependent, (3) both two-state and multi-state folding proteins may show heat-induced molten globule states, as observed in heat capacity curves. The varying nature of the molten globules and typical heat capacity curves associated with the transitions closely resemble experimental observations."

In this work, we have systematically explored and analyzed chalcogen-\u03c0 interactions in model systems X2D\u22efA (with D = O, S, Se, Te; X = halogen; A = acetylene, ethylene and 2-butyne), using relativistic density functional theory (DFT).

We find that chalcogen-\u03c0 bonds increase in strength as the X-D electronegativity difference becomes greater.

For the determination of the model value for the polarizability from QM/MM, we show that our proposed consensus-fitting strategy significantly reduces the uncertainty in calculated polarizabilities in cases where the size of the local external electric field is small. By fitting electrostatic, polarization and dispersion properties of our water model based on quantum and/or combined QM/MM calculations, only a single model parameter (describing exchange repulsion) is left for empirical calibration. The resulting model performs well in describing relevant pure-liquid thermodynamic and transport properties, which illustrates the merit of our approach to minimize the number of free variables in our model."

This review explores the two primary kinase classes, the eukaryotic protein kinases (ePKs) and the atypical protein kinases (aPKs), and provides a structure-centered comparison of their sequences, structures, hydrophobic spines, mutation and SNP hotspots, and inhibitor interaction patterns. Despite the limited sequence similarity between these two classes, atypical kinases commonly share the archetypical kinase fold but lack conserved eukaryotic kinase motifs and possess altered hydrophobic spines. Furthermore, atypical kinase inhibitors explore only a limited number of binding modes both inside and outside the orthosteric binding site. The distribution of genetic variations in both classes shows multiple ways they can interfere with kinase inhibitor binding. This multilayered review provides a research framework bridging the eukaryotic and atypical kinase classes."

  "description": "Primary endometrial 3D co-cultures: A comparison between human and rat endometriumHuman and rat reproductive systems differ significantly with respect to hormonal cyclicity and endometrial cell behavior. However, species-differences in endometrial cell responses upon hormonal stimulation and exposure to potentially toxic compounds are poorly characterized. In this study, human and rat endometrial hormonal responses were assessed in vitro using a 3D co-culture model of primary human and rat endometrial cells. The models were exposed to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), laquinimod, and its AHR active metabolite DELAQ. In both the human and rat endometrial models, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor gene expression was modulated by the hormonal treatments, comparable to the in vivo situation. AHR gene expression in the human endometrial model did not change when exposed to hormones. In contrast, AHR expression decreased 2-fold in the rat model when exposed to predominantly progesterone, which resulted in a 2.8-fold attenuation of gene expression induction of cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) by TCDD. TCDD and DELAQ, but not laquinimod, concentration-dependently induced CYP1A1 gene expression in both human and rat endometrial models. Interestingly, the relative degree of DELAQ to induce CYP1A1 was higher than that of TCDD in the human model, while it was lower in the rat model. These data clearly show species-differences in response to hormones and AHR ligands between human and rat endometrial cells in vitro, which might greatly affect the applicability of the rat as translational model for human endometrial effects. This warrants further development of human relevant, endometrium-specific test methods for risk assessment purposes."

Here we present a webserver that implements this method efficiently.RESULTS: With the aim of accelerating our previous approach, we obtained sequence conservation profiles by re-mastering the alignment of homologous sequences found by PSI-BLAST. This yielded a more than ten-fold speedup and at least the same accuracy, as reported previously for our method; these results allowed us to offer the method as a webserver. The web-server interface is targeted to the non-expert user. The input is simply a sequence of the protein of interest, and the output a table with scores indicating the likelihood of having an interaction interface at a certain position. As the method is sequence-based and not sensitive to the type of protein interaction, we expect this webserver to be of interest to many biological researchers in academia and in industry.AVAILABILITY: Webserver, source code and datasets are available at www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/serendipwww/."

  "description": "The human cytomegalovirus-encoded G protein- coupled receptor UL33 exhibits oncomodulatory propertiesHerpesviruses can rewire cellular signaling in host cells by expressing viral G protein- coupled receptors (GPCRs). These viral receptors exhibit homology to human chemokine receptors, but some display constitutive activity and promiscuous G protein coupling. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been detected in multiple cancers, including glioblastoma, and its genome encodes four GPCRs. One of these receptors, US28, is expressed in glioblastoma and possesses constitutive activity and oncomodulatory properties. UL33, another HCMV-encoded GPCR, also displays constitutive signaling via G\u03b1q, G\u03b1i, and G\u03b1s proteins. However, little is known about the nature and functional effects of UL33-driven signaling. Here, we assessed UL33's signaling repertoire and oncomodulatory potential. UL33 activated multiple proliferative, angiogenic, and inflammatory signaling pathways in HEK293T and U251 glioblastoma cells. Notably, upon infection, UL33 contributed to HCMV-mediated STAT3 activation. Moreover, UL33 increased spheroid growth in vitro and accelerated tumor growth in different in vivo tumor models, including an orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft model. UL33-mediated signaling was similar to that stimulated by US28; however, UL33-induced tumor growth was delayed. Additionally, the spatiotemporal expression of the two receptors only partially overlapped in HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, our results unveil that UL33 has broad signaling capacity and provide mechanistic insight into its functional effects. UL33, like US28, exhibits oncomodulatory properties, elicited via constitutive activation of multiple signaling pathways. UL33 and US28 might contribute to HCMV's oncomodulatory effects through complementing and converging cellular signaling, and hence UL33 may represent a promising drug target in HCMV-associated malignancies."

Our goal is to transform personal and planetary health through awareness, attitudes, and actions, and a deeper understanding of how all systems are interconnected and interdependent. Here, we present the abstracts and proceedings of our 8th annual conference, held in Detroit, Michigan in May 2019, themed \u201cFrom Challenges, to Opportunities\u201d. Our far-ranging discussions addressed the complex interdependent ecological challenges of advancing global urbanization, including the biopsychosocial interactions in our living environment on physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing, together with the wider community and societal factors that govern these. We had a strong solutions focus, with diverse strategies spanning from urban-greening and renewal, nature-relatedness, nutritional ecology, planetary diets, and microbiome rewilding, through to initiatives for promoting resilience, positive emotional assets, traditional cultural narratives, creativity, art projects for personal and community health, and exploring ways of positively shifting mindsets and value systems. Our cross-sectoral agenda underscored the importance and global impact of local initiatives everywhere by contributing to new normative values as part of a global interconnected grass-roots movement for planetary health."

  "description": "Defects in lead halide perovskite nanocrystals: Analogies and (many) differences with the bulkUnderstanding the origin of defects in lead halide perovskite nanocrystals is paramount to attaining long-term structural stability and improved optical efficiency, key features for their successful implementation in optoelectronic devices. Unlike other studies, we explore the possible formation of trap states in explicit, nonperiodic CsPbBr3 nanocrystal models about 3 nm in size. Using density functional theory, we compute the defect formation energies of interstitial, vacancy, and antisite defects in different regions of the nanocrystal (center, surface center, and surface edge), demonstrating that the most stable defect position is found at the surface. We ascribe the high defect tolerance of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals to the fact that vacancies, i.e. the loss of surface ligands as ion pairs, are energetically difficult to form and only excessive stripping of surface ligands might be problematic, as their detachment leaves undercoordinated Br- on the crystal surface that only in this case translates into deep traps."

  "description": "New Insights Into Cinnamoyl Esterase Activity of Oenococcus oeniSome strains of Oenococcus oeni possess cinnamoyl esterase activity that can be relevant in the malolactic stage of wine production liberating hydroxycinnamic acids that are precursors of volatile phenols responsible for sensory faults. The objective of this study was to better understand the basis of the differential activity between strains. After initial screening, five commercial strains of O. oeni were selected, three were found to exhibit cinnamoyl esterase activity (CE+) and two not (CE\u2212). Although the use of functional annotation of genes revealed genotypic variations between the strains, no specific genes common only to the three CE+ strains could explain the different activities. Pasteurized wine was used as a natural source of tartrate esters in growth and metabolism experiments conducted in MRS medium, whilst commercial trans-caftaric acid was used as substrate for enzyme assays. Detoxification did not seem to be the main biological mechanism involved in the activity since unlike its phenolic cleavage products and their immediate metabolites (trans-caffeic acid and 4-ethylcatechol), trans-caftaric acid was not toxic toward O. oeni. In the case of the two CE+ strains OenosTM and CiNeTM, wine-exposed samples showed a more rapid degradation of trans-caftaric acid than the unexposed ones. The CE activity was present in all cell-free extracts of both wine-exposed and unexposed strains, except in the cell-free extracts of the CE\u2212 strain CH11TM. This activity may be constitutive rather than induced by exposure to tartrate esters. Trans-caftaric acid was totally cleaved to trans-caffeic acid by cell-free extracts of the three CE+ strains, whilst cell-free extracts of the CE\u2212 strain CH16TM showed significantly lower activity, although higher for the strains in experiments with no prior wine exposure. The EstB28 esterase gene, found in the genomes of the 5 strains, did not reveal any difference on the upstream regulation and transport functionality between the strains. This study highlights the complexity of the basis of this activity in wine related O. oeni population. Variable cinnamoyl esterases or/and membrane transport activities in the O. oeni strains analyzed and a possible implication of wine molecules could explain this phenomenon."

  "description": "Adopting traditional fermented foods as carriers for probiotics: The case of Obushera and Lactobacillus rhamnosus yobaPurpose: Traditional fermented products can be adopted as probiotic carriers. This study was aimed at evaluating the potential of using Obushera, a traditional sorghum beverage from Uganda, as a carrier for Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba. Design/methodology/approach: Probiotic Obushera was produced by fermenting sorghum malt with Lb. rhamnosus yoba 2012 and Streptococcus thermophilus C106 at 30 \u00b0C and at room temperature (21\u00b0C-25 \u00b0C) for 24 h. Acidity, pH, total soluble solids and microbial counts were monitored. Consumer acceptability and purchase index of probiotic Obushera were compared to four commercial non-probiotic brands. Shelf stability of probiotic Obushera was determined by monitoring changes in pH, acidity, soluble solids, microbial counts and consumer acceptability during refrigerated storage. Findings: Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 multiplied and lowered the pH of Obushera from 5.3 to < 4.0 (p < 0.0001) whilst increasing acidity from 0.21 to 0.46 per cent (p < 0.0001) in 9 h at 30 \u00b0C. Consumer acceptability varied with Obushera brand (p < 0.0001). The overall acceptability score of probiotic Obushera (score of 6.4 = like slightly) was similar to that of the two most acceptable commercial brands (scores of 5.8 and 6.6). Acidity, pH and Lb. rhamnosus counts of probiotic Obushera varied within 0.6 per cent \u20131.05 per cent (p < 0.0001), 3.3\u20133.4 (p < 0.0001), and 8.2-9.2 log cfu/ml (p < 0.0001), respectively during two months of storage. The overall acceptability of probiotic Obushera (scores of 6.9-7.8) did not change significantly during storage (p = 0.185). Practical Implications: Traditional fermented foods such as Obushera can be adopted as carriers of probiotic microorganisms. Originality/value: Use of commercial probiotic strains in traditional fermented foods is a novel approach that can be adopted to improve safety of traditional fermentations and health of consumers."

  "description": "Constrained Peptides with Fine-Tuned Flexibility Inhibit NF-Y Transcription Factor AssemblyProtein complex formation depends on the interplay between preorganization and flexibility of the binding epitopes involved. The design of epitope mimetics typically focuses on stabilizing a particular bioactive conformation, often without considering conformational dynamics, which limits the potential of peptidomimetics against challenging targets such as transcription factors. We developed a peptide-derived inhibitor of the NF-Y transcription factor by first constraining the conformation of an epitope through hydrocarbon stapling and then fine-tuning its flexibility. In the initial set of constrained peptides, a single non-interacting \u03b1-methyl group was observed to have a detrimental effect on complex stability. Biophysical characterization revealed how this methyl group affects the conformation of the peptide in its bound state. Adaption of the methylation pattern resulted in a peptide that inhibits transcription factor assembly and subsequent recruitment to the target DNA."

In the current study, the reactivity of four-membered rings was carefully modulated to obtain a novel family of covalent MurA inhibitors. Screening a small library of cyclobutenone derivatives led to the identification of bromo-cyclobutenaminones as new electrophilic warheads. The electrophilic reactivity and cysteine specificity have been determined in a glutathione (GSH) and an oligopeptide assay, respectively. Investigating the structure-activity relationship for MurA suggests a crucial role for the bromine atom in the ligand. In addition, MS/MS experiments have proven the covalent labelling of MurA at Cys115 and the observed loss of the bromine atom suggests a net nucleophilic substitution as the covalent reaction. This new set of compounds might be considered as a viable chemical starting point for the discovery of new MurA inhibitors."

Previously, we developed a high resolution Effect-Directed Analysis (EDA) platform that combines liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry and parallel bioassay detection. In this study, the platform is combined with CALUX bioassays for (anti)androgenic, estrogenic and glucocorticoid activities, and the performance of the platform is evaluated. It appeared to render very repeatable results, with high recoveries of spiked compounds and high consistency between the mass spectrometric and bioassay results. Application of the platform to wastewater treatment plant effluent and surface water samples led to the identification of several compounds contributing to the measured activities. Eventually, a workflow is proposed for the application of the platform in a routine monitoring context. The workflow divides the platform into four phases, of which one to all can be performed depending on the research question and the results obtained. This allows one to make a balance between the effort put into the platform and the certainty and depth by which active compounds will be identified. The EDA platform is a valuable tool to identify unknown bioactive compounds, both in an academic setting as in the context of legislative, governmental or routine monitoring."

  "description": "Neurobehavioral effects of cyanobacterial biomass field extracts on zebrafish embryos and potential role of retinoidsCyanobacteria are known for their ability to produce and release mixtures of up to thousands of compounds into the environment. Recently, the production of novel metabolites, retinoids, was reported for some cyanobacterial species along with teratogenic effects of samples containing these compounds. Retinoids are natural endogenous substances derived from vitamin A that play a crucial role in early vertebrate development. Disruption of retinoid signalling- especially during the early development of the nervous system- might lead to major malfunctions and malformations. In this study, the toxicity of cyanobacterial biomass samples from the field containing retinoids was characterized by in vivo and in vitro bioassays with a focus on the potential hazards towards nervous system development and function. Additionally, in order to identify the compounds responsible for the observed in vitro and in vivo effects the complex cyanobacterial extracts were fractionated (C18 column, water-methanol gradient) and the twelve obtained fractions were tested in bioassays. In all bioassays, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was tested along with the environmental samples as a positive control. Retinoid-like activity (mediated via the retinoic acid receptor, RAR) was measured in the transgenic cell line p19/A15. The in vitro assay showed retinoid-like activity by specific interaction with RAR for the biomass samples. Neurotoxic effects of selected samples were studied on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos using the light/dark transition test (Viewpoint, ZebraLab system) with 120 hpf larvae. In the behavioural assay, the cyanobacterial extracts caused significant hyperactivity in zebrafish at 120 hpf after acute exposure (3 h prior to the measurement) at concentrations below the teratogenicity LOEC (0.2 g dw L\u22121). Similar effect was observed after exposure to fractions of the extracts with detected retinoid-like activity and additive effect was observed after combining the fractions. However, the effect on behaviour was not observed after exposure to ATRA only. To provide additional insight into the behavioural effects and describe the underlying mechanism gene expression of selected biomarkers was measured. We evaluated an array of 28 genes related to general toxicity, neurodevelopment, retinoid and thyroid signalling. We detected several affected genes, most notably, the Cyp26 enzymes that control endogenous ATRA concentration, which documents an effect on retinoid signalling."

Interestingly, compromised peptidoglycan synthesis, outer membrane biogenesis and LPS integrity predominantly activated the Rcs response, which we developed into a robust HTS (high-throughput screening) assay that is suited for phenotypic compound screening. Furthermore, by interrogating all three cell envelope stress reporters, and a reporter for the cytosolic heat-shock response as control, we found that inhibitors of specific envelope targets induce stress reporter profiles that are distinct in quality, amplitude and kinetics. Finally, we show that by using a host strain with a more permeable outer membrane, large-scaffold antibiotics can also be identified by the reporter assays. Together, the data suggest that stress profiling is a useful first filter for HTS aimed at inhibitors of cell envelope processes."

  "description": "Time integrative sampling properties of Speedisk and silicone rubber passive samplers determined by chemical analysis and in vitro bioassay testingCompared to grab samples, passive samplers have the advantage that they sample over a longer time period and can detect lower compound concentrations in water quality monitoring campaigns. To allow the determination of time-weighted average concentrations, however, sampler uptake should remain linear in time over the entire sampling period. Therefore, the time integrative or linear uptake properties of adsorption-based Speedisks and partitioning-based silicone rubber samplers were assessed with respect to chemically analyzed single compounds and measured bioactivity in in vitro bioassays. Both sampler types were deployed in consecutive and overlapping time series in a WTTP effluent and in the river Meuse up to 105 days. Extracts were chemically analyzed for PCBs, PAHs and pesticides and tested in the Aliivibrio fischeri and DR-LUC bioassays. Speedisks showed time integrative sampling for the detected pesticides as well as for bioassay responses at both sampling locations for the entire sampling period. The silicone rubber samplers showed poor linear uptake in time for the unknown compounds causing bioassay responses. The bioassay results indicate that conversion of a bioassay response to a passive sampler extract into a time-weighted average bioactivity per liter water seems justified for Speedisks, confirming that concentrations in the samplers correspond to a single volume of sampled water for all compounds. The bioassay results also indicate that a similar conversion for silicone rubber extracts should be interpreted with caution. In principle, it is actually impossible, because the concentration of each compound contributing to the bioassay response corresponds to a different sampled water volume."

This approach results in a priori estimates which are consistent in the limit when the regularization parameter goes to zero. In particular, we find a new proof of the existence of maximizing entropic-potentials and therefore, the existence of a solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger system. Our method extends also when we have more than two marginals: the main new result is the proof that the Sinkhorn algorithm converges even in the continuous multi-marginal case. This provides also an alternative proof of the convergence of the Sinkhorn algorithm in two marginals."

  "description": "A protein tertiary structure mimetic modulator of the Hippo signalling pathwayTranscription factors are key protein effectors in the regulation of gene transcription, and in many cases their activity is regulated via a complex network of protein\u2013protein interactions (PPI). The chemical modulation of transcription factor activity is a long-standing goal in drug discovery but hampered by the difficulties associated with the targeting of PPIs, in particular when extended and flat protein interfaces are involved. Peptidomimetics have been applied to inhibit PPIs, however with variable success, as for certain interfaces the mimicry of a single secondary structure element is insufficient to obtain high binding affinities. Here, we describe the design and characterization of a stabilized protein tertiary structure that acts as an inhibitor of the interaction between the transcription factor TEAD and its co-repressor VGL4, both playing a central role in the Hippo signalling pathway. Modification of the inhibitor with a cell-penetrating entity yielded a cell-permeable proteomimetic that activates cell proliferation via regulation of the Hippo pathway, highlighting the potential of protein tertiary structure mimetics as an emerging class of PPI modulators."

These substances can contain many constituents, sometimes partially unknown and/or variable, depending on fluctuations in their source material and/or manufacturing process. International regulatory agencies have highlighted the difficulties in characterizing UVCBs and assessing their toxicity and environmental fate. Several industrial sectors have attempted to address these issues by developing frameworks and characterization methods. Based on the output of a 2016 workshop, this critical review examines current practices for UVCB risk assessment and reveals a need for a multipronged and transparent approach integrating whole-substance and constituent-based information. In silico tools or empirical measurements can provide information on discrete and/or blocks of UVCB constituents with similar hazard properties. Read-across and/or whole-substance toxicity and fate testing using adapted emerging methods can provide whole-substance information. Continued collaboration of stakeholders representing government, industry, and academia will facilitate the development of practical testing strategies and guidelines for addressing regulatory requirements for UVCBs.

To improve its accuracy it is of interest to develop kinetic energy density functional approximations specifically for FDE applications. In the study reported here we focused on optimizing parameters of a generalized gradient approximation-like kinetic energy functional with the purpose of better describing electron excitation energies. We found that our optimized parametrizations, named excPBE and excPBE-3 (as these are derived from a Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof-like parametrization), could not yield improvements over available functionals when applied on a test set of systems designed to probe solvatochromic shifts. Moreover, as several different functionals yielded very similar errors to the simple local-density approximation (LDA), it is questionable whether it is worthwhile to go beyond the LDA in this context."

Here, we reveal the ligand shell architecture of Bi-doped Cs2Ag1-xNaxInCl6NCs via nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. This material, in its bulk form, was found to have a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as 86%, a record value for halide double perovskites. Our results show that both amines and carboxylic acids are present and homogeneously distributed over the surface of the NCs. Notably, even for an optimized surface ligand coating, achieved by combining dodecanoic acid and decylamine, a maximum PLQY value of only 37% is reached, with no further improvements observed when exploiting post-synthesis ligand exchange procedures (involving Cs-oleate, different ammonium halides, thiocyanates and sulfonic acids). Our density functional theory calculations indicate that, even with the best ligands combination, a small fraction of unpassivated surface sites, namely undercoordinated Cl ions, is sufficient to create deep trap states, opposite to the case of Pb-based perovskites that exhibit much higher defect tolerance. This was corroborated by our transient absorption measurements, which showed that an ultrafast trapping of holes (most likely mediated by surface Cl-trap states) competes with their localization at the AgCl6octahedra, from where, instead, they can undergo an optically active recombination yielding the observed PL emission. Our results highlight that alternative surface passivation strategies should be devised to further optimize the PLQY of double perovskite NCs, which might include their incorporation inside inorganic shells."

However, interpreting the label-free signal responses is challenging, and previously reported methods do not reliably separate pathways from each other. In this study, a continuous angular-scanning surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique is utilized for measuring label-free GPCR signal profiles. We show how the continuous angular-scanning ability, measuring up to nine real-time label-free parameters simultaneously, results in more information-rich label-free signal profiles for different GPCR pathways, providing a more accurate pathway separation. For this, we measured real-time full-angular SPR response curves for Gs, Gq, and Gi signaling pathways in living cells. By selecting two of the most prominent label-free parameters: the full SPR curve angular and intensity shifts, we present how this analysis approach can separate each of the three signaling pathways in a straightforward single-step analysis setup, without concurrent use of signal inhibitors or other response modulating compounds."

  "description": "Kohn-Sham equations with functionals from the strictly-correlated regime: Investigation with a spectral renormalization methodWe re-adapt a spectral renormalization method, introduced in nonlinear optics, to solve the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations of density functional theory, with a focus on functionals based on the strictly-correlated electrons (SCE) regime, which are particularly challenging to converge. Important aspects of the method are: (i) the eigenvalues and the density are computed simultaneously; (ii) it converges using randomized initial guesses; (iii) easy to implement. Using this method we could converge for the first time the Kohn-Sham equations with functionals that include the next leading term in the strong-interaction limit of density functional theory, the so called zero-point energy (ZPE) functional as well as with an interaction-strength-interpolation functional that includes both the exact SCE and ZPE terms. This work is the first building block for future studies on quantum systems confined in low dimensions with different statistics and long-range repulsions, such as localization properties of fermions and bosons with strong long-range repulsive interactions in the presence of a random external potential.

  "description": "Tuning the Binding Strength of even and Uneven Hydrogen-Bonded Arrays with Remote SubstituentsWe investigated the tunability of hydrogen bond strength by altering the charge accumulation around the frontier atoms with remote substituents. For pyridine\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H2O with NH2 and CN substituted at different positions on pyridine, we find that the electron-withdrawing CN group decreases the negative charge accumulation around the frontier atom N, resulting in weakening of the hydrogen bond, whereas the electron-donating NH2 group increases the charge accumulation around N, resulting in strengthening of the hydrogen bond. By applying these design principles on DDAA-AADD, DADA-ADAD, DAA-ADD, and ADA-DAD hydrogen-bonded dimers, we find that the effect of the substituent is delocalized over the whole molecular system. As a consequence, systems with an equal number of hydrogen bond donor (D) and acceptor (A) atoms are not tunable in a predictable way because of cancellation of counteracting strengthening and weakening effects. Furthermore, we show that the position of the substituent and long-range electrostatics can play an important role as well. Overall, the design principles presented in this work are suitable for monomers with an unequal number of donor and acceptor atoms and can be exploited to tune the binding strength of supramolecular building blocks."

In Phys. Rev. A 92, 012520 (2015)PLRAAN1050-294710.1103/PhysRevA.92.012520, Wang and Knowles initialized a discussion of to what extent this simplification is valid by introducing two different H4 geometries with identical natural occupation numbers but different 2RDMs. Gritsenko has argued that this feature is due symmetry [Phys. Rev. A 97, 026501 (2018)2469-992610.1103/PhysRevA.97.026501]. This work aims to contribute to the discussion on the following points: (1) one should rather speak of symmetry-restricted variants of the universal functional than saying that the universal functional is symmetry dependent; (2) the unitary invariance of degenerate NOs can lead to large deviations in the 2RDM elements, especially the phase of the NOs; (3) symmetry-restricted functionals are constructed for the H4 geometries considered by Wang and Knowles, whose structure could serve as guide in the construction of approximate 1RDM functionals.

  "description": "Advanced fluorescence microscopy reveals disruption of dynamic CXCR4 dimerization by subpocket-specific inverse agonistsAlthough class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can function as monomers, many of them form dimers and oligomers, but the mechanisms and functional relevance of such oligomerization is ill understood. Here, we investigate this problem for the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), a GPCR that regulates immune and hematopoietic cell trafficking, and a major drug target in cancer therapy. We combine single-molecule microscopy and fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy to investigate CXCR4 membrane organization in living cells at densities ranging from a few molecules to hundreds of molecules per square micrometer of the plasma membrane. We observe that CXCR4 forms dynamic, transient homodimers, and that the monomer-dimer equilibrium is governed by receptor density. CXCR4 inverse agonists that bind to the receptor minor pocket inhibit CXCR4 constitutive activity and abolish receptor dimerization. A mutation in the minor binding pocket reduced the dimer-disrupting ability of these ligands. In addition, mutating critical residues in the sixth transmembrane helix of CXCR4 markedly diminished both basal activity and dimerization, supporting the notion that CXCR4 basal activity is required for dimer formation. Together, these results link CXCR4 dimerization to its density and to its activity. They further suggest that inverse agonists binding to the minor pocket suppress both dimerization and constitutive activity and may represent a specific strategy to target CXCR4."

  "description": "Searching for principles of microbial physiologyWhy do evolutionarily distinct microorganisms display similar physiological behaviours? Why are transitions from high-ATP yield to low(er)-ATP yield metabolisms so widespread across species? Why is fast growth generally accompanied with low stress tolerance? Do these regularities occur because most microbial species are subject to the same selective pressures and physicochemical constraints? If so, a broadly-applicable theory might be developed that predicts common microbiological behaviours. Microbial systems biologists have been working out the contours of this theory for the last two decades, guided by experimental data. At its foundations lie basic principles from evolutionary biology, enzyme biochemistry, metabolism, cell composition and steady-state growth. The theory makes predictions about fitness costs and benefits of protein expression, physicochemical constraints on cell growth and characteristics of optimal metabolisms that maximise growth rate. Comparisons of the theory with experimental data indicates that microorganisms often aim for maximisation of growth rate, also in the presence of stresses; they often express optimal metabolisms and metabolic proteins at optimal concentrations. This review explains the current status of the theory for microbiologists; its roots, predictions, experimental evidence and future directions."

An individual correlon is characterized with a one-particle wave function, the imaginary part of which (or covalent correlon) gives the amplitude of the on-top depletion of the (conditional electron) charge (ODC) due to (strong) electron correlation. In its turn, the real part (ionic correlon) gives the amplitude of the on-top accumulation of the (electron) charge (OAC) due to the ionic squeezing of electrons. The proposed correlon theory is applied to analyze the local correlation effects in the ground and first excited states of the hydrogen molecule as well as of the equidistant and alternate linear hydrogen chains from H4 to H12. The covalent and ionic correlons obtained at the multiconfigurational self-consistent-field level of correlated functions are demonstrated to be the robust descriptors of the covalency of the ground and the ionicity of the excited Hn states.

An analogue by catalogue approach and detailed kinetic analysis identified improved compounds that behaved as nonessential activators with up to a 2-fold increase in maximum activation. The compounds did not activate the related bacterial glycoside hydrolase CcBglA demonstrating specificity. Interestingly, an analogue of the initial fragment inhibits both TrBgl2 and CcBglA, apparently through a mixed-model mechanism. Although it was not possible to determine crystal structures of activator binding to 55\u2005kDa TrBgl2, solution NMR experiments demonstrated a specific binding site for the activator. A partial assignment of the NMR spectrum gave the identity of the amino acids at this site, allowing a model for TrBgl2 activation to be built. The activator binds at the entrance of the substrate-binding site, generating a productive conformation for the enzyme-substrate complex."

  "description": "The Hydrogenation Problem in Cobalt-based Catalytic HydroaminomethylationThe hydroaminomethylation (HAM) reaction converts alkenes into N-alkylated amines and has been well studied for rhodium- and ruthenium-based catalytic systems. Cobalt-based catalytic systems are able to perform the essential hydroformylation reaction, but are also known to form very active hydrogenation catalysts, therefore we examined such a system for its potential use in the HAM reaction. Thus, we have quantum-chemically explored the hydrogenation activity of [HCo(CO)3] in model reactions with ethene, methyleneamine, formaldehyde, and vinylamine using dispersion-corrected relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-BLYP-D3(BJ)/TZ2P. Our computations reveal essentially identical overall barriers for the catalytic hydrogenation of ethene, formaldehyde, and vinylamine. This strongly suggests that a cobalt-based catalytic system will lack hydrogenation selectivity in experimental HAM reactions. Our HAM experiments with a cobalt-based catalytic system (consisting of Co2(CO)8 as cobalt source and P(n-Bu)3 as ligand) resulted in the formation of the desired N-alkylated amine. However, significant amounts of hydrogenated starting material as well as alcohol (hydrogenated aldehyde) were always formed. The use of cobalt-based catalysts in the HAM reaction to selectively form N-alkylated amines seems therefore not feasible. This confirms our computational prediction and highlights the usefulness of state-of-the-art DFT computations for guiding future experiments."

  "description": "A review of bottom-up and top-down emission estimates of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in different parts of the worldHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are widespread alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. They are used mainly as refrigerants or as foam-blowing agents. HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer, but they are very potent greenhouse gases, already contributing to global warming. Since 2019 HFCs are regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which demands reliable emission estimates to monitor the phase-down. Quantification of emissions is performed with two methods: bottom-up from product inventories or data on chemical sales; or top-down, inferred from atmospheric measurements by inverse modelling or interspecies correlation. Here, we review and compare the two methods and give an overview of HFC emissions from different parts of the world. Emission estimates reported by the different methods vary considerably. HFC emissions of developed countries (Annex I) are reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These bottom-up estimates add up to only half of global emissions estimated from atmospheric data. Several studies with regional top-down estimates have shown that this gap is not owed to large-scale underreporting of emissions from developed countries, but mostly due to emissions from developing countries (non-Annex I). China accounts for a large fraction of the emissions causing the gap, but not entirely. Bottom-up and top-down estimations of emissions from other developing countries that could identify other large emitters are largely unavailable. Especially South America, West-, Central- and East-Africa, India, the Arabian Peninsula and Northern Australia are not well covered by measurement stations that could provide atmospheric data for top-down estimates."

  "description": "Steering microbiomes by organic amendments towards climate-smart agricultural soilsWe steered the soil microbiome via applications of organic residues (mix of cover crop residues, sewage sludge + compost, and digestate + compost) to enhance multiple ecosystem services in line with climate-smart agriculture. Our result highlights the potential to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils by the application of specific organic amendments (especially digestate + compost). Unexpectedly, also the addition of mineral fertilizer in our mesocosms led to similar combined GHG emissions than one of the specific organic amendments. However, the application of organic amendments has the potential to increase soil C, which is not the case when using mineral fertilizer. While GHG emissions from cover crop residues were significantly higher compared to mineral fertilizer and the other organic amendments, crop growth was promoted. Furthermore, all organic amendments induced a shift in the diversity and abundances of key microbial groups. We show that organic amendments have the potential to not only lower GHG emissions by modifying the microbial community abundance and composition, but also favour crop growth-promoting microorganisms. This modulation of the microbial community by organic amendments bears the potential to turn soils into more climate-smart soils in comparison to the more conventional use of mineral fertilizers."

  "description": "Cross platform solutions to improve the zebrafish polar metabolome coverage using LC-QTOF MS: Optimization of separation mechanisms, solvent additives, and resuspension solventsUntargeted metabolomics has been widely used for studies with zebrafish embryos. Until now, the number of analytical approaches to determine metabolites in zebrafish is limited, and there is a lack of consensus on the best platforms for comprehensive metabolomics analysis of zebrafish embryos. In addition, the capacity of these methods to detect metabolites is unsatisfactory and the confidence level for identifying compounds is relatively low. To improve the metabolome coverage, we mainly focused on the optimization of separation mechanisms, mobile phase additives, and resuspension solvents based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupling to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) techniques. Moreover, the procedures for optimizing methods were assessed when taking metabolite profiles in both positive and negative ionization modes into account. Four LC columns were studied: C18, T3, PFP, and HILIC. In positive ionization mode, it was strongly recommended to employ the HILIC approach operated at the neutral condition, which led to the presence of more than 4700 features and the annotation of 151 metabolites, mainly zwitterionic and basic compounds, in comparison to reverse phase (RP)-based methods with less than 1000 features. In negative ionization mode, the PFP column operated at 0.02% acetic acid showed the best performance in terms of metabolite coverage: 3100 metabolic features were detected and 218 metabolites were annotated in zebrafish embryos. Metabolite profiles mainly contained acidic and zwitterionic compounds. HILIC-based platforms were complementary to RP columns when analyzing highly polar metabolites. Additionally, it was preferable to reconstitute zebrafish extracts in 100% water for analysis of metabolites on RP columns, with a 20\u201330% increase in the number of identified metabolites compared to a 50% water in methanol solution. However, water/methanol (1:9, v/v), as resuspension solution, was advantageous over water/methanol (1:1, v/v) for HILIC analysis showing an 8\u201315% increase in detected metabolites. In total 336 polar metabolites were annotated by the combination of the optimized HILIC (positive) and PFP (negative) approaches. The largest metabolome coverage of polar metabolites in zebrafish embryos was obtained when three approaches were combined (negative PFP and HILIC, and HILIC positive) resulting in more than 420 annotated compounds."

Under net reductive conditions using commercial Hantzsch ester, the \u03b1-amino radical species underwent a single stereoselective cyclisation to give trans-configured amino-indane structures in good yield, whereas using a substituted Hantzsch ester as a milder reductant afforded cis-fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline frameworks, resulting from two consecutive radical cyclisations. Judicious choice of the reaction conditions allowed libraries of both single and dual cyclisation products to be synthesised with high selectivity, notable predictability, and good-to-excellent yields. Computational analysis employing DFT revealed the reaction pathway and mechanistic rationale behind this finely balanced yet readily controlled photocatalytic system."

  "description": "Plasmid Complement of Lactococcus lactis NCDO712 Reveals a Novel Pilus Gene ClusterLactococcus lactis MG1363 is an important gram-positive model organism. It is a plasmid-free and phage-cured derivative of strain NCDO712. Plasmid-cured strains facilitate studies on molecular biological aspects, but many properties which make L. lactis an important organism in the dairy industry are plasmid encoded. We sequenced the total DNA of strain NCDO712 and, contrary to earlier reports, revealed that the strain carries 6 rather than 5 plasmids. A new 50-kb plasmid, designated pNZ712, encodes functional nisin immunity (nisCIP) and copper resistance (lcoRSABC). The copper resistance could be used as a marker for the conjugation of pNZ712 to L. lactis MG1614. A genome comparison with the plasmid cured daughter strain MG1363 showed that the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms that accumulated in the laboratory since the strains diverted more than 30 years ago is limited to 11 of which only 5 lead to amino acid changes. The 16-kb plasmid pSH74 was found to contain a novel 8-kb pilus gene cluster spaCB-spaA-srtC1-srtC2, which is predicted to encode a pilin tip protein SpaC, a pilus basal subunit SpaB, and a pilus backbone protein SpaA. The sortases SrtC1/SrtC2 are most likely involved in pilus polymerization while the chromosomally encoded SrtA could act to anchor the pilus to peptidoglycan in the cell wall. Overexpression of the pilus gene cluster from a multi-copy plasmid in L. lactis MG1363 resulted in cell chaining, aggregation, rapid sedimentation and increased conjugation efficiency of the cells. Electron microscopy showed that the over-expression of the pilus gene cluster leads to appendices on the cell surfaces. A deletion of the gene encoding the putative basal protein spaB, by truncating spaCB, led to more pilus-like structures on the cell surface, but cell aggregation and cell chaining were no longer observed. This is consistent with the prediction that spaB is involved in the anchoring of the pili to the cell."

  "description": "Cell envelope stress in mycobacteria is regulated by the novel signal transduction ATPase IniR in response to trehaloseThe cell envelope of mycobacteria is a highly unique and complex structure that is functionally equivalent to that of Gram-negative bacteria to protect the bacterial cell. Defects in the integrity or assembly of this cell envelope must be sensed to allow the induction of stress response systems. The promoter that is specifically and most strongly induced upon exposure to ethambutol and isoniazid, first line drugs that affect cell envelope biogenesis, is the iniBAC promoter. In this study, we set out to identify the regulator of the iniBAC operon in Mycobacterium marinum using an unbiased transposon mutagenesis screen in a constitutively iniBAC-expressing mutant background. We obtained multiple mutants in the mce1 locus as well as mutants in an uncharacterized putative transcriptional regulator (MMAR_0612). This latter gene was shown to function as the iniBAC regulator, as overexpression resulted in constitutive iniBAC induction, whereas a knockout mutant was unable to respond to the presence of ethambutol and isoniazid. Experiments with the M. tuberculosis homologue (Rv0339c) showed identical results. RNAseq experiments showed that this regulatory gene was exclusively involved in the regulation of the iniBAC operon. We therefore propose to name this dedicated regulator iniBAC Regulator (IniR). IniR belongs to the family of signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains, including a putative sugar-binding domain. Upon testing different sugars, we identified trehalose as an activator and metabolic cue for iniBAC activation, which could also explain the effect of the mce1 mutations. In conclusion, cell envelope stress in mycobacteria is regulated by IniR in a cascade that includes trehalose."

  "description": "Multipurpose HTS Coagulation Analysis: Assay Development and Assessment of Coagulopathic Snake VenomsCoagulation assays currently employed are often low throughput, require specialized equipment and/or require large blood/plasma samples. This study describes the development, optimization and early application of a generic low-volume and high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for coagulation activity. The assay is a time-course spectrophotometric measurement which kinetically measures the clotting profile of bovine or human plasma incubated with Ca2+ and a test compound. The HTS assay can be a valuable new tool for coagulation diagnostics in hospitals, for research in coagulation disorders, for drug discovery and for venom research. A major effect following envenomation by many venomous snakes is perturbation of blood coagulation caused by haemotoxic compounds present in the venom. These compounds, such as anticoagulants, are potential leads in drug discovery for cardiovascular diseases. The assay was implemented in an integrated analytical approach consisting of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) for separation of crude venom components in combination with parallel post-column coagulation screening and mass spectrometry (MS). The approach was applied for the rapid assessment and identification of profiles of haemotoxic compounds in snake venoms. Procoagulant and anticoagulant activities were correlated with accurate masses from the parallel MS measurements, facilitating the detection of peptides showing strong anticoagulant activity."

The paper combined literature on frames with literature on meat consumption. It showed that meat eating was connected to the frames that guide consumer choices through sensory-based associations (savory, satisfying) and conceptual interpretations of meals and social situations. It also showed that the science-based health and sustainability arguments in favor of a diet change do not sufficiently reach consumers or are too difficult for them to comprehend. To reach consumers, therefore, it is crucial to develop bridging frames that work as push factors away from routine meat eating, or pull factors that encourage the consumption of primarily plant-based protein and special meat types. These frames (recipes, point-of-sale information) should build on the familiar culinary principles of variety, balance, and moderation, offer a moderate amount of novelty, and enable consumers to make positive sensory associations and coherent interpretations of healthy and sustainable protein dishes. A potential limitation of a frame-based approach is that it requires much attention to detail and context."

  "description": "Effects of growth rate and promoter activity on single-cell protein expressionProtein expression in a single cell depends on its global physiological state. Moreover, genetically-identical cells exhibit variability (noise) in protein expression, arising from the stochastic nature of biochemical processes, cell growth and division. While it is well understood how cellular growth rate influences mean protein expression, little is known about the relationship between growth rate and noise in protein expression. Here we quantify this relationship in Bacillus subtilis by a novel combination of experiments and theory. We measure the effects of promoter activity and growth rate on the expression of a fluorescent protein in single cells. We disentangle the observed protein expression noise into protein-specific and systemic contributions, using theory and variance decomposition. We find that noise in protein expression depends solely on mean expression levels, regardless of whether expression is set by promoter activity or growth rate, and that noise increases linearly with growth rate. Our results can aid studies of (synthetic) gene circuits of single cells and their condition dependence."

  "description": "European demonstration program on the effect-based and chemical identification and monitoring of organic pollutants in European surface watersGrowing concern about the adverse environmental and human health effects of a wide range of micropollutants requires the development of novel tools and approaches to enable holistic monitoring of their occurrence, fate and effects in the aquatic environment. A European-wide demonstration program (EDP) for effect-based monitoring of micropollutants in surface waters was carried out within the Marie Curie Initial Training Network EDA-EMERGE. The main objectives of the EDP were to apply a simplified protocol for effect-directed analysis, to link biological effects to target compounds and to estimate their risk to aquatic biota. Onsite large volume solid phase extraction of 50 L of surface water was performed at 18 sampling sites in four European river basins. Extracts were subjected to effect-based analysis (toxicity to algae, fish embryo toxicity, neurotoxicity, (anti-)estrogenicity, (anti-)androgenicity, glucocorticoid activity and thyroid activity), to target analysis (151 organic micropollutants) and to nontarget screening. The most pronounced effects were estrogenicity, toxicity to algae and fish embryo toxicity. In most bioassays, major portions of the observed effects could not be explained by target compounds, especially in case of androgenicity, glucocorticoid activity and fish embryo toxicity. Estrone and nonylphenoxyacetic acid were identified as the strongest contributors to estrogenicity, while herbicides, with a minor contribution from other micropollutants, were linked to the observed toxicity to algae. Fipronil and nonylphenol were partially responsible for the fish embryo toxicity. Within the EDP, 21 target compounds were prioritized on the basis of their frequency and extent of exceedance of predicted no effect concentrations. The EDP priority list included 6 compounds, which are already addressed by European legislation, and 15 micropollutants that may be important for future monitoring of surface waters. The study presents a novel simplified protocol for effect-based monitoring and draws a comprehensive picture of the surface water status across Europe."

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the structural, biochemical, and pharmacological data on class B GPCRs for understanding ligand\u2013receptor interaction and modulation mechanisms and assessing the potential implications for drug discovery for the secretin-like GPCR family. Methodological developments in X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy have enabled the determination of the first full-length and G protein-coupled structures of class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Structural comparison of different class B GPCR\u2013ligand complexes provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of receptor activation, including: (i) ligand-induced conformational changes of extracellular and transmembrane domains; (ii) intramolecular interaction networks facilitating G protein coupling; and (iii) negative and positive allosteric modulation of receptor activation. The new structures of class B GPCRs reveal novel allosteric binding sites. The structural details of the binding modes of negative and positive allosteric modulators provide new templates for structure-based drug discovery for this pharmaceutically relevant receptor family."

  "description": "Improved androgen specificity of AR-EcoScreen by CRISPR based glucocorticoid receptor knockoutThe AR-EcoScreen is a widely used reporter assay for the detection of androgens and anti-androgens. Endogenous expression of glucocorticoid receptors and their affinity for the androgen responsive element that drives reporter expression, however, makes the reporter cells sensitive to interference by glucocorticoids and less specific for (anti-)androgens. To create a glucocorticoid insensitive derivative of the AR-EcoScreen, CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing was used to develop glucocorticoid receptor knockout mutants by targeting various sites in the glucocorticoid gene. Two mutant cell lines were further characterized and validated against the unmodified AR-EcoScreen with a set of 19 environmentally relevant chemicals and a series of environmental passive sampler extracts with (anti-)androgenic activity. Sequencing of the targeted sites revealed premature stop codons following frame-shift mutations, leading to an absence of functional glucocorticoid receptor expression. The introduced mutations rendered cell lines insensitive to glucocorticoid activation and caused no significant difference in the responsiveness towards (anti-)androgens, compared to the unmodified AR-EcoScreen cells, allowing the selective, GR-independent, determination of (anti-)androgenicity in environmental passive sampler extracts. The increase in selectivity for (anti-)androgens improves reliability of the AR-EcoScreen and will provide higher accuracy in determining (anti-)androgenic potential when applied in toxicity screening and environmental monitoring of both single compounds and mixtures."

  "description": "Statistics and simulation of growth of single bacterial cells: Illustrations with B. subtilis and E. coliThe inherent stochasticity of molecular reactions prevents us from predicting the exact state of single-cells in a population. However, when a population grows at steady-state, the probability to observe a cell with particular combinations of properties is fixed. Here we validate and exploit existing theory on the statistics of single-cell growth in order to predict the probability of phenotypic characteristics such as cell-cycle times, volumes, accuracy of division and cell-age distributions, using real-time imaging data for Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli. Our results show that single-cell growth-statistics can accurately be predicted from a few basic measurements. These equations relate different phenotypic characteristics, and can therefore be used in consistency tests of experimental single-cell growth data and prediction of single-cell statistics. We also exploit these statistical relations in the development of a fast stochastic-simulation algorithm of single-cell growth and protein expression. This algorithm greatly reduces computational burden, by recovering the statistics of growing cell-populations from the simulation of only one of its lineages. Our approach is validated by comparison of simulations and experimental data. This work illustrates a methodology for the prediction, analysis and tests of consistency of single-cell growth and protein expression data from a few basic statistical principles."

  "description": "Towards optimisation of induced pluripotent cell culture: Extracellular acidification results in growth arrest of iPSC prior to nutrient exhaustionHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) have the potential to radically reduce the number of animals used in both toxicological science and disease elucidation. One initial obstacle culturing iPSC is that they require daily medium exchange. This study attempts to clarify why and propose some practical solutions. Two iPSC lineages were fed at different intervals in a full growth area (FGA) or a restricted growth area (RGA). The FGA consisted of a well coated with Matrigel\u2122 and the RGA consisted of a coated coverslip placed in a well. Glucose, lactate, extracellular pH and cell cycle phases were quantified. Without daily feeding, FGA cultured iPSC had significantly reduced growth rates by day 2 and began to die by day 3. In contrast, RGA cultured cells grew to confluence over 3 days. Surprisingly, glucose was not exhausted under any condition. However, extracellular pH reached 6.8 after 72 h in FGA cultures. Artificially reducing medium pH to 6.8 also inhibited glycolysis and initiated an increase in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, while adding an additional 10 mM bicarbonate to the medium increased glycolysis rates. This study demonstrates that iPSC are highly sensitive to extracellular acidification, a likely limiting factor in maintenance of proliferative and pluripotent status. Culturing iPSC in RGA prevents rapid extracellular acidification, while still maintaining pluripotency and allowing longer feeding cycles."

  "description": "Latency-Associated Expression of Human Cytomegalovirus US28 Attenuates Cell Signaling Pathways To Maintain Latent InfectionReactivation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) latent infection from early myeloid lineage cells constitutes a threat to immunocompromised or immune-suppressed individuals. Consequently, understanding the control of latency and reactivation to allow targeting and killing of latently infected cells could have far-reaching clinical benefits. US28 is one of the few viral genes that is expressed during latency and encodes a cell surface G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which, during lytic infection, is a constitutive cell-signaling activator. Here we now show that in monocytes, which are recognized sites of HCMV latency in vivo, US28 attenuates multiple cell signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and NF-\u03baB, and that this is required to establish a latent infection; viruses deleted for US28 initiate a lytic infection in infected monocytes. We also show that these monocytes then become potent targets for the HCMV-specific host immune response and that latently infected cells treated with an inverse agonist of US28 also reactivate lytic infection and similarly become immune targets. Consequently, we suggest that the use of inhibitors of US28 could be a novel immunotherapeutic strategy to reactivate the latent viral reservoir, allowing it to be targeted by preexisting HCMV-specific T cells.IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpesvirus and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among immunosuppressed individuals. HCMV can establish latent infection, where the viral genome is maintained in an infected cell, without production of infectious virus. A number of genes, including US28, are expressed by HCMV during latent infection. US28 has been shown to activate many cellular signaling pathways during lytic infection, promoting lytic gene expression and virus production. As such, the role of US28 remains unclear and seems at odds with latency. Here, we show that US28 has the opposite phenotype in cells that support latent infection-it attenuates cellular signaling, thereby maintaining latency. Inhibition of US28 with a small-molecule inhibitor causes HCMV latent infection to reactivate, allowing latently infected cells to be detected and killed by the immune system. This approach could be used to treat latent HCMV to clear it from human transplants."

  "description": "The practice of prediction: What can ecologists learn from applied, ecology-related fields?The pervasive influence of human induced global environmental change affects biodiversity across the globe, and there is great uncertainty as to how the biosphere will react on short and longer time scales. To adapt to what the future holds and to manage the impacts of global change, scientists need to predict theexpected effects with some confidence and communicate these predictions to policy makers. However, recent reviews found that we currently lack a clear understanding of how predictable ecology is, with views seeing it as mostly unpredictable to potentially predictable, at least over short time frames. However, in applied, ecology-related fields predictions are more commonly formulated and reported, as well as evaluated in hindsight, potentially allowing one to define baselines of predictive proficiency in these fields. We searched the literature for representative case studies in these fields and collectedinformation about modeling approaches, target variables of prediction, predictive proficiency achieved, as well as the availability of data to parameterize predictive models. We find that some fields such as epidemiology achieve high predictive proficiency, but even in the more predictive fields proficiency isevaluated in different ways. Both phenomenological and mechanistic approaches are used in most fields, but differences are often small, with no clear superiority of one approach over the other. Data availability is limiting in most fields, with long-term studies being rare and detailed data for parameterizing mechanistic models being in short supply. We suggest that ecologists adopt a more rigorous approach to report and assess predictive proficiency, and embrace the challenges of real world decision making to strengthen the practice of prediction in ecology."

Despite several efforts for its functional characterization, CYP130 is still considered an orphan enzyme for which no endogenous or exogenous substrate has been identified. In addition, functional redox-partners for CYP130 have not been clearly established yet, hampering the elucidation of its physiological role. In the present study, a catalytically active fusion protein involving CYP130 and the NADPH reductase-domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium was created. By screening a panel of known substrates of human P450s, dextromethorphan N-demethylation was identified as a reaction catalyzed by CYP130. The fusion enzyme showed higher catalytic activity, when compared to CYP130 reconstituted with a selection of non-native redox-partners. Molecular dynamics simulation studies based on the crystal structure of CYP130 revealed two primary docking poses of dextromethorphan within the active site consistent with the experimentally observed N-demethylation reaction during the entire molecular dynamics simulation. The dextromethorphan N-demethylation reaction was strongly inhibited by azole-drugs and maybe applied to identify mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP130. Furthermore, the present active CYP130-fusion protein may facilitate the identification of endogenous substrates from Mtb."

  "description": "Using a specific RNA-protein interaction to quench the fluorescent RNA SpinachRNAs are involved in interaction networks with other biomolecules and are crucial for proper cell function. Yet, their biochemical analysis remains challenging. For F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), a common tool to study such interaction networks, two interacting molecules have to be fluorescently labelled. 'Spinach' is a genetically encodable RNA aptamer, which starts to fluoresce upon binding of an organic molecule. Therefore, it is a biological fluorophore tag for RNAs. However, spinach has never been used in a FRET assembly before. Here, we describe how spinach is quenched when close to acceptors. We used RNA-DNA hybridization to bring quenchers or red organic dyes in close proximity to spinach. Furthermore, we investigate RNA-protein interactions quantitatively on the example of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage coat protein 7 (PP7) and its interacting pp7-RNA. We utilize spinach quenching as a fully genetically encodable system even under lysate conditions. Therefore, this work represents a direct method to analyse RNA-protein interactions by quenching the spinach aptamer."

We used social defeat-induced persistent stress (SDPS) to induce a depressive-like state in rats and then studied long-lasting memory deficits in the absence of acute stressors in these animals. The SDPS rat model showed reduced short-term object location memory and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons of the dorsal hippocampus. SDPS animals displayed increased expression of synaptic chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the dorsal hippocampus. These effects were abrogated by a 3-week treatment with the antidepressant imipramine starting 8 weeks after the last defeat encounter. Next, we observed an increase in the number of perineuronal nets (PNNs) surrounding parvalbumin-expressing interneurons and a decrease in the frequency of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in the hippocampal CA1 region in SDPS animals. In vivo breakdown of the hippocampus CA1 extracellular matrix by the enzyme chondroitinase ABC administered intracranially restored the number of PNNs, LTP maintenance, hippocampal inhibitory tone, and memory performance on the object place recognition test. Our data reveal a causal link between increased hippocampal extracellular matrix and the cognitive deficits associated with a chronic depressive-like state in rats exposed to SDPS."

  "description": "The RNA-Binding Protein hnRNP K Mediates the Effect of BDNF on Dendritic mRNA Metabolism and Regulates Synaptic NMDA Receptors in Hippocampal NeuronsBrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important mediator of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. The local effects of BDNF depend on the activation of translation activity, which requires the delivery of transcripts to the synapse. In this work, we found that neuronal activity regulates the dendritic localization of the RNA-binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) in cultured rat hippocampal neurons by stimulating BDNF-Trk signaling. Microarray experiments identified a large number of transcripts that are coimmunoprecipitated with hnRNP K, and about 60% of these transcripts are dissociated from the protein upon stimulation of rat hippocampal neurons with BDNF.In vivostudies also showed a role for TrkB signaling in the dissociation of transcripts from hnRNP K upon high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of medial perforant path-granule cell synapses of male rat dentate gyrus (DG). Furthermore, treatment of rat hippocampal synaptoneurosomes with BDNF decreased the coimmunoprecipitation of hnRNP K with mRNAs coding for glutamate receptor subunits, Ca2+- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II\u03b2 (CaMKII\u03b2) and BDNF. Downregulation of hnRNP K impaired the BDNF-induced enhancement of NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated mEPSC, and similar results were obtained upon inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide. The results demonstrate that BDNF regulates specific populations of hnRNP-associated mRNAs in neuronal dendrites and suggests an important role of hnRNP K in BDNF-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity."

In particular, two powerful analytical tools are increasingly used by analytical scientists, namely online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LC \u00d7 LC, having a second-dimension separation in the liquid phase) and liquid chromatography-ion mobility-spectrometry (LC-IMS, second dimension separation in the gas phase). The goal of the current study was a general assessment of the liquid-chromatography\u2013trapped-ion-mobility\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-TIMS\u2013MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC \u00d7 LC\u2013MS) platforms for untargeted lipid mapping in human plasma. For the first time trapped-ion-mobility spectrometry (TIMS) was employed for the separation of the major lipid classes and ion-mobility-derived collision-cross-section values were determined for a number of lipid standards. The general effects of a number of influencing parameters have been inspected and possible directions for improvements are discussed. We aimed to provide a general indication and practical guidelines for the analyst to choose an efficient multidimensional separation platform according to the particular requirements of the application. Analysis time, orthogonality, peak capacity, and an indicative measure for the resolving power are discussed as main characteristics for multidimensional separation systems."

  "description": "Effects of environmental pollutants on calcium release and uptake by rat cortical microsomesDysregulation of neuronal intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis can play a crucial role in many neurotoxic effects, including impaired brain development and behavioral dysfunctions. This study examined 40 suspected neurotoxicants from different chemical classes for their capacity to alter Ca2+ release and uptake from rat cortical microsomes. First, ten suspected neurotoxicants have been tested using a well-established cuvette-based Ca2+ flux assay. Five out of ten compounds (TOCP, endosulfan, PCB-95, chlorpyrifos and BDE-49) showed a significant, concentration-dependent alteration of Ca2+ release and uptake in adult rat cortical microsomes. The original cuvette assay was downscaled and customized to a fast, higher throughput microplate method and the 40 suspected neurotoxicants were screened for their effects on intracellular Ca2+homeostasis. In decreasing order of potency, the 15 test compounds that showed the strongest alteration of Ca2+ levels in adult rat microsomes were TOCP, endosulfan, BDE-49, 6-OH-BDE-47, PCB-95, permethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, bioallethrin, cypermethrin, RDP, DEHP, DBP, BDE-47, and PFOS. Results from co-exposure experiments with selective inhibitors suggested that for some compounds Ca2+ releasing effects could be attributed to RyR activation (PFOS, DBP, and DEHP) or to SERCA inhibition (a potential novel mechanism of action for all four tested pyrethroid insecticides). The effects of the two most potent compounds, endosulfan and TOCP, were not blocked by any of the inhibitors tested, indicating other possible mechanism of action. For all other potent test compounds, a combined effect on RyR, IP3R, and/or SERCA has been observed. PFOS and 6-OH-BDE-47 caused increased Ca2+ release from adult but not from neonatal rat brain microsomes, indicating age-dependent difference in susceptibility to these test compounds. The current study suggests that the neurotoxic potential of compounds belonging to different chemical classes could partly be attributed to the effects on intracellular Ca2+ release and uptake. Although further validation is required, the downscaled method developed in this study presents technical advance that could be used for the future screening of suspected intracellular Ca2+ disruptors."

  "description": "Factors Controlling the Diels\u2013Alder Reactivity of Hetero-1,3-ButadienesWe have quantum chemically explored the Diels\u2013Alder reactivities of a systematic series of hetero-1,3-butadienes with ethylene by using density functional theory at the BP86/TZ2P level. Activation strain analyses provided physical insight into the factors controlling the relative cycloaddition reactivity of aza- and oxa-1,3-butadienes. We find that dienes with a terminal heteroatom, such as 2-propen-1-imine (NCCC) or acrolein (OCCC), are less reactive than the archetypal 1,3-butadiene (CCCC), primarily owing to weaker orbital interactions between the more electronegative heteroatoms with ethylene. Thus, the addition of a second heteroatom at the other terminal position (NCCN and OCCO) further reduces the reactivity. However, the introduction of a nitrogen atom in the backbone (CNCC) leads to enhanced reactivity, owing to less Pauli repulsion resulting from polarization of the diene HOMO in CNCC towards the nitrogen atom and away from the terminal carbon atom. The Diels\u2013Alder reactions of ethenyl-diazene (NNCC) and 1,3-diaza-butadiene (NCNC), which contain heteroatoms at both the terminal and backbone positions, are much more reactive due to less activation strain compared to CCCC."

  "description": "Local and global interpolations along the adiabatic connection of DFT: a study at different correlation regimesInterpolating the exchange\u2013correlation energy along the density-fixed adiabatic connection of density functional theory is a promising way to build approximations that are not biased toward the weakly correlated regime. These interpolations can be performed at the global (integrated over all spaces) or at the local level, using energy densities. Many features of the relevant energy densities as well as several different ways to construct these interpolations, including comparisons between global and local variants, are investigated here for the analytically solvable Hooke\u2019s atom series, which allows for an exploration of different correlation regimes. We also analyze different ways to define the correlation kinetic energy density, focusing on the peak in the kinetic correlation potential."

The formation of V6 metabolites was catalyzed by several enzymes, especially rCYP1A2 that was responsible for the exclusive formation of two metabolites, one primary (M1) and its secondary metabolite (M9). For BDP, only one phase I metabolite (MM1) was catalyzed by the seven rCYPs. Collectively, these results indicate that CYPs have a predominant role in the metabolism of V6, while PONs have a predominant role in BDP in vitro metabolism. These results are a starting point for future studies involving the study of the toxicity, bioaccumulation and in vivo biomonitoring of V6 and BDP."

  "description": "Nanobody-Fc constructs targeting chemokine receptor CXCR4 potently inhibit signaling and CXCR4-mediated HIV-entry and induce antibody effector functionsUpregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 contributes to the progression and metastasis of both solid and hematological malignancies, rendering this receptor an attractive therapeutic target. Besides the only FDA-approved CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor (AMD3100), multiple other classes of CXCR4-targeting molecules are under (pre-)clinical development. Nanobodies (Nb), small single variable domains of heavy-chain only antibodies from Camelids, have appeared to be ideal antibody-fragments for targeting a broad range of epitopes and cavities within GPCRs such as CXCR4. Compared to conventional antibodies, monovalent nanobodies show fast blood clearance and no effector functions. In order to further increase their binding affinities and to restore antibody-mediated effector functions, we have constructed three different bivalent nanobody Fc-fusion molecules (Nb-Fc), targeting distinct epitopes on CXCR4, via fusion of Nbs to a Fc domain of a human IgG1 antibody. Most Nb-Fc constructs show increased binding affinity and enhanced potency in CXCL12 displacement, inhibition of CXCL12-induced signaling and CXCR4-mediated HIV entry, when compared to their monovalent Nb counterparts. Moreover, Nb-Fc induced ADCC- and CDC-mediated cell-death of CXCR4-overexpressing CCRF-CEM leukemia cells and did not affect cells expressing low levels or no CXCR4. These highly potent CXCR4 Nb-Fc constructs with Fc-mediated effector functions are attractive molecules to therapeutically target CXCR4-overexpressing tumors."

  "description": "Time-Integrative Passive sampling combined with TOxicity Profiling (TIPTOP): an effect-based strategy for cost-effective chemical water quality assessmentThis study aimed at demonstrating that effect-based monitoring with passive sampling followed by toxicity profiling is more protective and cost-effective than the current chemical water quality assessment strategy consisting of compound-by-compound chemical analysis of selected substances in grab samples. Passive samplers were deployed in the Dutch river delta and in WWTP effluents. Their extracts were tested in a battery of bioassays and chemically analyzed to obtain toxicity and chemical profiles, respectively. Chemical concentrations in water were retrieved from publicly available databases. Seven different strategies were used to interpret the chemical and toxicity profiles in terms of ecological risk. They all indicated that the river sampling locations were relatively clean. Chemical-based monitoring resulted for many substances in measurements below detection limit and could only explain <20% of the observed in vitro toxicity. Effect-based monitoring yielded more informative conclusions as it allowed for ranking the sampling sites and for estimating a margin-of-exposure towards chronic effect ranges. Effect-based monitoring was also cheaper and more cost-effective (i.e. yielding more information per euro spent). Based on its identified strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT), a future strategy for effect-based monitoring has been proposed."

  "description": "Affinity profiling of monoclonal antibody and antibody-drug-conjugate preparations by coupled liquid chromatography-surface plasmon resonance biosensingMonoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are highly potent biopharmaceuticals designed for targeted cancer therapies. mAbs and ADCs can undergo modifications during production and storage which may affect binding to target receptors, potentially altering drug efficacy. In this work, liquid chromatography was coupled online to surface plasmon resonance (LC-SPR) to allow label-free affinity evaluation of mAb and ADC sample constituents (size and charge variants), under near-native conditions. Trastuzumab and its ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) were used as a test sample and were analyzed by aqueous size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)-SPR before and after exposure to aggregate-inducing conditions. SEC-SPR allowed separation of the formed aggregates and measurement of their affinity towards the ligand-binding domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor immobilized on the surface of the SPR sensor chip. The monomer and aggregates of the mAb and ADC were shown to have similar antigen affinity. Conjugation of drugs to trastuzumab appeared to accelerate the aggregate formation. In addition, cation-exchange chromatography (CEX) was coupled to SPR enabling monitoring the maximum ligand-analyte binding capacity (Rmax) of individual charge variants present in mAbs. Deamidated species and lysine variants in trastuzumab sample were separated but did not show different binding affinities to the immobilized HER2-binding domain. In order to allow protein variant assignment, parallel MS detection was added to the LC-SPR setup using a column effluent split. The feasibility of the LC-MS/SPR system was demonstrated by analysis of trastuzumab and T-DM1 providing information on antibody glycoforms and/or determination of the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR), while simultaneously monitoring binding of eluting species to HER2.

  "description": "CXCR4-targeting nanobodies differentially inhibit CXCR4 function and HIV entryThe chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand CXCL12 contribute to a variety of human diseases, such as cancer. CXCR4 is also a major co-receptor facilitating HIV entry. Accordingly, CXCR4 is considered as an attractive therapeutic target. Drug side effects and poor pharmacokinetic properties have been major hurdles that have prevented the implementation of CXCR4-directed inhibitors in treatment regimes. We evaluated the activity of a new and promising class of biologics, namely CXCR4-targeting nanobodies, with the purpose of identifying nanobodies that would preferentially inhibit HIV infection, while minimally disturbing other CXCR4-related functions. All CXCR4-interacting nanobodies inhibited CXCL12 binding and receptor-mediated calcium mobilization with comparable relative potencies. Importantly, the anti-HIV-1 activity of the nanobodies did not always correlate with their ability to modulate CXCR4 signaling and function, indicating that the anti-HIV and anti-CXCR4 activity are not entirely overlapping and may be functionally separated. Three nanobodies with divergent activity profiles (VUN400, VUN401 and VUN402) were selected for in depth biological evaluation. While all three nanobodies demonstrated inhibitory activity against a wide range of HIV (X4) strains, VUN402 poorly blocked CXCL12-induced CXCR4 internalization, chemotaxis and changes in cell morphology. Each of these nanobodies recognized distinct, although partially overlapping epitopes on CXCR4, which might underlie their distinct activity profiles. Our results demonstrate the potential of CXCR4-targeting nanobody VUN402 as a novel lead and starting point for the development of a more potent and selective anti-HIV agent."

The latter technology exploits the opportunities provided by the recently described bright bioluminescent protein NanoLuc when it is fused to the N-terminus of a receptor. Two different pharmacophores (mepyramine or the fragment VUF13816) were used to generate fluorescent H1R antagonists conjugated via peptide linkers to the fluorophore BODIPY630/650. Kinetic properties of the probes showed wide variation, with the VUF13816 analogues having much longer H1R residence times relative to their mepyramine-based counterparts. The kinetics of these fluorescent ligands could also be monitored in membrane preparations providing new opportunities for future drug discovery applications."

Evidence for GPCR oligomerisation has been accumulating that challenges the idea that GPCRs function solely as monomeric receptors; however, GPCR oligomerisation remains controversial primarily due to the difficulties in comparing evidence from very different types of structural and dynamic data. Using a combination of single-molecule and ensemble FRET, double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy, and simulations, we show that dimerisation of the GPCR neurotensin receptor 1 is regulated by receptor density and is dynamically tuneable over the physiological range. We propose a \"rolling dimer\" interface model in which multiple dimer conformations co-exist and interconvert. These findings unite previous seemingly conflicting observations, provide a compelling mechanism for regulating receptor signalling, and act as a guide for future physiological studies."

In this study, a real-time NanoBRET-based binding assay was established and validated to detect binding of unlabeled ligands to the histamine H3 receptor (H3R) and histamine H4 receptor on intact cells.

Hot-electron transfer could reduce these losses. Here, we demonstrate fast and efficient hot-electron transfer between lead selenide and cadmium selenide quantum dots assembled in a quantum-dot heterojunction solid. In this system, the energy structure of the absorber material and of the electron extracting material can be easily tuned via a variation of quantum-dot size, allowing us to tailor the energetics of the transfer process for device applications. The efficiency of the transfer process increases with excitation energy as a result of the more favorable competition between hot-electron transfer and electron cooling. The experimental picture is supported by time-domain density functional theory calculations, showing that electron density is transferred from lead selenide to cadmium selenide quantum dots on the sub-picosecond timescale."

Because typically only a specific spectral region is of experimental interest, we propose here an efficient method that allows calculation of only a selected frequency interval. After a computationally cheap low-level estimate of the molecular motions, the computational time is proportional to the number of normal modes needed to describe this frequency range. Results for a medium-sized molecule show a reduction in computational time of up to 1 order of magnitude with negligible loss in accuracy. We also show that still larger computational savings are possible by using an additional intensity-selection procedure."

  "description": "Shape-Pure, Nearly Monodispersed CsPbBr3 Nanocubes Prepared Using Secondary Aliphatic AminesFully inorganic cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3) nanocrystals (NCs) have been extensively studied due to their excellent optical properties, especially their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and the ease with which the PL can be tuned across the visible spectrum. So far, most strategies for synthesizing CsPbX3 NCs are highly sensitive to the processing conditions and ligand combinations. For example, in the synthesis of nanocubes of different sizes, it is not uncommon to have samples that contain various other shapes, such as nanoplatelets and nanosheets. Here, we report a new colloidal synthesis method for preparing shape-pure and nearly monodispersed CsPbBr3 nanocubes using secondary amines. Regardless of the length of the alkyl chains, the oleic acid concentration, and the reaction temperature, only cube-shaped NCs were obtained. The shape purity and narrow size distribution of the nanocubes are evident from their sharp excitonic features and their ease of self-assembly in superlattices, reaching lateral dimensions of up to 50 \u03bcm. We attribute this excellent shape and phase purity to the inability of secondary amines to find the right steric conditions at the surface of the NCs, which consequently limits the formation of low-dimensional structures. Furthermore, no contamination from other phases was observed, not even from Cs4PbBr6, presumably due to the poor ability of secondary aliphatic amines to coordinate to PbBr2 and, hence, to provide a reaction environment that is depleted in Pb."

  "description": "Use of Density Functional Based Tight Binding Methods in Vibrational Circular DichroismVibrational circular dichroism (VCD) is a spectroscopic technique used to resolve the absolute configuration of chiral systems. Obtaining a theoretical VCD spectrum requires computing atomic polar and axial tensors on top of the computationally demanding construction of the force constant matrix. In this study we evaluated a VCD model in which all necessary quantities are obtained with density functional based tight binding (DFTB) theory. The analyzed DFTB parametrizations fail at providing accurate vibrational frequencies and electric dipole gradients but yield reasonable normal modes at a fraction of the computational cost of density functional theory (DFT). Thus, by applying DFTB in composite methods along with DFT, we show that it is possible to obtain accurate VCD spectra at a much lower computational demand."

  "description": "An ecotoxicological view on neurotoxicity assessmentThe numbers of potential neurotoxicants in the environment are raising and pose a great risk for humans and the environment. Currently neurotoxicity assessment is mostly performed to predict and prevent harm to human populations. Despite all the efforts invested in the last years in developing novel in vitro or in silico test systems, in vivo tests with rodents are still the only accepted test for neurotoxicity risk assessment in Europe. Despite an increasing number of reports of species showing altered behaviour, neurotoxicity assessment for species in the environment is not required and therefore mostly not performed. Considering the increasing numbers of environmental contaminants with potential neurotoxic potential, eco-neurotoxicity should be also considered in risk assessment. In order to do so novel test systems are needed that can cope with species differences within ecosystems. In the field, online-biomonitoring systems using behavioural information could be used to detect neurotoxic effects and effect-directed analyses could be applied to identify the neurotoxicants causing the effect. Additionally, toxic pressure calculations in combination with mixture modelling could use environmental chemical monitoring data to predict adverse effects and prioritize pollutants for laboratory testing. Cheminformatics based on computational toxicological data from in vitro and in vivo studies could help to identify potential neurotoxicants. An array of in vitro assays covering different modes of action could be applied to screen compounds for neurotoxicity. The selection of in vitro assays could be guided by AOPs relevant for eco-neurotoxicity. In order to be able to perform risk assessment for eco-neurotoxicity, methods need to focus on the most sensitive species in an ecosystem. A test battery using species from different trophic levels might be the best approach. To implement eco-neurotoxicity assessment into European risk assessment, cheminformatics and in vitro screening tests could be used as first approach to identify eco-neurotoxic pollutants. In a second step, a small species test battery could be applied to assess the risks of ecosystems."

In this paper it is demonstrated that both local suppression of dynamic correlation (SDC) by nondynamic correlation and enhancement of dynamic correlation (EDC) due to excitation to a state of the ionic nature can be quantified with the ratio x(r) between the correlated and uncorrelated on-top pair densities \u03a0(r). A CAS\u03a0DFT scheme is proposed, in which Ecnd is calculated with the complete active space approach in a small basis, while Ecd is calculated in the same basis with a functional of density functional theory corrected for SDC and EDC with an original correction function of x(r). Correlation energies calculated with CAS\u03a0DFT along the bond-dissociation coordinate for the paradigmatic H2 and N2 molecules as well as for the C2 molecule with strong nondynamic correlation at the equilibrium agree well with the reference data, thus providing a proof of concept for CAS\u03a0DFT."

  "description": "Electronics, interior decoration and cleaning patterns affect flame retardant levels in the dust from Dutch residencesConsumer products such as furniture foam and electronic device casings are treated with flame retardant chemicals (FRs) to prevent the spread of fire. Many FRs are able to leach out of a product and end up in house dust. FRs in house dust can be taken up by humans through inhalation, ingestion or dermal adsorption. This study aims to identify factors in the home environment that are associated with FR levels in house dust. House dust and a wide range of data on characteristics of electronics, including age and use, interior decoration, domestic house and cleaning patterns, were collected from 50 households in the Netherlands. Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209) and several organophosphate flame retardants were measured in dust at detection percentages ranging from 58 to 94%, with median concentrations ranging from 32 ng/g (resorcinol-bis(diphenyl)phosphate (PBDPP)) to 825 ng/g (tris(chloropropyl)phosphate (TCIPP)). For the first time, age, hours of operation and use of the standby function of electronic devices were found to affect FR levels in dust. We found that if the total number of electronic devices purchased before 2008 increased by 1 device, BDE209 levels in house dust significantly increased by 66%. In addition, house dust from homes with carpeted floors was significantly associated with a 70\u201380% lower concentration of several FRs compared to homes with smooth floors (e.g., laminate). Less frequent vacuum cleaning and dusting were significantly associated with 41 to 88% higher concentrations of several FRs in dust. These associations suggest that actions such as frequent vacuum cleaning and dusting as well as different FR regulations for electronic devices affect indoor exposure levels."

Particularly, challenging is the study of actinide-based materials because of the electronic complexity of the actinide cations and to the hazards due to their radioactivity. Consequently, very few studies have been published in this subfield. In the present paper, we report a joint experimental-theoretical analysis of thorium tetrafluoride, ThF4, containing a closed-shell actinide (5f0) cation. Its crystalline structure has been revisited in the present work using powder neutron diffraction experiments. The 19F NMR parameters of the seven F crystallographic sites have been modeled using an empirical superposition model, periodic first-principles calculations, and a cluster-based all-electron approach. On the basis of the atomic position optimized structure, a complete and unambiguous assignment of the 19F NMR resonances to the F sites has been obtained."

Minimalistic model systems, such as coiled-coils, provide an excellent platform to improve this understanding and to construct novel molecular devices. Along those lines, we designed a conformational switch that is composed of two coiled-coil forming peptides and a central binding epitope. In the absence of a binding partner, this switch adopts a hairpin-like conformation that opens upon receptor binding. Variation of the coiled-coil length modulates the strength of the intramolecular constraint. The two conformational states of this switch have been linked with characteristic fluorescent properties, which enables the detection of the receptor in real-time."

  "description": "Fast, selective and quantitative protein profiling of adenovirus-vector based vaccines by ultra-performance liquid chromatographyA method for the quantitative determination of the protein composition of adenovirus-vector based vaccines was developed. The final method used RP-UPLC with UV absorbance detection, a C4 column (300 \u00c5, 1.7 \u03bcm, 2.1 \u00d7 150 mm), and a water- acetonitrile (ACN) gradient containing trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as ion-pairing agent. The chromatographic resolution between the various adenovirus proteins was optimized by studying the effect of the TFA concentration and the column temperature, applying a full factorial design of experiments. A reproducible baseline separation of all relevant adenovirus proteins could be achieved within 17 min run time. Samples containing adenovirus particles could be directly injected into the UPLC system without sample pretreatment. The viruses reproducibly dissociate into proteins in the UPLC system upon contact with the mobile phase containing ACN. The new RP-UPLC method was successfully validated for protein profiling and relative quantification of proteins in vaccine products based on adenovirus vector types 26 and 35. The intermediate precision of the relative peak areas of all proteins was between 1% and 14% RSD, except for the peak assigned to protein V (26% RSD). The method proved to be stability indicating with respect to thermal and oxidation stress of the adenovirus-vector based vaccine and was successfully implemented for the characterization of adenovirus-based products."

Using data from the China Enterprise Survey of the World Bank, empirical findings suggest that the influence of B-G ties on Chinese firms' product innovation is different in distinctive institutional contexts in China. More specifically, during institutional transition, B-G ties become less efficient for facilitating product innovation when regional legal institutions and infrastructural supporting systems in a region are more stable, fair, and efficient. By contrast, during institutional transition, a positive effect of B-G ties on firm product innovation in a region becomes more significant when financial systems are relatively advanced. In addition to this, the value of B-G ties for firm product innovation appears to be more stable when business regulation develops within subnational regions."

  "description": "Heterogeneity assessment of antibody-derived therapeutics at the intact and middle-up level by low-flow sheathless capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometryAntibody-based pharmaceuticals often encompass a complex structural heterogeneity requiring enhanced analytical methods for reliable characterization of variants and degradation products. We have explored the capabilities of low-flow sheathless capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) for the high-resolution and sensitive profiling of antibody therapeutics. Near-zero electroosmotic flow was achieved by employing a novel neutral capillary coating that also prevents protein adsorption. CE-MS analysis of intact model proteins using an acidic background electrolyte demonstrated satisfactory performance, with overall migration-time RSDs below 2.2% from three different capillaries tested. For system evaluation, three nanobody preparations, including mono- and bivalent forms, and three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were analyzed. Intact nanobodies were resolved from their degradation products, which could be assigned to deamidated, cleaved, and truncated forms at the C-terminal tag. Excellent resolution of isomeric deamidated products was obtained. The mAbs were analyzed intact and after digestion by the endoproteinase IdeS (middle-up approach). CE-MS of intact mAbs provided resolution of clipped species (e.g. light chain and light chain-heavy chain fragments) from the native protein. Moreover, glycoforms containing sialic acids were resolved from their non-sialylated counterparts. For IdeS-digested, F (ab)2 and Fc/2 portions where efficiently resolved for the three mAbs. Whereas the migration time of the Fc/2 fragments was fairly similar, the migration time of the F (ab)2 part was strongly varied among the mAbs. For all mAbs, separation of Fc/2 charge variants - including sialylated glycoforms and other post-translational modifications, such as loss of C-terminal lysine or asparagine deamidation - was achieved. This allowed a detailed and reliable assessment of the Fc/2 heterogeneity (18\u201333 proteoforms) of the three analyzed mAbs."

  "description": "Rapid forensic chemical classification of confiscated flash banger fireworks using capillary electrophoresisIn the Netherlands, the illegal use of powerful flash bangers is popular and as a result these items are frequently encountered in forensic casework. In collaboration with the Dutch police a representative sample set of the most frequently confiscated flash bangers, the Cobra 6 and Cobra 6 2G, has previously been collected also including imitation items. Classification of the different flash bangers was performed by analysing the pyrotechnic charge using capillary electrophoresis (CE) with indirect UV-detection. Two rapid CE methods were used to determine the anions and cations present in the pyrotechnic mixtures. Black and flash powders were easily distinguishable based on their main inorganic compositions, i.e., KNO3 and KClO4, respectively. Differentiation of flash powders from the commercial and imitation pyrotechnic items was achieved by the identification of Ca2+ and Mg2+ cation traces in the imitation flash banger powders. Quantitative CE results were used to explore the possibilities to differentiate seized sets of flash bangers but this proved to be difficult for commercial items due to lack of impurities and uniform production processes. In addition, inherent inhomogeneity of the powders and incomplete sample extraction yielded a relative high measurement uncertainty within a set. For the imitation items potential for set-based differentiation was observed. Although the number of seized imitation sets was limited, a first step has been taken to classify pyrotechnic mixtures to provide additional information and intelligence in forensic casework of flash bangers."

  "description": "Ampicillin-treated Lactococcus lactis MG1363 populations contain persisters as well as viable but non-culturable cellsLactococcus lactis is used as cell-factory and strain selections are regularly performed to improve production processes. When selection regimes only allow desired phenotypes to survive, for instance by using antibiotics to select for cells that do not grow in a specific condition, the presence of more resistant subpopulations with a wildtype genotype severely slows down the procedure. While the food grade organism L. lactis is not often exposed to antibiotics we characterized its response to ampicillin in more detail, to better understand emerging population heterogeneity and how this might affect strain selection procedures. Using growth-dependent viability assays we identified persister subpopulations in stationary and exponential phase. Growth-independent viability assays revealed a 100 times larger subpopulation that did not grow on plates or in liquid medium, but had an intact membrane and could maintain a pH gradient. Over one third of these cells restored their intracellular pH when we induced a temporary collapse, indicating that this subpopulation was metabolically active and in a viable but non-culturable state. Exposure of L. lactis MG1363 to ampicillin therefore results in a heterogeneous population response with different dormancy states.

  "description": "Antibodies Targeting Chemokine Receptors CXCR4 and ACKR3Dysregulation of the chemokine system is implicated in a number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer. Modulation of chemokine receptor function is a very promising approach for therapeutic intervention. Despite interest from academic groups and pharmaceutical companies, there are currently few approved medicines targeting chemokine receptors. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and antibody-based molecules have been successfully applied in the clinical therapy of cancer and represent a potential new class of therapeutics targeting chemokine receptors belonging to the class of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Besides conventional mAbs, single-domain antibodies and antibody scaffolds are also gaining attention as promising therapeutics. In this review, we provide an extensive overview of mAbs, single-domain antibodies, and other antibody fragments targeting CXCR4 and ACKR3, formerly referred to as CXCR7. We discuss their unique properties and advantages over small-molecule compounds, and also refer to the molecules in preclinical and clinical development. We focus on single-domain antibodies and scaffolds and their utilization in GPCR research. Additionally, structural analysis of antibody binding to CXCR4 is discussed. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Modulating the function of GPCRs, and particularly chemokine receptors, draws high interest. A comprehensive review is provided for monoclonal antibodies, antibody fragments, and variants directed at CXCR4 and ACKR3. Their advantageous functional properties, versatile applications as research tools, and use in the clinic are discussed."

  "description": "Calculating energy derivatives for quantum chemistry on a quantum computerModeling chemical reactions and complicated molecular systems has been proposed as the \u201ckiller application\u201d of a future quantum computer. Accurate calculations of derivatives of molecular eigenenergies are essential toward this end, allowing for geometry optimization, transition state searches, predictions of the response to an applied electric or magnetic field, and molecular dynamics simulations. In this work, we survey methods to calculate energy derivatives, and present two new methods: one based on quantum phase estimation, the other on a low-order response approximation. We calculate asymptotic error bounds and approximate computational scalings for the methods presented. Implementing these methods, we perform geometry optimization on an experimental quantum processor, estimating the equilibrium bond length of the dihydrogen molecule to within 0.014 \u00c5 of the full configuration interaction value. Within the same experiment, we estimate the polarizability of the H2 molecule, finding agreement at the equilibrium bond length to within 0.06 a.u. (2 % relative error)."

Chemokine receptors are also involved in multiple pathologic processes, including immune and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancer. Hence, several members of this GPCR subfamily are considered to be very relevant therapeutic targets. Since drug discovery efforts can be significantly reinforced by the availability of crystal structures, substantial efforts in the area of chemokine receptor structural biology could dramatically increase the outcome of drug discovery campaigns. This short review summarizes the available data on chemokine receptor crystal structures, discusses the numerous applications from chemokine receptor structures that can enhance the daily work of molecular pharmacologists, and describes the challenges and pitfalls to consider when relying on crystal structures for further research applications.

  "description": "Community assessment to advance computational prediction of cancer drug combinations in a pharmacogenomic screenThe effectiveness of most cancer targeted therapies is short-lived. Tumors often develop resistance that might be overcome with drug combinations. However, the number of possible combinations is vast, necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal patient-specific treatments. Here we report AstraZeneca\u2019s large drug combination dataset, consisting of 11,576 experiments from 910 combinations across 85 molecularly characterized cancer cell lines, and results of a DREAM Challenge to evaluate computational strategies for predicting synergistic drug pairs and biomarkers. 160 teams participated to provide a comprehensive methodological development and benchmarking. Winning methods incorporate prior knowledge of drug-target interactions. Synergy is predicted with an accuracy matching biological replicates for >60% of combinations. However, 20% of drug combinations are poorly predicted by all methods. Genomic rationale for synergy predictions are identified, including ADAM17 inhibitor antagonism when combined with PIK3CB/D inhibition contrasting to synergy when combined with other PI3K-pathway inhibitors in PIK3CA mutant cells."

  "description": "Comparative characterization of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) derived from patients with schizophrenia and autismHuman induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) provide an attractive tool to study disease mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia. A pertinent problem is the development of hiPSC-based assays to discriminate schizophrenia (SZ) from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) models. Healthy control individuals as well as patients with SZ and ASD were examined by a panel of diagnostic tests. Subsequently, skin biopsies were taken for the generation, differentiation, and testing of hiPSC-derived neurons from all individuals. SZ and ASD neurons share a reduced capacity for cortical differentiation as shown by quantitative analysis of the synaptic marker PSD95 and neurite outgrowth. By contrast, pattern analysis of calcium signals turned out to discriminate among healthy control, schizophrenia, and autism samples. Schizophrenia neurons displayed decreased peak frequency accompanied by increased peak areas, while autism neurons showed a slight decrease in peak amplitudes. For further analysis of the schizophrenia phenotype, transcriptome analyses revealed a clear discrimination among schizophrenia, autism, and healthy controls based on differentially expressed genes. However, considerable differences were still evident among schizophrenia patients under inspection. For one individual with schizophrenia, expression analysis revealed deregulation of genes associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) presentation pathway. Interestingly, antipsychotic treatment of healthy control neurons also increased MHC class II expression. In conclusion, transcriptome analysis combined with pattern analysis of calcium signals appeared as a tool to discriminate between SZ and ASD phenotypes in vitro."

  "description": "Compound Identification Using Liquid Chromatography and High-Resolution Noncontact Fraction Collection with a Solenoid ValveWe describe the development of a high-resolution, noncontact fraction collector for liquid chromatography (LC) separations, allowing high-resolution fractionation in high-density well plates. The device is based on a low-dead-volume solenoid valve operated at 1\u201330 Hz for accurate collection of fractions of equal volume. The solenoid valve was implemented in a modified autosampler resulting in the so-called FractioMate fractionator. The influence of the solenoid supply voltage on solvent release was determined and the effect of the frequency, flow rate, and mobile phase composition was studied. For this purpose, droplet release was visually assessed for a wide range of frequencies and flow rates, followed by quantitative evaluation of a selection of promising settings for highly accurate, repeatable, and stable fraction collection. The potential of the new fraction collector for LC-based bioactivity screening was demonstrated by fractionating the LC eluent of a mixture of estrogenic and androgenic compounds, and a surface water sample (blank and spiked with bioactives) combining mass spectrometric detection and two reporter gene assays for bioactivity detection of the fractions. Additionally, a mixture of two compounds was repeatedly LC separated and fractionated to assess the feasibility of the system for analyte isolation followed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis."

  "description": "CXCR4/AckR3 phosphorylation and recruitment of interacting proteins: Key mechanisms regulating their functional statusThe C-X-C motif chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and the atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3/CXCR7) are class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Accumulating evidence indicates that GPCR subcellular localization, trafficking, transduction properties, and ultimately their pathophysiological functions are regulated by both interacting proteins and post-translational modifications. This has encouraged the development of novel techniques to characterize the GPCR interactome and to identify residues subjected to post-translational modifications, with a special focus on phosphorylation. This review first describes state-of-the-art methods for the identification of GPCR-interacting proteins and GPCR phosphorylated sites. In addition, we provide an overview of the current knowledge of CXCR4 and ACKR3 post-translational modifications and an exhaustive list of previously identified CXCR4- or ACKR3-interacting proteins. We then describe studies highlighting the importance of the reciprocal influence of CXCR4/ACKR3 interactomes and phosphorylation states. We also discuss their impact on the functional status of each receptor. These studies suggest that deeper knowledge of the CXCR4/ACKR3 interactomes along with their phosphorylation and ubiquitination status would shed new light on their regulation and pathophysiological functions."

  "description": "Modelling the variable incorporation of aromatic amino acids in the tyrocidines and analogous cyclodecapeptidesAims: A mathematical model of the nonribosomal synthesis of tyrocidines and analogues by Brevibacillus parabrevis was constructed using a competitive binding mechanism (CBM) for the incorporation of the three variable aromatic amino acid (Aaa) residues in their sequence. These antimicrobial peptides have a conserved structure (D-Phe1-Pro2-Aaa3-D-Aaa4-Asn5-Gln6-Aaa7-Val8-Orn9-Leu10), apart from the Aaa in positions 3, 4 and 7 containing either Phe, Trp or Tyr. Methods and Results: Ultra-performance liquid chromatography linked mass spectrometry was used to profile peptides from extracts of cultures grown in media with various Phe:Trp ratios. The CBM model describes the production of peptides as a function of growth medium Aaa concentration. The model accounts for variable Aaa incorporation by simultaneously considering the influence of maximal incorporation rate and cooperativity, despite similar KM\u2019s of synthetase modules. Conclusions: Our CBM model can be utilized to predict the Aaa composition of produced peptides from the concentration of Aaas in the growth medium. Significance and Impact of the Study: Subtly exploiting the inherent promiscuity of the nontemplate coded peptide synthesis allows for external control of peptide identity, without using genetic manipulation. Such versatility is exploitable in the production of targeted peptide complexes and rare peptides where production processes are reliant on nonribosomal synthesis."

  "description": "Modulators of CXCR4 and CXCR7/AckR3 functionThe two G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) are part of the class A chemokine GPCR family and represent important drug targets for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, cancer, and inflammation diseases. CXCR4 is one of only three chemokine receptors with a US Food and Drug Administration approved therapeutic agent, the small-molecule modulator AMD3100. In this review, known modulators of the two receptors are discussed in detail. Initially, the structural relationship between receptors and ligands is reviewed on the basis of common structural motifs and available crystal structures. To date, no atypical chemokine receptor has been crystallized, which makes ligand design and predictions for these receptors more difficult. Next, the selectivity, receptor activation, and the resulting ligand-induced signaling output of chemokines and other peptide ligands are reviewed. Binding of pepducins, a class of lipid-peptides whose basis is the internal loop of a GPCR, to CXCR4 is also discussed. Finally, small-molecule modulators of CXCR4 and ACKR3 are reviewed. These modulators have led to the development of radio- and fluorescently labeled tool compounds, enabling the visualization of ligand binding and receptor characterization both in vitro and in vivo. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT To investigate the pharmacological modulation of CXCR4 and ACKR3, significant effort has been focused on the discovery and development of a range of ligands, including small-molecule modulators, pepducins, and synthetic peptides. Imaging tools, such as fluorescent probes, also play a pivotal role in the field of drug discovery. This review aims to provide an overview of the aforementioned modulators that facilitate the study of CXCR4 and ACKR3 receptors."

  "description": "Natural Killer Cell Hypo-responsiveness in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia can be Circumvented in Vitro by Adequate Activating SignalingChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by an acquired immune dysfunction, which may underlie the hampered efficacy of cellular immunotherapy. Most data on dampened immune responses in CLL come from studies investigating CLL and T cell interactions. Natural killer (NK) cells may be an attractive alternative source of effector cells in immunotherapy in CLL, provided that functionality is retained within the CLL micro-environment. Despite their important role in anti-tumor responses, NK cells are not extensively characterized in CLL. Here, we studied the expression of activating and inhibitory receptors on CLL-derived and healthy control (HC) NK cells, and their functional response towards several stimuli.NK cells from CLL patients have an increased maturation stage, with an expansion of NKG2C+ NK cells in CMV seropositive individuals. The cytotoxicity receptor NKG2D is downregulated, and the killing capacity through this receptor was markedly reduced in CLL-derived NK cells. In contrast, activation via CD16 (FC\u03b3RIII) led to adequate activation and functional responses in CLL-derived NK cells. These findings indicate that NK cells in CLL are not intrinsically defect and still perform effector functions upon adequate activating signaling. Clinical relevance of this finding was shown by treatment with novel nanobody-Fc constructs, which induced cytotoxic responses in both CLL- and HC-derived NK cells via CD16. Our results show that NK cells, in contrast to the T cell compartment, retain their function within the CLL micro-environment, provided that they receive an adequate activating signal. These findings warrant future studies on NK cell mediated immunotherapeutic strategies in CLL."

  "description": "Probe dependency in the determination of ligand binding kinetics at a prototypical G protein-coupled receptorDrug-target binding kinetics are suggested to be important parameters for the prediction of in vivo drug-efficacy. For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the binding kinetics of ligands are typically determined using association binding experiments in competition with radiolabelled probes, followed by analysis with the widely used competitive binding kinetics theory developed by Motulsky and Mahan. Despite this, the influence of the radioligand binding kinetics on the kinetic parameters derived for the ligands tested is often overlooked. To address this, binding rate constants for a series of histamine H1 receptor (H1R) antagonists were determined using radioligands with either slow (low koff) or fast (high koff) dissociation characteristics. A correlation was observed between the probe-specific datasets for the kinetic binding affinities, association rate constants and dissociation rate constants. However, the magnitude and accuracy of the binding rate constant-values was highly dependent on the used radioligand probe. Further analysis using recently developed fluorescent binding methods corroborates the finding that the Motulsky-Mahan methodology is limited by the employed assay conditions. The presented data suggest that kinetic parameters of GPCR ligands depend largely on the characteristics of the probe used and results should therefore be viewed within the experimental context and limitations of the applied methodology."

Most suitable biomarkers for patient selection include c-Met amplification and exon-14 skipping. Our retrospective study focused on the frequency of different c-Met aberrations (overexpression, amplification and mutations) in 153 primary, therapy-na\u00efve resection samples and their paired metastases, from Biobank@UZA. Furthermore, we determined the correlation of c-Met expression with clinicopathological factors, Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-status and TP53 mutations. Our results showed that c-Met expression levels in primary tumors were comparable to their respective metastases. Five different mutations were detected by deep sequencing: Three (E168D, S203T, N375S) previously described and two never reported (I333T, G783E). I333T, a new mutation in the Sema(phorin) domain of c-Met, might influence the binding of antibodies targeting the HGF-binding domain, potentially causing innate resistance. E168D and S203T mutations showed a trend towards a correlation with high c-Met expression (p = 0.058). We found a significant correlation between c-MET expression, EGFR expression (p = 0.010) and EGFR mutations (p = 0.013), as well as a trend (p = 0.057) with regards to TP53 mutant activity. In conclusion this study demonstrated a strong correlation between EGFR mutations, TP53 and c-Met expression in therapy-na\u00efve primary resection samples. Moreover, we found two new c-Met mutations that warrant further studies."

  "description": "Genome-Scale Metabolic Reconstruction of Acetobacter pasteurianus 386B, a Candidate Functional Starter Culture for Cocoa Bean FermentationAcetobacter pasteurianus 386B is a candidate functional starter culture for the cocoa bean fermentation process. To allow in silico simulations of its related metabolism in response to different environmental conditions, a genome-scale metabolic model for A. pasteurianus 386B was reconstructed. This is the first genome-scale metabolic model reconstruction for a member of the genus Acetobacter. The metabolic network reconstruction process was based on extensive genome re-annotation and comparative genomics analyses. The information content related to the functional annotation of metabolic enzymes and transporters was placed in a metabolic context by exploring and curating a Pathway/Genome Database of A. pasteurianus 386B using the Pathway Tools software. Metabolic reactions and curated gene-protein-reaction associations were bundled into a genome-scale metabolic model of A. pasteurianus 386B, named iAp386B454, containing 454 genes, 322 reactions, and 296 metabolites embedded in two cellular compartments. The reconstructed model was validated by performing growth experiments in a defined medium, which revealed that lactic acid as the sole carbon source could sustain growth of this strain. Further, the reconstruction of the A. pasteurianus 386B genome-scale metabolic model revealed knowledge gaps concerning the metabolism of this strain, especially related to the biosynthesis of its cell envelope and the presence or absence of metabolite transporters."

We designed, synthesized and characterized a series of 6 potential covalent ligands for the histamine H3 receptor (H3R). Starting from a 2-amino-pyrimidine scaffold, optimization of anchor moiety and warhead followed by fine-tuning of the required reactivity via scaffold hopping resulted in the isothiocyanate H3R ligand 44. It shows high reactivity toward glutathione combined with appropriate stability in water and reacts selectively with the cysteine sidechain in a model nonapeptide equipped with nucleophilic residues. The covalent interaction of 44 with H3R was validated with washout experiments and leads to inverse agonism on H3R. Irreversible binder 44 (VUF15662) may serve as a useful tool compound to stabilize the inactive H3R conformation and to study the consequences of prolonged inhibition of the H3R."

  "description": "Identifying indigenous practices for cultivation of wild saprophytic mushrooms: responding to the need for sustainable utilization of natural resourcesBACKGROUND: Due to increasing pressure on natural resources, subsistence agriculture communities in Uganda and Sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing increasingly restricted access to diminishing natural resources that are a critical requirement of their livelihoods. Previously, common-pool resources like forests and grasslands have been either gazetted for conservation or leased for agriculture, the latter in particular for large-scale sugarcane production. Satisfying the increasing consumer demand for grassland or forestry products like wild mushrooms as food or medicine, requires innovative ethno-biological and industry development strategies to improve production capacity, while easing the pressure on diminishing natural resources and averting ecosystems degradation. METHODS: This case study addresses traditional knowledge systems for artisanal mycoculture to identify cultivation practices that enhance sustainable utilization of natural resources. Multi-scalar stakeholder engagement across government and community sectors identified artisanal mushroom producers across five districts in Uganda. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews characterized artisanal production methods and identified locally used substrates for cultivation of different mushroom species. RESULTS: Artisanal practices were characterized for the cultivation of six wild saprophytic mushroom species including Volvariella speciosa (akasukusuku), twoTermitomyces sp. (obunegyere and another locally unnamed species), Agaricus sp. (ensyabire) and Agrocybe sp. (emponzira), and one exotic Pleurotus sp. (oyster) that are used as food or medicine. The substrates used for each species differed according to the mushroom's mode of decomposition, those being the following: tertiary decomposers such as those growing under rotting tree stumps or logs from forestry activity like the Agrocybe sp. known as emponzira which grows in forests, thickets, or near homesteads where big logs of hardwood have been left to rot. Also pieces of firewood are chipped off whenever need arises thus providing fuel; secondary decomposers growing on naturally composted grass associated with termites like the Termitomyces sp. known as obunegyere growing in protected sites in gardens, composted cattle manure for Agaricus sp. known as ensyabire in the kraal area where cattle manure is plenty, composted maize cobs for a locally unnamed Agaricus sp. on heaped cobs placed near homesteads; and primary decomposers growing on waste sorghum from brewing the traditional alcoholic drink, muramba for Pleurotus sp. (oyster), and banana and spear grass residue from banana juice processing like the Volvariella speciosa known as akasukusuku because it is associated with the banana plantation locally known in the Luganda language as olusuku and is usually heaped under ficus trees. Management practices also varied based on mode of decomposition and other ecological requirements such as the following: zero tillage and minimal disturbance in areas where obunegyere grow, heaping banana and spear grass residues under the cool ficus trees which also keep them away from banana stump that may cause infestation with nematodes and insects. Even within the generic practices accessibility by the users is critical for example placing logs near homes where children can use them to play, they can be used as fire wood and to even get off-season mushroom as household waste water can make the mushrooms grow. CONCLUSIONS: Our description of artisanal mycoculture methods that respond to conservation and utilization pressures, demonstrates the value of addressing traditional knowledge to improve ethno-biology and mycoculture industry practice. Traditional communities engage in multiple technological and organizational innovations and practices for sustainability and in the case of mushroom production to conserve the environment and culture, ensure variety, food and nutrition security, and income. The results of this study present opportunities to preserve ecosystem quality while developing an artisanal mycoculture system. They have also identified aspects of artisanal mycoculture that most urgently require further ethno-biological study and industry development. Future research and industry development can utilize the result of this study to boost artisanal production of wild saprophytic mushrooms in Sub-Saharan countries, for food or medicinal consumption, and environment conservation. Further development of production efficiencies in context with sustainable natural resource management is recommended."

While many food producers invest in adopting sustainable and/or environmentally friendly packaging for regular foods, such as milk or juice, it remains unclear why consumers choose to buy regular food in such packaging, especially when it is more expensive and other alternatives are available. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic literature review of all studies on the predictors of consumer food purchasing in environmentally friendly packaging published in the period 1994-2019. The guiding research question of this study is: Which factors influence the consumers' decision to purchase food in environmentally friendly packaging? To review the extant research on the factors influencing consumers' decision to purchase food in environmentally friendly packaging, we employed a systematic literature review methodology. The review revealed that, although the extant research is growing, it is very limited in terms of the theories utilized to explain consumer purchasing behavior and in the range of the tested predictors of consumers' purchasing of foods in environmentally friendly packaging. Among the existing explanations are demographics, consumer attitudes, knowledge about the environmental effects of packaging, visual designs, functionality, cross-cultural differences, and affordability. The paper is concluded with a discussion of the implications of this systematic literature review for future research and practice. Among the leading recommendations are: (a) to go beyond Ajzen's theoretical explanations of consumer purchasing behaviors; (b) to examine a broader set of predictors; (c) to draw on more interconnected complex models that include both internal and external factors; (d) to conduct cross-cultural comparative studies; (e) to address the gap between attitudes and behaviors; and (f) to consider the role of organizations and government in the transition to more sustainable consumer purchasing behavior, rather than only searching for individual predictors of behaviors.General information",

  "description": "Method development for effect-directed analysis of endocrine disrupting compounds in human amniotic fluidThe developing fetus represents a highly sensitive period of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). However, risk assessment of EDCs is hampered by the lack of data on direct in utero exposure. In this study, we developed a robust analytical methodology for the identification of a wide range of known and unknown EDCs in full-term amniotic fluid (AF). First, a method for extraction and fractionation of a broad range of polar and nonpolar EDCs was developed and validated. Maximal recoveries of reference compounds and minimal interference from the matrix were achieved with a combination of solid phase extraction and dispersive liquid/liquid extraction. Bioassay analysis using cell-based reporter gene assays revealed estrogenic, androgenic, and dioxin-like activity in AF extract corresponding to 1.4 nmol EEQ/L, 76.6 pmol DHT-EQ/L, and 10.1 pmol TEQ/L, respectively. Targeted analysis revealed 13 xenobiotics, phytoestrogens, and endogenous hormones in the AF extract that partly contributed to the bioassay activity. Separation of the complex mixture of chemicals in the AF extract with reversed-phase chromatographic fractionation and subsequent bioassay analysis revealed activity in fractions over a wide range of polarity, indicating diverse (unidentified) substances with potential ED activity. The method developed here represents the first methodological step in an effect-directed analysis approach to identify unknown biologically active compounds in the fetal environment."

  "description": "Solenodon genome reveals convergent evolution of venom in eulipotyphlan mammalsVenom systems are key adaptations that have evolved throughout the tree of life and typically facilitate predation or defense. Despite venoms being model systems for studying a variety of evolutionary and physiological processes, many taxonomic groups remain understudied, including venomous mammals. Within the order Eulipotyphla, multiple shrew species and solenodons have oral venom systems. Despite morphological variation of their delivery systems, it remains unclear whether venom represents the ancestral state in this group or is the result of multiple independent origins. We investigated the origin and evolution of venom in eulipotyphlans by characterizing the venom system of the endangered Hispaniolan solenodon (Solenodon paradoxus). We constructed a genome to underpin proteomic identifications of solenodon venom toxins, before undertaking evolutionary analyses of those constituents, and functional assessments of the secreted venom. Our findings show that solenodon venom consists of multiple paralogous kallikrein 1 (KLK1) serine proteases, which cause hypotensive effects in vivo, and seem likely to have evolved to facilitate vertebrate prey capture. Comparative analyses provide convincing evidence that the oral venom systems of solenodons and shrews have evolved convergently, with the 4 independent origins of venom in eulipotyphlans outnumbering all other venom origins in mammals. We find that KLK1s have been independently coopted into the venom of shrews and solenodons following their divergence during the late Cretaceous, suggesting that evolutionary constraints may be acting on these genes. Consequently, our findings represent a striking example of convergent molecular evolution and demonstrate that distinct structural backgrounds can yield equivalent functions."

  "description": "Efficiency evaluation of regional sustainable innovation in China: A slack-based measure (SBM) model with undesirable outputsAn efficiency evaluation of China\u2019s regional sustainable innovation, evaluating industrial waste and total energy consumption, is the main research subject in this paper. It focuses on a regional measurement and comparison of these undesirable outputs of Chinese firm activities, such as industrial SO2 and CO2 emissions. By applying a data envelopment analysis\u2013slack-based measure (DEA\u2013SBM) model with undesirable outputs indicators, the regional innovation efficiency was evaluated for 30 provinces in China, from 2002 to 2014. The results indicate that the sustainable innovation efficiency of overall China is still relatively low, and varies significantly in different regions. Central and Western China have similar sustainable innovation efficiencies, which are much lower than the sustainable innovation efficiency in Eastern China. Furthermore, the data indicate that regional sustainable innovation efficiency disparities among these three areas are decreasing. Based on these findings, reasons for the sustainable innovation efficiency gap among the different regions were analyzed. To scholars, this paper extends the research on regional sustainable innovation efficiency by implementing an undesirable output perspective to the DEA\u2013SBM model. The findings also provide Chinese policy makers with useful decision support insights for regional sustainable innovation, and energy conservation and emission reduction policies."

  "description": "Analytical chemistry on many-center chiral compounds based on vibrational circular dichroism: Absolute configuration assignments and determination of contaminant levelsThe absolute configuration of a chiral molecule is key to its biological activity. Being able to find out what this configuration is, is thus crucial for a wide range of applications. The difficulties associated with such a determination steeply rise as the number of chiral centers in a given compound becomes larger. Concurrently, it becomes increasingly more challenging to determine the levels and identity of potential stereochemical contaminants in a given sample with one and the same technique, leading in practice to extensive and laborious efforts employing multiple analytical techniques. Here, experimental and theoretical studies based on Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) are presented for dydrogesterone, a synthetic drug employed in reproductive medicine that is a prototypical example of such a multi-center chiral compound. We show that our approach allows us to distinguish and assign its absolute configuration without prior knowledge to one of the 64 possible stereoisomers associated with the six chiral centers. Studies on mixtures of dydrogesterone and 6-dehydroprogesterone, one of the diastereomers of dydrogesterone and generally the dominant impurity of dehydrogesterone, show that we can identify the presence of both compounds from one single VCD spectrum. Moreover, we find that we can determine diastereomeric contamination levels as low as 5% from the experimental VCD spectra."

  "description": "Toward Transition-Metal-Templated Construction of Arylated B4 Chains by Dihydroborane DehydrocouplingThe reactivity of a diruthenium tetrahydride complex towards three selected dihydroboranes was investigated. The use of [DurBH2] (Dur=2,3,5,6-Me4C6H) and [(Me3Si)2NBH2] led to the formation of bridging borylene complexes of the form [(Cp*RuH)2BR] (Cp*=C5Me5; 1 a: R=Dur; 1 b: R=N(SiMe3)2) through oxidative addition of the B\u2212H bonds with concomitant hydrogen liberation. Employing the more electron-deficient dihydroborane [3,5-(CF3)2-C6H3BH2] led to the formation of an anionic complex bearing a tetraarylated chain of four boron atoms, namely Li(THF)4[(Cp*Ru)2B4H5(3,5-(CF3)2C6H3)4] (4), through an unusual, incomplete threefold dehydrocoupling process. A comparative theoretical investigation of the bonding in a simplified model of 4 and the analogous complex nido-[1,2(Cp*Ru)2(\u03bc-H)B4H9] (I) indicates that there appear to be no classical \u03c3-bonds between the boron atoms in complex I, whereas in the case of 4 the B4 chain better resembles a network of three B\u2212B \u03c3 bonds, the central bond being significantly weaker than the other two."

  "description": "A framework for digital transformation and business model innovationWith the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, businesses are adapting to the use of digitalisation which requires the digital transformation of their existing business models. However, there is limited empirical research on this phenomenon. The purpose of this study is twofold: (i) to develop a framework for businesses to digitally transform their business models and (ii) to examine literature in order to identify and analyse the constructs underlying the three concepts of Digitalisation, Digital Transformation and Business Model Innovation. The study is qualitative in nature and is based on a narrative review. Relevant articles were identified by using international bibliographic databases and scrutinised using thematic analysis. The findings reveal that the first two constructs require digital capabilities and a digital strategy. The third construct requires digital transformation in the realm of customer-centricity, resources, processes and profit. A set of propositions was formulated and the commonalities were mapped. Based upon this map, a conceptual framework was developed. The findings will assist in the development of future instruments that can guide businesses to digitally transform existing business model elements. This study aims to fill the gap on how business model innovation should be pursued through digital transformation by developing a conceptual framework."

  "description": "Enhancement of amino acid production and secretion by Lactococcus lactis using a droplet-based biosensing and selection systemAmino acids are attractive metabolites for the pharmaceutical and food industry field. On one hand, the construction of microbial cell factories for large-scale production aims to satisfy the demand for amino acids as bulk biochemical. On the other hand, amino acids enhance flavor formation in fermented foods. Concerning the latter, flavor formation in dairy products, such as cheese is associated with the presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In particular, Lactococcus lactis, one of the most important LAB, is used as a starter culture in fermented foods. The proteolytic activity of some L. lactis strains results in peptides and amino acids, which are flavor compounds or flavor precursors. However, it is still a challenge to isolate bacterial cells with enhanced amino acid production and secretion activity. In this work, we developed a growth-based sensor strain to detect the essential amino acids isoleucine, leucine, valine, histidine and methionine. Amino acids are metabolites that can be secreted by some bacteria. Therefore, our biosensor allowed us to identify wild-type L. lactis strains that naturally secrete amino acids, by using co-cultures of the biosensor strain with potential amino acid producing strains. Subsequently, we used this biosensor in combination with a droplet-based screening approach, and isolated three mutated L. lactis IPLA838 strains with 5\u201310 fold increased amino acid-secretion compared to the wild type. Genome re-sequencing revealed mutations in genes encoding proteins that participate in peptide uptake and peptide degradation. We argue that an unbalance in the regulation of amino acid levels as a result of these gene mutations may drive the accumulation and secretion of these amino acids. This biosensing system tackles the problem of selection for overproduction of secreted molecules, which requires the coupling of the product to the producing cell in the droplets."

  "description": "Enterococcus spp. in Brazilian artisanal cheeses: Occurrence and assessment of phenotypic and safety properties of a large set of strains through the use of high throughput tools combined with multivariate statisticsTraditionally fermented food generally has unique sensorial aspects due to its high microbial diversity, being broadly consumed worldwide. Despite this, some Vancomycin-Resistant-Enterococci (VRE) can occur in these products, which raises questions about their safety. Thus, this study tries to assess information about the occurrence of Enterococcus strains in traditional Brazilian cheese samples collected from the five main regions as well as the characterization of their phenotypic (proteolytic, lipolytic and bacteriogenic potential) and safety (hemolysin activity and growth at commercial VRE selecting media) aspects. A total of 1669 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, of which 605 (36.2%) were identified as Enterococcus by 16sRNA sequencing. Out of these, E. faecium (58.7%) was identified as the dominant species, followed by Enterococcus faecalis (31.8%), Enterococcus durans (4.8%), Enterococcus hermanniensis (1.6%) and Enterococcus gilvus (1.6%). All the data were analyzed by multivariate statistics, and the findings highlighted the presence of Enterococcus as a naturally component of indigenous microbiota of Brazilian artisanal cheeses, mostly in the cheeses of Maraj\u00f3, Coalho, and Manteiga, possibly as a consequence of their heat resistance and the curd cooking step applied during the process in these regions. The majority of the identified Enterococcus (63.1%) did not produce \u03b2-hemolysin and were not resistant to vancomycin. Interestingly some of these strains (21.4%) were able to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 35152, mostly isolates from Serrano, Colonial, and Minas artisanal (from Cerrado microregion) cheeses. Also, 10.2 and 11.8% of them have shown moderate to high proteolytic and lipolytic activity, respectively. Anti-listerial activity is of most interest as it can contribute to reduce risk of listeriosis due to dairy products consumption, while proteolysis and lipolysis are responsible for some remarkable features (e. g. flavor, taste, and texture) of fermented foods. In summary, this study represents a contribution towards revealing some phenotypic and safety traits of a large set of strains of Enterococcus strains through the use of multivariate statistics combined with high throughput tools."

  "description": "Innovation in pharmaceutical R&D: mapping the research landscapeIn response to the increasing number and breadth of innovation studies on the pharmaceutical industry, we mapped the literature to show the trends in recent research and to indicate areas for further research. In the first phase, we analyzed articles on the pharmaceutical industry published in innovation journals. We used these articles\u2019 textual and citation data and applied hybrid cluster analysis. Three main clusters were produced basedon the level of analysis innovation scholars had used to investigate the industry: macro, meso and micro. We describe theresearch topics within these clusters and show that, overall, innovation scholars increasingly focus on the meso-level, analyzing the relationships across different firms. This shift in interest toward the collaborative nature of drug discovery and development was also apparent in macro- and micro-level studies. To explore how this literature is used by scientists in the industry, our second phase involved analysis of the citing articles published in pharmaceutical journals. Using our findings, we propose research areas that can be further explored in order to create an engaged and better-integrated literature on pharmaceutical innovation."

Targeting immunometabolism is proposed as a strategy to revert aberrant macrophage activation to improve disease outcome. Here, we show ATP citrate lyase (Acly) to be activated in inflammatory macrophages and human atherosclerotic plaques. We demonstrate that myeloid Acly deficiency induces a stable plaque phenotype characterized by increased collagen deposition and fibrous cap thickness, along with a smaller necrotic core. In-depth functional, lipidomic, and transcriptional characterization indicate deregulated fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and reduced liver X receptor activation within the macrophages in vitro. This results in macrophages that are more prone to undergo apoptosis, whilst maintaining their capacity to phagocytose apoptotic cells. Together, our results indicate that targeting macrophage metabolism improves atherosclerosis outcome and we reveal Acly as a promising therapeutic target to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques."

  "description": "A European proposal for quality control and quality assurance of tandem mass spectral librariesBackground: High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is being used increasingly in the context of suspect and non-targeted screening for the identification of bioorganic molecules. There is correspondingly increasing awareness that higher confidence identification will require a systematic, group effort to increase the fraction of compounds with tandem mass spectra available in central, publicly available resources. While typical suspect screening efforts will only result in tentative annotations with a moderate level of confidence, library spectral matches will yield higher confidence or even full confirmation of the identity if the reference standards are available. Results: This article first explores representative percent coverage of measured tandem mass spectra in selected major environmental suspect databases of interest in the context of human biomonitoring, demonstrating the current extensive gap between the number of potential substances of interest (up to hundreds of thousands) and measured spectra (0.57\u20133.6% of the total chemicals have spectral information available). Furthermore, certain datasets are benchmarked, based on previous efforts, to show the extent to which acquired experimental data were comparable between laboratories, even with HRMS instruments based on different technologies (i.e., quadrupole\u2013quadrupole-time of flight versus ion trap/quadrupole-Orbitrap). Instruments and settings that are less comparable are also revealed, primarily linear ion trap instruments, which show distinctly lower comparability. Conclusions: Based on these efforts, harmonization guidelines for the acquisition and processing of tandem mass spectrometry data are proposed to enable European (and ideally worldwide) laboratories to contribute to common resources, without requiring extensive changes to their current in house methods."

  "description": "A Unified Framework for Understanding Nucleophilicity and Protophilicity in the SN2/E2 CompetitionThe concepts of nucleophilicity and protophilicity are fundamental and ubiquitous in chemistry. A case in point is bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (SN2) and base-induced elimination (E2). A Lewis base acting as a strong nucleophile is needed for SN2 reactions, whereas a Lewis base acting as a strong protophile (i.e., base) is required for E2 reactions. A complicating factor is, however, the fact that a good nucleophile is often a strong protophile. Nevertheless, a sound, physical model that explains, in a transparent manner, when an electron-rich Lewis base acts as a protophile or a nucleophile, which is not just phenomenological, is currently lacking in the literature. To address this fundamental question, the potential energy surfaces of the SN2 and E2 reactions of X\u2212+C2H5Y model systems with X, Y = F, Cl, Br, I, and At, are explored by using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-OLYP/TZ2P. These explorations have yielded a consistent overview of reactivity trends over a wide range in reactivity and pathways. Activation strain analyses of these reactions reveal the factors that determine the shape of the potential energy surfaces and hence govern the propensity of the Lewis base to act as a nucleophile or protophile. The concepts of \u201ccharacteristic distortivity\u201d and \u201ctransition state acidity\u201d of a reaction are introduced, which have the potential to enable chemists to better understand and design reactions for synthesis."

  "description": "Characterization of glycosyl dioxolenium ions and their role in glycosylation reactionsControlling the chemical glycosylation reaction remains the major challenge in the synthesis of oligosaccharides. Though 1,2-trans glycosidic linkages can be installed using neighboring group participation, the construction of 1,2-cis linkages is difficult and has no general solution. Long-range participation (LRP) by distal acyl groups may steer the stereoselectivity, but contradictory results have been reported on the role and strength of this stereoelectronic effect. It has been exceedingly difficult to study the bridging dioxolenium ion intermediates because of their high reactivity and fleeting nature. Here we report an integrated approach, using infrared ion spectroscopy, DFT computations, and a systematic series of glycosylation reactions to probe these ions in detail. Our study reveals how distal acyl groups can play a decisive role in shaping the stereochemical outcome of a glycosylation reaction, and opens new avenues to exploit these species in the assembly of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates to fuel biological research."

  "description": "Dynamic and Internal Longest Common SubstringGiven two strings S and T, each of length at most n, the longest common substring (LCS) problem is to find a longest substring common to S and T. This is a classical problem in computer science with an O(n) -time solution. In the fully dynamic setting, edit operations are allowed in either of the two strings, and the problem is to find an LCS after each edit. We present the first solution to the fully dynamic LCS problem requiring sublinear time in n per edit operation. In particular, we show how to find an LCS after each edit operation in O~ (n2 / 3) time, after O~ (n) -time and space preprocessing. This line of research has been recently initiated in a somewhat restricted dynamic variant by Amir et al. [SPIRE 2017]. More specifically, the authors presented an O~ (n) -sized data structure that returns an LCS of the two strings after a single edit operation (that is reverted afterwards) in O~ (1) time. At CPM 2018, three papers (Abedin et al., Funakoshi et al., and Urabe et al.) studied analogously restricted dynamic variants of problems on strings; specifically, computing the longest palindrome and the Lyndon factorization of a string after a single edit operation. We develop dynamic sublinear-time algorithms for both of these problems as well. We also consider internal LCS queries, that is, queries in which we are to return an LCS of a pair of substrings of S and T. We show that answering such queries is hard in general and propose efficient data structures for several restricted cases."

  "description": "Embracing local suppression and enhancement of dynamic correlation effects in a CAS\u03a0DFT method for efficient description of excited statesThe recently proposed CAS\u03a0DFT method combines the reliable description of nondynamic electron correlation with the complete active space (CAS) wavefunction and the efficient treatment of dynamic correlation by density functional theory (DFT). This marriage is accomplished by adopting the DFT correlation energy functional modified with the local correction function of the on-top pair density (\u03a0). The role of the correction function is to sensitize the correlation functional to local effects of suppression and enhancement of dynamic correlation and to account for an adequate amount of dynamic correlation energy. In this work we show that the presence of covalent and ionic configurations in a wavefunction gives rise to spatial regions where the effects of suppression and enhancement of correlation energy, respectively, dominate. The results obtained for the potential energy curves of the excited states of the hydrogen molecule prove that CAS\u03a0DFT is reliable for states that change their character along the dissociation curve. The method is also applied to the lowest excited states of six-membered heterocyclic nitrogen compounds such as pyridine, pyrazine, pyrimidine, and pyridazine. The obtained excitation energies for the n \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 and \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 excitations confirm the good performance of CAS\u03a0DFT for excited states. The absolute average error of the method is 0.1 eV lower than that of the CCSD method and higher by the same amount than that of the more expansive CC3 variant. Compared with the coupled cluster methods, this encouraging performance of CAS\u03a0DFT is achieved at the negligible computational cost of obtaining the correlation energy."

  "description": "Evaluation of the effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the zebrafish touch-evoked response: quantitative vs. qualitative assessmentBackground: The difficulty of finding new treatments for neurological diseases with great impact in our society like Alzheimer\u2019s disease can be ascribed in part to the complexity of the nervous system and the lack of quick and cost-effective screening tools. Such tools could not only help to identify potential novel treatments, but could also be used to test environmental contaminants for their potential to cause neurotoxicity. It has been estimated that 5\u201310% of the anthropogenic chemicals are developmental neurotoxic (DNT) and exposure to DNT compounds has been linked to several neurological diseases. Within this study we were testing the applicability of a quick and cost-effective behavioural test using zebrafish embryos: the touch-evoked response assay, in this case, an assay evaluating the swimming response to a tap in the tail. Two acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors positive controls (paraoxon and huprine Y), as well as 10 huprine-derivative compounds were tested and the results were evaluated using 2 different methods, a quantitative and a qualitative one. Results: We could show that the methodology presented is able to detect behavioural effects of AChE inhibitors. A good correlation between the results obtained with the quantitative and the qualitative method was obtained (R2 = 0.84). Conclusions: Our proposed method enables combination of screening for new drugs with toxicity screening in a whole embryo model alternative to animal experimentation, thereby merging 2 drug development steps into one."

In the microcosm, polyurethane foams, cellulose acetate cigarette filters, and compostable polyester and polylactic acid items readily sank, whereas polyethylene air pouches, latex balloons, polystyrene foams and polypropylene cups remained afloat. Microbial biofilms dominated by Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Bacteriodetes grew on the plastics, and caused some of the polyethylene items to sink to the bottom. Electrical resistances (ER) of plastic items decreased as function of time, an indication that seawater had penetrated into microscopic crevices in the plastic that had developed over time. Rate constants for ER decrease in polyethylene items in the microcosm were similar to tensile elongation decrease of polyethylene sheets floating in sea, measured previously by others. Weight loss of plastic items was \u2264 1% per year for polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene, 3\u20135% for latex, polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane, 15% for cellulose acetate, and 7\u201327% for polyester and polylactic acid compostable bags. The formation of microplastics observed in the microcosm was responsible for at least part of the weight loss. This study emphasizes the need to obtain experimental data on plastic litter degradation under conditions that are realistic for marine environments."

The expression is based on a constrained search formalism for a supramolecular wavefunction that is forced to leave the diagonal of the many-body density matrix of each fragment unchanged, and is exact for the interaction between one-electron densities. We discuss several aspects: the necessary features of a density functional approximation for the exchange-correlation holes of the monomers, the optimal choice of the one-electron basis (named \"dispersals\"), and the functional derivative with respect to monomer density variations."

  "description": "Mechanism of biomolecular recognition of trimethyllysine by the fluorinated aromatic cage of KDM5A PHD3 fingerThe understanding of biomolecular recognition of posttranslationally modified histone proteins is centrally important to the histone code hypothesis. Despite extensive binding and structural studies on the readout of histones, the molecular language by which posttranslational modifications on histone proteins are read remains poorly understood. Here we report physical-organic chemistry studies on the recognition of the positively charged trimethyllysine by the electron-rich aromatic cage containing PHD3 finger of KDM5A. The aromatic character of two tryptophan residues that solely constitute the aromatic cage of KDM5A was fine-tuned by the incorporation of fluorine substituents. Our thermodynamic analyses reveal that the wild-type and fluorinated KDM5A PHD3 fingers associate equally well with trimethyllysine. This work demonstrates that the biomolecular recognition of trimethyllysine by fluorinated aromatic cages is associated with weaker cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions that are compensated by the energetically more favourable trimethyllysine-mediated release of high-energy water molecules that occupy the aromatic cage."

  "description": "Nature and Strength of Lewis Acid/Base Interaction in Boron and Nitrogen TrihalidesWe have quantum chemically investigated the bonding between archetypical Lewis acids and bases. Our state-of-the-art computations on the X3B\u2212NY3 Lewis pairs have revealed the origin behind the systematic increase in B\u2212N bond strength as X and Y are varied from F to Cl, Br, I, H. For H3B\u2212NY3, the bonding trend is driven by the commonly accepted mechanism of donor\u2212acceptor [HOMO(base)\u2212LUMO(acid)] interaction. Interestingly, for X3B\u2212NH3, the bonding mechanism is determined by the energy required to deform the BX3 to the pyramidal geometry it adopts in the adduct. Thus, Lewis acids that can more easily pyramidalize form stronger bonds with Lewis bases. The decrease in the strain energy of pyramidalization on going from BF3 to BI3 is directly caused by the weakening of the B\u2212X bond strength, which stems primarily from the bonding in the plane of the molecule (\u03c3-like) and not in the \u03c0 system, at variance with the currently accepted mechanism."

  "description": "ROS networks: designs, aging, Parkinson\u2019s disease and precision therapiesHow the network around ROS protects against oxidative stress and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and how processes at the minutes timescale cause disease and aging after decades, remains enigmatic. Challenging whether the ROS network is as complex as it seems, we built a fairly comprehensive version thereof which we disentangled into a hierarchy of only five simpler subnetworks each delivering one type of robustness. The comprehensive dynamic model described in vitro data sets from two independent laboratories. Notwithstanding its five-fold robustness, it exhibited a relatively sudden breakdown, after some 80 years of virtually steady performance: it predicted aging. PD-related conditions such as lack of DJ-1 protein or increased \u03b1-synuclein accelerated the collapse, while antioxidants or caffeine retarded it. Introducing a new concept (aging-time-control coefficient), we found that as many as 25 out of 57 molecular processes controlled aging. We identified new targets for \u201clife-extending interventions\u201d: mitochondrial synthesis, KEAP1 degradation, and p62 metabolism."

  "description": "The atypical chemokine receptor 3 interacts with Connexin 43 inhibiting astrocytic gap junctional intercellular communicationThe atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) plays a pivotal role in directing the migration of various cellular populations and its over-expression in tumors promotes cell proliferation and invasiveness. The intracellular signaling pathways transducing ACKR3-dependent effects remain poorly characterized, an issue we addressed by identifying the interactome of ACKR3. Here, we report that recombinant ACKR3 expressed in HEK293T cells recruits the gap junction protein Connexin 43 (Cx43). Cx43 and ACKR3 are co-expressed in mouse brain astrocytes and human glioblastoma cells and form a complex in embryonic mouse brain. Functional in vitro studies show enhanced ACKR3 interaction with Cx43 upon ACKR3 agonist stimulation. Furthermore, ACKR3 activation promotes \u03b2-arrestin2- and dynamin-dependent Cx43 internalization to inhibit gap junctional intercellular communication in primary astrocytes. These results demonstrate a functional link between ACKR3 and gap junctions that might be of pathophysiological relevance."

  "description": "The Nature of Nonclassical Carbonyl Ligands Explained by Kohn\u2013Sham Molecular Orbital TheoryWhen carbonyl ligands coordinate to transition metals, their bond distance either increases (classical) or decreases (nonclassical) with respect to the bond length in the isolated CO molecule. C\u2212O expansion can easily be understood by \u03c0-back-donation, which results in a population of the CO's \u03c0*-antibonding orbital and hence a weakening of its bond. Nonclassical carbonyl ligands are less straightforward to explain, and their nature is still subject of an ongoing debate. In this work, we studied five isoelectronic octahedral complexes, namely Fe(CO)62+, Mn(CO)6+, Cr(CO)6, V(CO)6\u2212 and Ti(CO)62\u2212, at the ZORA-BLYP/TZ2P level of theory to explain this nonclassical behavior in the framework of Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory. We show that there are two competing forces that affect the C\u2212O bond length, namely electrostatic interactions (favoring C\u2212O contraction) and \u03c0-back-donation (favoring C\u2212O expansion). It is a balance between those two terms that determines whether the carbonyl is classical or nonclassical. By further decomposing the electrostatic interaction \u0394Velstat into four fundamental terms, we are able to rationalize why \u0394Velstat gives rise to the nonclassical behavior, leading to new insights into the driving forces behind C\u2212O contraction."

We first focus on the H atom, both in the spin-polarized and the spin-unpolarized cases, reporting numerical and analytical results. In particular, we derive an asymptotic equation that turns out to have simple analytical solutions for certain channels. The asymptotic H atom solution for the spin-unpolarized case is then shown to be variationally optimal for the many-electron spin-restricted closed-shell case, providing expressions for the large coupling-strength density functionals up to the third leading order. We also analyze the H2 molecule and the uniform electron gas. "

We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm on a series of water clusters with up to 432 atoms and 7776 basis functions and observe asymptotic quadratic scaling with realistic threshold qualities controlling distance effects and basis sets of triple-\u03b6 (TZ) plus double polarization quality. Also owing to a very small prefactor, a G0W0 calculation for the largest of these clusters takes only 240 CPU hours with these settings. We assess the accuracy of our algorithm for HOMO and LUMO energies in the GW100 database. With errors of 0.24 eV for HOMO energies on the quadruple-\u03b6 level, our implementation is less accurate than canonical all-electron implementations using the larger def2-QZVP GTO-type basis set. Apart from basis set errors, this is related to the well-known shortcomings of the GW space-time method using analytical continuation techniques as well as to numerical issues of the PADF approach of accurately representing diffuse atomic orbital (AO) products. We speculate that these difficulties might be overcome by using optimized auxiliary fit sets with more diffuse functions of higher angular momenta. Despite these shortcomings, for subsets of medium and large molecules from the GW5000 database, the error of our approach using basis sets of TZ and augmented double-\u03b6 (DZ) quality is decreasing with system size. On the augmented DZ level, we reproduce canonical, complete basis set limit extrapolated reference values with an accuracy of 80 meV on average for a set of 20 large organic molecules. We anticipate our algorithm, in its current form, to be very useful in the study of single-particle properties of large organic systems such as chromophores and acceptor molecules. "

However, one major bottleneck for routine implementation and accessibility of this technology to the wider scientific community is the complexity of data analysis. To this end, we have created ProVision, a free open-source web-based analytics platform that allows users to analyze data from two common proteomics relative quantification workflows, namely label-free and tandem mass tag-based experiments. Furthermore, ProVision allows the freedom to interface with the data analysis pipeline while maintaining a user-friendly environment and providing default parameters for fast statistical and exploratory data analysis. Finally, multiple customizable quality control, differential expression plots as well as enrichments and protein-protein interaction prediction can be generated online in one platform. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Quick start and step-by-step tutorials as well as tutorial data are fully incorporated in the web application.

  "description": "A Comparative Interrupted Times Series on the Health Impact of Probiotic Yogurt Consumption Among School Children From Three to Six Years Old in Southwest UgandaIntroduction: Following a school milk feeding program in Southwest Uganda, we initiated a probiotic yogurt school feeding program in the same region in 2018. In order to investigate the potential health benefits from probiotic yogurt we conducted an observational study, where we compared the effect of the consumption of locally produced probiotic yogurt containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus yoba 2012 to milk in pre-primary schoolchildren from different schools on the occurrence of respiratory tract infections (common cold) and skin infections (e.g., tinea capitis). Method: A comparative interrupted time series over a period of 3 weeks of baseline followed by 9 weeks of 100 ml of probiotic yogurt or milk consumption for 5 days per week. In total 584 children attending five different schools were followed during consumption of probiotic yogurt and 532 children attending five other schools during consumption of milk. Incidences of respiratory tract infection symptoms and skin infection symptoms, changes in anthropometric indicators and absenteeism were recorded. Results: Over the course of the study period the incidence rate for common cold symptoms decreased faster in the yogurt group than in the milk group (p = 0.09) resulting in a final RR of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.5\u20131.4) at the end of the observational period. The incidence rate of skin infection related symptoms also reduced faster in the yogurt group compared to the milk group (p < 0.0001) resulting in a relative risk factor (RR) of 0.6 (CI: 0.4\u20130.9) at the end of the observational period. Anthropometric indicators and level of absenteeism did not show significant differences between yogurt and milk. Conclusion: Notwithstanding the observed positive trend and effect of probiotic yogurt on the incidences of common cold and skin infections, respectively, we consider the results of this comparative interrupted time series inconclusive due to differences in the recorded health parameters between the probiotic yogurt and milk control groups at base line, and fluctuations over the course of the intervention period. An improved study design, with more uniform study groups, a longer intervention period and a third control group without yogurt or milk is required to draw definitive conclusions."

  "description": "The fundamental equations of change in statistical ensembles and biological populationsA recent article in Nature Physics unified key results from thermodynamics, statistics, and information theory. The unification arose from a general equation for the rate of change in the information content of a system. The general equation describes the change in the moments of an observable quantity over a probability distribution. One term in the equation describes the change in the probability distribution. The other term describes the change in the observable values for a given state. We show the equivalence of this general equation for moment dynamics with the widely known Price equation from evolutionary theory, named after George Price. We introduce the Price equation from its biological roots, review a mathematically abstract form of the equation, and discuss the potential for this equation to unify diverse mathematical theories from different disciplines. The new work in Nature Physics and many applications in biology show that this equation also provides the basis for deriving many novel theoretical results within each discipline."

We carried out a systematic analysis of reliable global data detailing the relative abundance of polymers in freshwaters and estuaries. The polymers were identified according to seven main categories: polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyurethane and a final category of miscellaneous plastic. The results show that microplastics comprised of polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane are significantly less abundant than would be expected based on global production, possibly due to their use. This has implications for models of microplastic release into the environment based on production and fate. When analysed by matrix (water, sediment or biota) distinct profiles were obtained for each category. Polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene were more abundant in sediment than in biota, while miscellaneous plastics was more frequent in biota. The data suggest that environmental sorting of microplastic particles, influenced by physical, chemical and biological processes, may play a key role in environmental impact, although partitioning among matrices based on density was not realized. The distinct profile of microplastics in biota raises an important question regarding potential selectivity in uptake by organisms, highlighting the priority for more and better-informed laboratory exposure studies."

Viperid snakes are responsible for the majority of envenomings, but extensive interspecific variation in venom composition dictates that different antivenom treatments are used in different parts of the world, resulting in clinical and financial snakebite management challenges. Here, we show that a number of repurposed Phase 2-approved small molecules are capable of broadly neutralizing distinct viper venom bioactivities in vitro by inhibiting different enzymatic toxin families. Furthermore, using murine in vivo models of envenoming, we demonstrate that a single dose of a rationally-selected dual inhibitor combination consisting of marimastat and varespladib prevents murine lethality caused by venom from the most medically-important vipers of Africa, South Asia and Central America. Our findings support the translation of combinations of repurposed small molecule-based toxin inhibitors as broad-spectrum therapeutics for snakebite."

  "description": "Supercritical fluid chromatography \u2013 Mass spectrometry in metabolomics: Past, present, and future perspectivesMetabolomics, which consists of the comprehensive analysis of metabolites within a biological system, has been playing a growing role in the implementation of personalized medicine in modern healthcare. A wide range of analytical approaches are used in metabolomics, notably mass spectrometry (MS) combined to liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), or capillary electrophoresis (CE). However, none of these methods enable a comprehensive analysis of the metabolome, due to its extreme complexity and the large differences in physico-chemical properties between metabolite classes. In this context, supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) represents a promising alternative approach to improve the metabolome coverage, while further increasing the analysis throughput. SFC, which uses supercritical CO2 as mobile phase, leads to numerous advantages such as improved kinetic performance and lower environmental impact. This chromatographic technique has gained a significant interest since the introduction of advanced instrumentation, together with the introduction of dedicated interfaces for hyphenating SFC to MS. Moreover, new developments in SFC column chemistry (including sub-2 \u00b5m particles), as well as the use of large amounts of organic modifiers and additives in the CO2-based mobile phase, significantly extended the application range of SFC, enabling the simultaneous analysis of a large diversity of metabolites. Over the last years, several applications have been reported in metabolomics using SFC-MS \u2013 from lipophilic compounds, such as steroids and other lipids, to highly polar compounds, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, or nucleosides. With all these advantages, SFC-MS is promised to a bright future in the field of metabolomics."

  "description": "Alloy CsCd xPb1- xBr3Perovskite Nanocrystals: The Role of Surface Passivation in Preserving Composition and Blue EmissionVarious strategies have been proposed to engineer the band gap of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) while preserving their structure and composition and thus ensuring spectral stability of the emission color. An aspect that has only been marginally investigated is how the type of surface passivation influences the structural/color stability of AMX3 perovskite NCs composed of two different M2+ cations. Here, we report the synthesis of blue-emitting Cs-oleate capped CsCdxPb1-xBr3 NCs, which exhibit a cubic perovskite phase containing Cd-rich domains of Ruddlesden-Popper phases (RP phases). The RP domains spontaneously transform into pure orthorhombic perovskite ones upon NC aging, and the emission color of the NCs shifts from blue to green over days. On the other hand, postsynthesis ligand exchange with various Cs-carboxylate or ammonium bromide salts, right after NC synthesis, provides monocrystalline NCs with cubic phase, highlighting the metastability of RP domains. When NCs are treated with Cs-carboxylates (including Cs-oleate), most of the Cd2+ ions are expelled from NCs upon aging, and the NCs phase evolves from cubic to orthorhombic and their emission color changes from blue to green. Instead, when NCs are coated with ammonium bromides, the loss of Cd2+ ions is suppressed and the NCs tend to retain their blue emission (both in colloidal dispersions and in electroluminescent devices), as well as their cubic phase, over time. The improved compositional and structural stability in the latter cases is ascribed to the saturation of surface vacancies, which may act as channels for the expulsion of Cd2+ ions from NCs. "

  "description": "Recent Developments in Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) Mass Spectrometry: Application of Quantitative Analysis of the Brain ProteomeMass spectrometry is the driving force behind current brain proteome analysis. In a typical proteomics approach, a protein isolate is digested into tryptic peptides and then analyzed by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. The recent advancements in data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry provide higher sensitivity and protein coverage than the classic data dependent acquisition. DIA cycles through a pre-defined set of peptide precursor isolation windows stepping through 400\u20131,200 m/z across the whole liquid chromatography gradient. All peptides within an isolation window are fragmented simultaneously and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides are identified by matching the ion peaks in a mass spectrum to a spectral library that contains information of the peptide fragment ions' pattern and its chromatography elution time. Currently, there are several reports on DIA in brain research, in particular the quantitative analysis of cellular and synaptic proteomes to reveal the spatial and/or temporal changes of proteins that underlie neuronal plasticity and disease mechanisms. Protocols in DIA are continuously improving in both acquisition and data analysis. The depth of analysis is currently approaching proteome-wide coverage, while maintaining high reproducibility in a stable and standardisable MS environment.

  "description": "Photoinduced electron injection in a fully solvated dye-sensitized photoanode: A dynamical semiempirical studyDye-sensitized solar cells and dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells have attracted much interest in recent years for solar energy conversion. More effort is still required to increase the efficiency of these devices, which is closely linked to the crucial process of photoinduced charge separation. Computational studies can provide insights into this fundamental process and suggest molecular components and interfaces that feature optimal energy-level alignment before time-consuming trial-and-error experimental realization. Here, we use a combination of density functional based tight binding and an extended H\u00fcckel approach to perform quantum classical simulations of photoinduced electron injection in a TiO2 dye-sensitized photoanode with explicit solvation at a reasonable computational cost. In particular, we evaluate injection capabilities of core-extended naphthalene diimide (NDI) dyes with three different anchoring groups. Our results stress the importance of nuclear motion as well as conformational and trajectory sampling for a realistic description of the injection process. Furthermore, explicit solvation highly influences the conformational space explored by the dye and anchoring molecules, especially concerning the adsorption mode. Taking these effects into account, the core-extended NDI with a catechol-based anchoring moiety is shown to be the most promising ultrafast electron injector. Our strategy allows for a more systematic computational search for appropriate molecular chromophores in dye-sensitized devices for solar energy conversion."

  "description": "IUPACpal: efficient identification of inverted repeats in IUPAC-encoded DNA sequencesBackground: An inverted repeat is a DNA sequence followed downstream by its reverse complement, potentially with a gap in the centre. Inverted repeats are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and they have been linked with countless possible functions. Many international consortia provide a comprehensive description of common genetic variation making alternative sequence representations, such as IUPAC encoding, necessary for leveraging the full potential of such broad variation datasets. Results: We present IUPACpal, an exact tool for efficient identification of inverted repeats in IUPAC-encoded DNA sequences allowing also for potential mismatches and gaps in the inverted repeats. Conclusion: Within the parameters that were tested, our experimental results show that IUPACpal compares favourably to a similar application packaged with EMBOSS. We show that IUPACpal identifies many previously unidentified inverted repeats when compared with EMBOSS, and thatthis is also performed with orders of magnitude improved speed."

Aging, certain diseases and chemical-induced toxicity are factors that contribute to proximal tubule injury and chronic kidney disease progression. To better understand these processes, it would be advantageous to generate renal tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Here, we report the differentiation and characterization of iPSC lines into proximal tubular-like cells (PTL). The protocol is a step wise exposure of small molecules and growth factors, including the GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), the retinoic acid receptor activator (TTNPB), FGF9 and EGF, to drive iPSC to PTL via cell stages representing characteristics of early stages of renal development. Genome-wide RNA sequencing showed that PTL clustered within a kidney phenotype. PTL expressed proximal tubular-specific markers, including megalin (LRP2), showed a polarized phenotype, and were responsive to parathyroid hormone. PTL could take up albumin and exhibited ABCB1 transport activity. The phenotype was stable for up to 7days and was maintained after passaging. This protocol will form the basis of an optimized strategy for molecular investigations using iPSC derived PTL."

  "description": "Stimulated Raman scattering simulation for imaging optimizationTwo simulation programs of a stimulated Raman scattering microscopy (SRS) imaging system with lock-in amplifier (LIA) detection were developed. SRS is an imaging technique based on the vibrational Raman cross-section as the contrast mechanism and enables fast, label-free imaging. Most SRS implementations are based on LIA detection of a modulated signal. However, building and operating such SRS set-ups still poses a challenge when selecting the LIA parameter settings for optimized acquisition speed or image quality. Moreover, the type of sample, e.g. a sparse sample vs. a densely packed sample, the required resolution as well as the Raman cross-section and the laser powers affect the parameter choice.A simulation program was used to find these optimal parameters. The focal spot diameters of the individual lasers (pump and Stokes) were used to estimate the effective SRS signal focal spot and the (optical) spatial resolution. By calibrating the signal and noise propagation through an SRS system for a known molecule, we estimated the signal and noise input to the LIA. We used a low pass filter model to simulate the LIA behavior in order to find the optimal parameters (i.e. filter order and time constant).Optimization was done for either image quality (expressed as contrast to noise ratio) or acquisition time. The targeted object size was first determined as a measure for the required resolution. The simulation output consisted of the LIA parameters, pixel dwell time and contrast to noise ratio.In a second simulation we evaluated SRS imaging based on the same principles as the optimal setting simulation, i.e. the signals were propagated through an imaging system and LIA detection. The simulated images were compared to experimental SRS images of polystyrene beads.Finally, the same software was used to simulate multiplexed SRS imaging. In this study we modeled a six-channel frequency-encoded multiplexed SRS system demodulated with six LIA channels. We evaluated the inter-channel crosstalk as a function of chosen LIA parameters, which in multiplex SRS imaging also needs to be considered.These programs to optimize the contrast to noise ratio, acquisition speed, resolution and crosstalk will be useful for operating stimulated Raman scattering imaging setup, as well as for designing novel setups."

  "description": "Nonadditivity in public and inhouse data: implications for drug designNumerous ligand-based drug discovery projects are based on structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, such as Free-Wilson (FW) or matched molecular pair (MMP) analysis. Intrinsically they assume linearity and additivity of substituent contributions. These techniques are challenged by nonadditivity (NA) in protein\u2013ligand binding where the change of two functional groups in one molecule results in much higher or lower activity than expected from the respective single changes. Identifying nonlinear cases and possible underlying explanations is crucial for a drug design project since it might influence which lead to follow. By systematically analyzing all AstraZeneca (AZ) inhouse compound data and publicly available ChEMBL25 bioactivity data, we show significant NA events in almost every second assay among the inhouse and once in every third assay in public data sets. Furthermore, 9.4% of all compounds of the AZ database and 5.1% from public sources display significant additivity shifts indicating important SAR features or fundamental measurement errors. Using NA data in combination with machine learning showed that nonadditive data is challenging to predict and even the addition of nonadditive data into training did not result in an increase in predictivity. Overall, NA analysis should be applied on a regular basis in many areas of computational chemistry and can further improve rational drug design."

  "description": "Imaging and modelling of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) synthesis in Paracoccus denitrificansPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) granule formation in Paracoccus denitrificans Pd1222 was investigated by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and gas chromatography analysis. Cells that had been starved for 2days were free of PHB granules but resynthesized them within 30min of growth in fresh medium with succinate. In most cases, the granules were distributed randomly, although in some cases they appeared in a more organized pattern. The rates of growth and PHB accumulation were analyzed within the frame of a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GSMM) containing 781 metabolic genes, 1403 reactions and 1503 metabolites. The model was used to obtain quantitative predictions of biomass yields and PHB synthesis during aerobic growth on succinate as sole carbon and energy sources. The results revealed an initial fast stage of PHB accumulation, during which all of the acetyl-CoA originating from succinate was diverted to PHB production. The next stage was characterized by a tenfold lower PHB production rate and the simultaneous onset of exponential growth, during which acetyl-CoA was predominantly drained into the TCA cycle. Previous research has shown that PHB accumulation correlates with cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentration. It has also been shown that PHB accumulation is not transcriptionally regulated. Our results are consistent with the mentioned findings and suggest that, in absence of cell growth, most of the cellular acetyl-CoA is channeled to PHB synthesis, while during exponential growth, it is drained to the TCA cycle, causing a reduction of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool and a concomitant decrease of the synthesis of acetoacetyl-CoA (the precursor of PHB synthesis)."

  "description": "Inter-laboratory mass spectrometry dataset based on passive sampling of drinking water for non-target analysisNon-target analysis (NTA) employing high-resolution mass spectrometry is a commonly applied approach for the detection of novel chemicals of emerging concern in complex environmental samples. NTA typically results in large and information-rich datasets that require computer aided (ideally automated) strategies for their processing and interpretation. Such strategies do however raise the challenge of reproducibility between and within different processing workflows. An effective strategy to mitigate such problems is the implementation of inter-laboratory studies (ILS) with the aim to evaluate different workflows and agree on harmonized/standardized quality control procedures. Here we present the data generated during such an ILS. This study was organized through the Norman Network and included 21 participants from 11 countries. A set of samples based on the passive sampling of drinking water pre and post treatment was shipped to all the participating laboratories for analysis, using one pre-defined method and one locally (i.e. in-house) developed method. The data generated represents a valuable resource (i.e. benchmark) for future developments of algorithms and workflows for NTA experiments."

  "description": "A method for intuitively extracting macromolecular dynamics from structural disorderMacromolecular dynamics manifest as disorder in structure determination, which is subsequently accounted for by displacement parameters (also called temperature factors, or B-factors) or alternate conformations. Though B-factors contain detailed information about structural dynamics, they are the total of multiple sources of disorder, making them difficult to interpret and thus little-used in structural analysis. We report here an analytical approach for decomposing molecular disorder into a parsimonious hierarchical series of contributions, providing an intuitive basis for quantitative structural-dynamics analysis. We demonstrate the decomposition of disorder on example SARS-CoV-2 and STEAP4 structures, from both crystallographic and cryo-electron microscopy data, and reveal how understanding of the macromolecular disorder leads to deeper understanding of molecular motions and flexibility, and suggests hypotheses for molecular mechanisms."

Here we give a perspective on a promising workflow of sample preparation methods and techniques that could enable analysis of sub-micron plastics in biological matrices and discuss their application for biological fate studies of particulate plastic in organisms.

Here, we investigate three PAH molecules: fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, using ultrafast XUV and IR laser pulses. Simultaneous measurements of the ion yields, ion momenta, and electron momenta as a function of laser pulse delay allow a detailed insight into the various molecular processes. We report relaxation times for the electronically excited PAH*, PAH+* and PAH2+* states, and show the time-dependent conversion between fragmentation pathways. Additionally, using recoil-frame covariance analysis between ion images, we demonstrate that the dissociation of the PAH2+ ions favors reaction pathways involving two-body breakup and/or loss of neutral fragments totaling an even number of carbon atoms."

  "description": "Age-related susceptibility to insulin resistance arises from a combination of CPT1B decline and lipid overloadBackground: The skeletal muscle plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through the uptake of glucose from the extracellular medium in response to insulin. A number of factors are known to disrupt the normal response to insulin leading to the emergence of insulin resistance (IR). Advanced age and a high-fat diet are factors that increase the susceptibility to IR, with lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle being a key driver of this phenomenon. It is debated, however, whether lipid accumulation arises due to dietary lipid overload or from a decline of mitochondrial function. To gain insights into the interplay of diet and age in the flexibility of muscle lipid and glucose handling, we combined lipidomics, proteomics, mitochondrial function analysis and computational modelling to investigate young and aged mice on a low- or high-fat diet (HFD). Results: As expected, aged mice were more susceptible to IR when given a HFD than young mice. The HFD induced intramuscular lipid accumulation specifically in aged mice, including C18:0-containing ceramides and diacylglycerols. This was reflected by the mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation capacity, which was upregulated by the HFD in young, but not in old mice. Conspicuously, most \u03b2-oxidation proteins were upregulated by the HFD in both groups, but carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) declined in aged animals. Computational modelling traced the flux control mostly to CPT1B, suggesting a CPT1B-driven loss of flexibility to the HFD with age. Finally, in old animals, glycolytic protein levels were reduced and less flexible to the diet. Conclusion: We conclude that intramuscular lipid accumulation and decreased insulin sensitivity are not due to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction or nutritional overload alone, but rather to their combined effects. Moreover, we identify CPT1B as a potential target to counteract age-dependent intramuscular lipid accumulation and thereby IR."

  "description": "High biodiversity in a benzene-degrading nitrate-reducing culture is sustained by a few primary consumersA key question in microbial ecology is what the driving forces behind the persistence of large biodiversity in natural environments are. We studied a microbial community with more than 100 different types of species which evolved in a 15-years old bioreactor with benzene as the main carbon and energy source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. Using genome-centric metagenomics plus metatranscriptomics, we demonstrate that most of the community members likely feed on metabolic left-overs or on necromass while only a few of them, from families Rhodocyclaceae and Peptococcaceae, are candidates to degrade benzene. We verify with an additional succession experiment using metabolomics and metabarcoding that these few community members are the actual drivers of benzene degradation. As such, we hypothesize that high species richness is maintained and the complexity of a natural community is stabilized in a controlled environment by the interdependencies between the few benzene degraders and the rest of the community members, ultimately resulting in a food web with different trophic levels."

  "description": "High throughput screening of technological and biopreservation traits of a large set of wild lactic acid bacteria from Brazilian artisanal cheesesThis study aimed to evaluate technological (acidification, proteolysis, lipolysis, resistance to low pH, NaCl, and bile salts) and biopreservation (antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens) features of 1002 LAB by high throughput screening (HTS) methods. The LAB was isolated from 11 types of Brazilian artisanal cheeses (BAC) marketed in the main 5 producing regions. Remarkable intra-species variability in acidification rates have been found, which was most pronounced between isolates from Mina's artisanal cheeses, Caipira and Coalho cheeses. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Levilactobacillus brevis showed the fastest acidification rate; however, all isolates showed slower acidification rates than a lactococcal control strain (4.3 \u00d7 lower). When testing inhibitory effects, > 75% of LAB isolates could inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19095 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644. Two of these isolates, identified as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lentilactobacillus buchneri, the sterile and neutral supernatants alone, were sufficient to inhibit L. monocytogenes growth. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed the identification of functional groups based on proteolytic and lipolytic activity, osmotic stress resistance, and inhibition of L. monocytogenes. The type of cheese the isolates were recovered from influenced properties such as anti-listerial compounds and lipolytic enzyme production. The use of HTS and multivariate statistics allowed insights into a diverse set of LAB technological and biopreservation properties. These findings allow a profound knowledge of the heterogeneity of a large set of isolates, which can be further used to design starter cultures with varied and combined properties, such as biopreservation and technological features. Besides that, HTS makes it possible to analyze a vast panel of LAB strains, reducing costs and time within laboratory analysis, while avoiding the loss of information once all LAB are tested at the same time (differently from the traditional labor-intensive approach, in which a few numbers of strains is tested per time)."

  "description": "Metabolomics of sebum reveals lipid dysregulation in Parkinson\u2019s diseaseParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterised by degeneration of distinct neuronal populations, including dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Here, we use a metabolomics profiling approach to identify changes to lipids in PD observed in sebum, a non-invasively available biofluid. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyse 274 samples from participants (80 drug na\u00efve PD, 138 medicated PD and 56 well matched control subjects) and detected metabolites that could predict PD phenotype. Pathway enrichment analysis shows alterations in lipid metabolism related to the carnitine shuttle, sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. This study shows sebum can be used to identify potential biomarkers for PD."

  "description": "Overproducing the BAM complex improves secretion of difficult-to-secrete recombinant autotransporter chimerasMonomeric autotransporters have been used extensively to transport recombinant proteins or protein domains to the cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria amongst others for antigen display. Genetic fusion of such antigens into autotransporters has yielded chimeras that can be used for vaccination purposes. However, not every fusion construct is transported efficiently across the cell envelope. Problems occur in particular when the fused antigen attains a relatively complex structure in the periplasm, prior to its translocation across the outer membrane. The latter step requires the interaction with periplasmic chaperones and the BAM (\u03b2-barrel assembly machinery) complex in the outer membrane. This complex catalyzes insertion and folding of \u03b2-barrel outer membrane proteins, including the \u03b2-barrel domain of autotransporters. Here, we investigated whether the availability of periplasmic chaperones or the BAM complex is a limiting factor for the surface localization of difficult-to-secrete chimeric autotransporter constructs. Indeed, we found that overproduction of in particular the BAM complex, increases surface display of difficult-to-secrete chimeras. Importantly, this beneficial effect appeared to be generic not only for a number of monomeric autotransporter fusions but also for fusions to trimeric autotransporters. Therefore, overproduction of BAM might be an attractive strategy to improve the production of recombinant autotransporter constructs."
