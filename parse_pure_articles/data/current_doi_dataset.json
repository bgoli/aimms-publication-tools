  "description": "Assessment of oil refinery wastewater and effluent integrating bioassays, mechanistic modelling and bioavailability evaluationWater is used in petroleum oil refineries in significant volumes for cooling, steam generation and processing of raw materials. Effective water management is required at refineries to ensure their efficient and responsible operation with respect to the water environment. However, ascertaining the potential environmental risks associated with discharge of refinery effluents to receiving waters is challenging because of their compositional complexity. Recent European research and regulatory initiatives propose a more holistic approach including biological effect methods to assess complex effluents and surface water quality. The study presented here investigated potential effects of effluent composition, particularly hydrocarbons, on aquatic toxicity and was a component of a larger study assessing contaminant removal during refinery wastewater treatment (Hjort et al 2021). The evaluation of effects utilised a novel combination of mechanistic toxicity modelling based on the exposure composition, measured bioavailable hydrocarbons using biomimetic solid phase microextraction (BE-SPME), and bioassays. The results indicate that in the refinery effluent assessments measured bioavailable hydrocarbons using BE-SPME was correlated with the responses in standard bioassays. It confirms that bioassays are providing relevant data and that BE-SPME measurement, combined with knowledge of other known non-hydrocarbon toxic constituents, provide key tools for toxicity identification. Overall, the results indicate that oil refinery effluents treated in accordance to the EU Industrial Emissions Directive requirements have low to negligible toxicity to aquatic organisms and their receiving environments. Low-cost, animal-free BE-SPME represents a compelling tool for rapid effluent characterization."

  "description": "Chronic Release of Tailless Phage Particles from Lactococcus lactisLactococcus lactis strains residing in the microbial community of a complex dairy starter culture named \"Ur\"are hosts to prophages belonging to the family Siphoviridae. L. lactis strains (TIFN1 to TIFN7) showed detectable spontaneous phage production and release (109 to 1010 phage particles/ml) and up to 10-fold increases upon prophage induction, while in both cases we observed no obvious cell lysis typically described for the lytic life cycle of Siphoviridae phages. Intrigued by this phenomenon, we investigated the host-phage interaction using strain TIFN1 (harboring prophage proPhi1) as a representative. We confirmed that during the massive phage release, all bacterial cells remain viable. Further, by monitoring phage replication in vivo, using a green fluorescence protein reporter combined with flow cytometry, we demonstrated that the majority of the bacterial population (over 80%) is actively producing phage particles when induced with mitomycin C. The released tailless phage particles were found to be engulfed in lipid membranes, as evidenced by electron microscopy and lipid staining combined with chemical lipid analysis. Based on the collective observations, we propose a model of phage-host interaction in L. lactis TIFN1 where the phage particles are engulfed in membranes upon release, thereby leaving the producing host intact. Moreover, we discuss possible mechanisms of chronic, or nonlytic, release of LAB Siphoviridae phages and its impact on the bacterial host. "

  "description": "Determination of chlorinated paraffins (CPs): Analytical conundrums and the pressing need for reliable and relevant standardsThe determination of chlorinated paraffins (CPs) has posed an intractable challenge in analytical chemistry for over three decades. The combination of an as yet unspecifiable number (tens - hundreds of thousands) of individual congeners in mass produced commercial CP mixtures and the steric interactions between them, contrive to defy efforts to characterise their residual occurrences in environmental compartments, food and human tissues. However, recent advances in instrumentation (mass spectrometric detectors and nuclear magnetic resonance), combined with interlaboratory studies, have allowed a better insight into the nature of the conundrums. These include the variability of results, even between experienced laboratories when there is insufficient matching between analytical standards and occurrence profiles, the poor (or no) response of some instrumentation to some CP congener configurations (multiple terminal chlorines or < four chlorines) and the occurrence of chlorinated olefins in commercial mixtures. The findings illustrate some limitations in the existing set of commercially available standards. These include cross-contamination of some standards (complex CP mixtures), an insufficient number of single chain standards (existing ones do not fully reflect food/biota occurrences), lack of homologue group standards and unsuitability of some configurationally defined CP congeners/labelled standards (poor instrument response and a smaller likelihood of occurrence in commercial mixtures). They also indicate an underestimation in reported occurrences arising from those CPs that are unresponsive during measurement. A more extensive set of standards is suggested and while this might not be a panacea for accurate CP determination, it would reduce the layers of complexity inherent in the analysis."

  "description": "Hipsc-derived hepatocyte-like cells can be used as a model for transcriptomics-based study of chemical toxicityTraditional toxicity risk assessment approaches have until recently focussed mainly on histochemical readouts for cell death. Modern toxicology methods attempt to deduce a mechanistic understanding of pathways involved in the development of toxicity, by using transcriptomics and other big data-driven methods such as high-content screening. Here, we used a recently described optimised method to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), to assess their potential to classify hepatotoxic and non-hepatotoxic chemicals and their use in mechanistic toxicity studies. The iPSC-HLCs could accurately classify chemicals causing acute hepatocellular injury, and the transcriptomics data on treated HLCs obtained by TempO-Seq technology linked the cytotoxicity to cellular stress pathways, including oxidative stress and unfolded protein response (UPR). Induction of these stress pathways in response to amiodarone, diclofenac, and ibuprofen, was demonstrated to be concentration and time dependent. The transcriptomics data on diclofenac-treated HLCs were found to be more sensitive in detecting differentially expressed genes in response to treatment, as compared to existing datasets of other diclofenac-treated in vitro hepatocyte models. Hence iPSC-HLCs generated by transcription factor overexpression and in metabolically optimised medium appear suitable for chemical toxicity detection as well as mechanistic toxicity studies."

  "description": "Kinetic Modeling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Central Carbon Metabolism: Achievements, Limitations, and OpportunitiesCentral carbon metabolism comprises the metabolic pathways in the cell that process nutrients into energy, building blocks and byproducts. To unravel the regulation of this network upon glucose perturbation, several metabolic models have been developed for the microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These dynamic representations have focused on glycolysis and answered multiple research questions, but no commonly applicable model has been presented. This review systematically evaluates the literature to describe the current advances, limitations, and opportunities. Different kinetic models have unraveled key kinetic glycolytic mechanisms. Nevertheless, some uncertainties regarding model topology and parameter values still limit the application to specific cases. Progressive improvements in experimental measurement technologies as well as advances in computational tools create new opportunities to further extend the model scale. Notably, models need to be made more complex to consider the multiple layers of glycolytic regulation and external physiological variables regulating the bioprocess, opening new possibilities for extrapolation and validation. Finally, the onset of new data representative of individual cells will cause these models to evolve from depicting an average cell in an industrial fermenter, to characterizing the heterogeneity of the population, opening new and unseen possibilities for industrial fermentation improvement."

  "description": "Mapping the cellular response to electron transport chain inhibitors reveals selective signaling networks triggered by mitochondrial perturbationMitochondrial perturbation is a key event in chemical-induced organ toxicities that is incompletely understood. Here, we studied how electron transport chain (ETC) complex I, II, or III (CI, CII and CIII) inhibitors affect mitochondrial functionality, stress response activation, and cell viability using a combination of high-content imaging and TempO-Seq in HepG2 hepatocyte cells. CI and CIII inhibitors perturbed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial and cellular ATP levels in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion and, under conditions preventing a switch to glycolysis attenuated cell viability, whereas CII inhibitors had no effect. TempO-Seq analysis of changes in mRNA expression pointed to a shared cellular response to CI and CIII inhibition. First, to define specific ETC inhibition responses, a gene set responsive toward ETC inhibition (and not to genotoxic, oxidative, or endoplasmic reticulum stress) was identified using targeted TempO-Seq in HepG2. Silencing of one of these genes, NOS3, exacerbated the impact of CI and CIII inhibitors on cell viability, indicating its functional implication in cellular responses to mitochondrial stress. Then by monitoring dynamic responses to ETC inhibition using a HepG2 GFP reporter panel for different classes of stress response pathways and applying pathway and gene network analysis to TempO-Seq data, we looked for downstream cellular events of ETC inhibition and identified the amino acid response (AAR) as being triggered in HepG2 by ETC inhibition. Through in silico approaches we provide evidence indicating that a similar AAR is associated with exposure to mitochondrial toxicants in primary human hepatocytes. Altogether, we (i) unravel quantitative, time- and concentration-resolved cellular responses to mitochondrial perturbation, (ii) identify a gene set associated with adaptation to exposure to active ETC inhibitors, and (iii) show that ER stress and an AAR accompany ETC inhibition in HepG2 and primary hepatocytes."

The associations between plasma levels of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid\u2013derived oxylipins and body composition and cardiometabolic risk factors in young adults were assessed. Methods: Body composition, brown adipose tissue, traditional serum cardiometabolic risk factors, inflammatory markers, and a panel of 83 oxylipins were analyzed in 133 young adults (age 22.1[SD 2.2] years, 67% women). Results: Plasma levels of four omega-6 oxylipins (15-HeTrE, 5-HETE, 14,15-EpETrE, and the oxidative stress\u2013derived 8,12-iso-iPF2\u03b1-VI) correlated positively with adiposity, prevalence of metabolic syndrome, fatty liver index, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index and lipid parameters. By contrast, the plasma levels of three omega-3 oxylipins (14,15-DiHETE, 17,18-DiHETE, and 19,20-DiHDPA) were negatively correlated with adiposity, prevalence of metabolic syndrome, fatty liver index, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index, and lipid parameters. The panel of seven oxylipins predicted adiposity better than traditional inflammatory markers such as interferon gamma or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Pathway analyses revealed that individuals with obesity had higher plasma levels of omega-6 and lower plasma levels of omega-3 oxylipins than normal-weight individuals. Conclusion: Plasma levels of seven omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins may have utility as early markers of cardiometabolic risk in young adults."

  "description": "Selection for Cell Yield Does Not Reduce Overflow Metabolism in Escherichia coliOverflow metabolism is ubiquitous in nature, and it is often considered inefficient because it leads to a relatively low biomass yield per consumed carbon. This metabolic strategy has been described as advantageous because it supports high growth rates during nutrient competition. Here, we experimentally evolved bacteria without nutrient competition by repeatedly growing and mixing millions of parallel batch cultures of Escherichia coli. Each culture originated from a water-in-oil emulsion droplet seeded with a single cell. Unexpectedly we found that overflow metabolism (acetate production) did not change. Instead, the numerical cell yield during the consumption of the accumulated acetate increased as a consequence of a reduction in cell size. Our experiments and a mathematical model show that fast growth and overflow metabolism, followed by the consumption of the overflow metabolite, can lead to a higher numerical cell yield and therefore a higher fitness compared with full respiration of the substrate. This provides an evolutionary scenario where overflow metabolism can be favorable even in the absence of nutrient competition."

The computational cost for a correlated many-electron calculation is reduced to that of the self-consistent-field Hartree-Fock method, while the accuracy still reaches that of sophisticated configuration interaction based methods. In this method, the two-electron cumulant energy is measured with an information entropy associated with the Fermi-Dirac distribution of the occupation numbers. An eigenvalue equation for the orbitals is obtained, with the eigenvalues (orbital energies) connected to the occupation numbers through the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The occupation numbers for the strongly occupied orbitals are very close to the natural orbital occupation numbers from wave function methods. It covers in a single scheme the nondynamical correlation in weak or breaking bonds as well as the dynamical correlation at all distances. The method is well suited to large-scale potential energy surface calculation and molecular dynamics simulation."

  "description": "Inspecting the Solution Space of Genome-Scale Metabolic ModelsGenome-scale metabolic models are frequently used in computational biology. They offer an integrative view on the metabolic network of an organism without the need to know kinetic information in detail. However, the huge solution space which comes with the analysis of genome-scale models by using, e.g., Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) poses a problem, since it is hard to thoroughly investigate and often only an arbitrarily selected individual flux distribution is discussed as an outcome of FBA. Here, we introduce a new approach to inspect the solution space and we compare it with other approaches, namely Flux Variability Analysis (FVA) and CoPE-FBA, using several different genome-scale models of lactic acid bacteria. We examine the extent to which different types of experimental data limit the solution space and how the robustness of the system increases as a result. We find that our new approach to inspect the solution space is a good complementary method that offers additional insights into the variance of biological phenotypes and can help to prevent wrong conclusions in the analysis of FBA results."

In this work, we design and execute a high-throughput scheme to tune the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) of perylene-type dyes by functionalizing them with different ligands. This allows us to identify promising candidates which can then be used to improve the cell's efficiency. First, we investigate the accuracy of different theoretical approaches by benchmarking them against experimentally determined GSOPs. We test different methods to calculate the vertical oxidation potential, includingGWwith different levels of self-consistency, Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital energies and total energy differences. We find that there is little difference in the performance of these methods. However, we show that it is crucial to take into account solvent effects as well as the structural relaxation of the dye after oxidation. Other thermodynamic contributions are negligible. Based on this benchmark, we decide on an optimal strategy, balancing computational cost and accuracy, to screen more than 1000 dyes and identify promising candidates which could be used to construct more robust DS-PECs."

  "description": "The Reactivity of CsPbBr3Nanocrystals toward Acid/Base LigandsThe interaction of lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals with charged ligands, such as salts, zwitterions, or acid-base pairs, has been extensively documented over the past few years. On the other hand, little is known about the reactivity of perovskite nanocrystals toward neutral ligands. To fill this gap, in this work we study the interaction of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals passivated with didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDABr) toward a series of exogenous acid/base ligands using a combined computational and experimental approach. Our analysis indicates that DDABr-capped nanocrystals are inert toward most ligands, except for carboxylic, phosphonic, and sulfonic acids. In agreement with the calculations, our experimental results indicate that the higher the acidity of the ligands employed in the treatment, the more etching is observed. In detail, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (pKa = -1.8) is found to etch the nanocrystals, causing their complete degradation. On the other hand, oleic and oleylphosphonic acids (pKa 9.9 and 2, respectively) interact with surface-bound DDA molecules, causing their displacement as DDABr in various amounts, which can be as high as 40% (achieved with oleylphosphonic acid). Despite the stripping of DDA ligands, the optical properties of the nanocrystals, as well as structure and morphology, remain substantially unaffected, empirically demonstrating the defect tolerance characterizing such materials. Our study provides not only a clear overview on the interaction between perovskite nanocrystals and neutral ligands but also presents an effective ligand stripping strategy. "

There is growing interest in consuming these \u201cfunctional foods\u201d as a means to increase health and healthy ageing. However, many studies explore the effect of these foods in isolation, not as a blend of multiple functional foods. Methods: In this study, an extract containing the dried berries, fruits, and roots of members of these families was prepared, which we called Bioact\u00ae180. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was used to evaluate the effects of Bioact\u00ae180 on lifespan and health endpoints, including muscle and mitochondria structure and locomotion. Results: Exposure to the 1000\u00b5g/mL of Bioact\u00ae180 extract, containing 4% total phenols, were healthier, as observed by an increase in mean lifespan with and small but significant increase in maximal lifespan. Nematodes exposed to Bioact\u00ae180 displayed better mobility in mid-life stages as well as enhanced mitochondrial morphology, which was more comparable to younger animals, suggesting that these worms are protected to some degree from sarcopenia. Conclusions: Together, our findings reveal that Bioact\u00ae180, a blend of fruits and roots from Rosaceae, Solanaceae and Zingiberaceae family members has anti-aging effects. Bioact\u00ae180 promotes health and lifespan extension in C. elegans, corresponding to functional improvements in mobility."

In the current study, an analytical method which only needs a small amount of breast milk (100 \u03bcl) was developed and validated for six diester metabolites and three hydroxylated metabolites applying salt-induced liquid\u2013liquid extraction (SI-LLE) and dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) for sample preparation and online solid phase extraction coupled to high pressure chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (online-SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) for quantitative measurement. The final method consisted of an extraction with formic acid (FA)/acetonitrile (1:200, v/v) and a cleanup with C18 d-SPE. The final extracts were trapped on a C18 cartridge with application of a wash step of 2 ml 0.1% FA milli-Q/methanol (98:2, v/v). Method detection limits (MDLs) ranging from 21.7 ng/l for BBOEHEP to 500 ng/l for BCIPP and average recoveries ranging from 58% for 5-OH-EHDPHP to 120% for BCIPP were achieved. Thirty-three breast milk samples from the LINC (Linking EDCs in maternal Nutrition to Child health) cohort collected in three distinct areas in The Netherlands were analyzed using the validated method. BCEP, BCIPP, BCIPHPP, BDCIPP, and 5-OH-EHDPHP were not detected in any of the samples, while BBOEP was the most frequently detected metabolite with a concentration range of <MDL to l.47 ng/ml, followed by DPhP and BBOEHEP, detected in ranges of <MDL to 0.09 and <MDL to 0.027 ng/ml. The results indicated that OPEs entering the human body are only to a limited extent excreted via breast milk."

  "description": "Taxon-selective venom variation in adult and neonate Daboia russelii (Russell's Viper), and antivenom efficacyMajor variations in venom composition can occur between juvenile and adult venomous snakes. However, due to logistical constraints, antivenoms are produced using adult venoms in immunising mixtures, possibly resulting in limited neutralisation of juvenile snake venoms. Daboia russelii is one of the leading causes of snakebite death across South Asia. Its venom is potently procoagulant, causing stroke in prey animals but causing in humans consumptive coagulopathy\u2014a net anticoagulant state\u2014and sometimes death resulting from hemorrhage. In this in vitro study, we compared the venom activity of\u2014and antivenom efficacy against\u2014six 2-week-old D. russelii relative to that of their parents. Using a coagulation analyser, we quantified the relative coagulotoxicity of these venoms in human, avian, and amphibian plasma. The overall potency on human plasma was similar across all adult and neonate venoms, and SII (Serum Institute of India) antivenom was equipotent in neutralising these coagulotoxic effects. In addition, all venoms were also similar in their action upon avian plasma. In contrast, the neonate venoms were more potent on amphibian plasma, suggesting amphibians make up a larger proportion of neonate diet than adult diet. A similar venom potency in human and avian plasmas but varying selectivity for amphibian plasma suggests ontogenetic differences in toxin isoforms within the factor X or factor V activating classes, thereby providing a testable hypothesis for future transcriptomics work. By providing insights into the functional venom differences between adult and neonate D. russelii venoms, we hope to inform clinical treatment of patients envenomated by this deadly species and to shed new light on the natural history of these extremely medically important snakes."

Consistently high enantiomeric excesses and yields were obtained over a wide range of alkyl thiol pronucleophiles and electrophiles under mild reaction conditions, enabled by a novel squaramide-based bifunctional iminophosphorane catalyst. Low catalyst loadings (2.0 mol %) were achieved on a decagram scale, demonstrating the scalability of the reaction.

However, consolidation of toxicological and chemical analysis techniques to identify bioactive CECs remains challenging and laborious. In this study, we incorporate state-of-the-art identification approaches in EDA and propose a robust workflow for the high-throughput screening of CECs in environmental and human samples. Three different sample types were extracted and chemically analyzed using a single high-performance liquid chromatography HRMS method. Chemical features were annotated by suspect screening with several reference databases. Annotation quality was assessed using an automated scoring system. In parallel, the extracts were fractionated into 80 micro-fractions each covering a couple of seconds from the chromatogram run and tested for bioactivity in two bioassays. The EDA workflow prioritized and identified chemical features related to bioactive fractions with varying levels of confidence. Confidence levels were improved with the in silico software tools MetFrag and the retention time indices platform. The toxicological and chemical data quality was comparable between the use of single and multiple technical replicates. The proposed workflow incorporating EDA for feature prioritization in suspect and nontarget screening paves the way for the routine identification of CECs in a high-throughput manner."

  "description": "Analytical Nonadiabatic Couplings and Gradients within the State-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum EigensolverWe introduce several technical and analytical extensions to our recent state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE) algorithm (see Yalouz et al. Quantum Sci. Technol. 2021, 6, 024004). Motivated by the limitations of current quantum computers, the first extension consists of an efficient state-resolution procedure to find the SA-OO-VQE eigenstates, and not just the subspace spanned by them, while remaining in the equi-ensemble framework. This approach avoids expensive intermediate resolutions of the eigenstates by postponing this problem to the very end of the full algorithm. The second extension allows for the estimation of analytical gradients and nonadiabatic couplings, which are crucial in many practical situations ranging from the search of conical intersections to the simulation of quantum dynamics, in, for example, photoisomerization reactions. The accuracy of our new implementations is demonstrated on the formaldimine molecule CH2NH (a minimal Schiff base model relevant for the study of photoisomerization in larger biomolecules), for which we also perform a geometry optimization to locate a conical intersection between the ground and first-excited electronic states of the molecule.

  "description": "Density-Corrected DFT Explained: Questions and AnswersHF-DFT, the practice of evaluating approximate density functionals on Hartree-Fock densities, has long been used in testing density functional approximations. Density-corrected DFT (DC-DFT) is a general theoretical framework for identifying failures of density functional approximations by separating errors in a functional from errors in its self-consistent (SC) density. Most modern DFT calculations yield highly accurate densities, but important characteristic classes of calculation have large density-driven errors, including reaction barrier heights, electron affinities, radicals and anions in solution, dissociation of heterodimers, and even some torsional barriers. Here, the HF density (if not spin-contaminated) usually yields more accurate and consistent energies than those of the SC density. We use the term DC(HF)-DFT to indicate DC-DFT using HF densities only in such cases. A recent comprehensive study (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2021, 17, 1368-1379) of HF-DFT led to many unfavorable conclusions. A reanalysis using DC-DFT shows that DC(HF)-DFT substantially improves DFT results precisely when SC densities are flawed."

  "description": "Analytical strategies in venomicsSnakebite envenoming is a major issue in certain developing parts of the world, with tens of thousands of deaths and a multitude of lingering permanent medical conditions on a yearly basis as a result. Venoms consist of a plethora of biologically active compounds, mainly peptides and proteins, that can induce these effects. Snake venom characterisation, in terms of identifying and quantifying the venom toxin proteins in crude venoms, can aid in pinpointing the venom toxins responsible for pathologies observed in snakebite victims. It can also assist in developing a new generation of efficient antivenoms. To facilitate this characterisation process, several approaches have been developed, of which venomics, toxicovenomics and antivenomics are the most important ones and aim to map venom toxin composition, their toxic effects, and antivenom efficacy, respectively. Most venomics approaches include peptide-centric analyses of protein digests in combination with advanced separation and detection hardware and involve the use of generic and dedicated software tools for data processing. However, a shift towards protein-level, and even proteoform-level, analysis can be observed over the last few years. A variety of hyphenated intact protein separation techniques, including gel-eluted liquid fraction entrapment electrophoresis, OFFGEL, gel filtration and several (ultra)high pressure and nanoscale chromatographic separations can be named, which allow retention of intact or native states of toxin proteins with ever increasing resolutions. Similarly, rapid detection hardware advances on the mass spectrometry side, and labelling techniques, allow for increasingly sensitive and quantitative venom analysis and characterisation. Most venomics research includes several complementary analytical techniques performed in parallel, with each technique often leading to exclusive protein identifications but also showing significant overlap. The original venomics approach, developed by the Calvete group and termed \u201cSnake venomics\u201d, is used most frequently and is the most profound methodology that has been advanced over the years, thereby resulting in sequentially further identification of venom toxin proteins based on previous results using increasingly in-depth characterisation approaches. The latest advances in this regard nowadays allow for quantitative analysis of all venom toxins in crude venoms, named \u201cAbsolute venomics\u201d. This review will focus on the analytical aspects of venomics for which sample preparation, separation, detection and quantitation techniques are discussed. Finally, a comparison between recently published venomics studies is made."

We outline cases where chemical modification of the peptide library has already been used in mRNA display, and survey opportunities to expand this using examples from DNA-encoded small molecule libraries. We also propose potential opportunities for encoding such reactions within the mRNA/cDNA tag of an mRNA-displayed peptide library to allow a more diversity-oriented approach to library modification.

  "description": "Absorbing knowledge from an emerging field: The role of interfacing by proponents in big pharmaEngaging with knowledge from an emerging field, with its promises and limitations still uncertain, can be challenging for incumbent firms. Proponents of novel technologies within these firms then play an important role in bridging the developments in the field with the rest of the firm. In this study, we explore how researchers in big pharma firms engaged with knowledge from a promising, yet once-speculative approach called fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD). To set the context, we mapped the publications and drugs in clinical trials coming from this approach across big pharma firms. Through our unique access to researchers in two big pharma firms (an early and a late adopter), we conducted a case study to explore how researchers built the capability within their firms. We find that at each stage of knowledge absorption (search and recognize value, assimilate, acquire, transform and exploit), proponents perform both internal- and external-facing activities to overcome uncertainties with regards to the field. We find that the emphasis of these activities evolves over time as the field evolves. In the early days of the field, proponents of the approach motivated knowledge absorption by emphasizing the internal needs of the firm. As the field matured, with its value becoming increasingly known, proponents lean on the exciting developments in the field to motivate further the adoption of the technology. In general, we find that proponents strategically tuned their external activities to cater to their internal context and similarly, adapted their internal activities to reflect external developments. By exploring interfacing in an emerging field, this study provides insights into how practitioners in large incumbent firms can adapt to the emergence of novel technologies."

  "description": "Assessment of four rounds of interlaboratory tests within the UNEP-coordinated POPs projectsSince 2005, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has supported developing countries with capacity building, including on-site training courses and provision on laboratory materials and consumables, and analysis of samples from Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean (GRULAC) in designated expert laboratories. In order to check the performance of laboratories analyzing persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and giving trust into chemical analytical results, four rounds of interlaboratory assessments (ILs) were organized between 2010 and 2019. These were open to all POPs laboratories. In total, 41 575 z-scores, as indicators of performance, were generated in these four ILs; of these, 8 912 were from laboratories in countries supported by UNEP projects and 3 923 were from expert laboratories; these together constitute 31% of the total. 69% of all z-scores came from laboratories not participating in the UNEP projects, especially from China, who recognized the importance of such exercises for quality control at an early stage. The results showed that POPs analytical capacity has increased over the years, but some gaps could not be closed especially not when LC-MS/MS equipment is essential such as for PFAS and congener-specific HBCD. Use of mass spectrometers provides better results than ECD instruments due to the broad spectrum of organochlorine pesticides to be analyzed under the Stockholm Convention. The main conclusion for all laboratories is that interlaboratory assessments provide important and objective snapshots of performance for the laboratories themselves and for external clients. The methods used in any interlaboratory testing should be the same as during routine analysis between such tests."

Matthias Bickelhaupt at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Radboud University Nijmegen. The cover picture shows the four primary interaction components (hydrogen bonding, cross-terms, base stacking, and solvation) that determine the stability of B-DNA duplexes. Quantum chemical analyses identify an interplay between the stabilizing hydrogen bonds between nucleotides that drive the formation of the DNA double-strand, and the destabilizing loss of stacking interactions within individual strands combined with partial desolvation. The sequence-dependence in the duplex stability originates mainly from the cross-terms, which can be attractive or repulsive. Read the full text of their Research Article at 10.1002/open.202100231."

  "description": "Stapling of Peptides Potentiates: The Antibiotic Treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii In VivoThe rising incidence of multidrug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria underlines the urgency for novel treatment options. One promising new approach is the synergistic combination of antibiotics with antimicrobial peptides. However, the use of such peptides is not straightforward; they are often sensitive to proteolytic degradation, which greatly limits their clinical potential. One approach to increase stability is to apply a hydrocarbon staple to the antimicrobial peptide, thereby fixing them in an \u03b1-helical conformation, which renders them less exposed to proteolytic activity. In this work we applied several different hydrocarbon staples to two previously described peptides shown to act on the outer membrane, L6 and L8, and tested their activity in a zebrafish embryo infection model using a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii as a pathogen. We show that the introduction of such a hydrocarbon staple to the peptide L8 improves its in vivo potentiating activity on antibiotic treatment, without increasing its in vivo antimicrobial activity, toxicity or hemolytic activity."

Here, we summarise how metabolic models are being used to address the challenges in safety, biotransformation and food enhancement in food-relevant settings.

  "description": "How Solvation Influences the SN2 versus E2 CompetitionWe have quantum chemically investigated how solvation influences the competition between the SN2 and E2 pathways of the model F- + C2H5Cl reaction. The system is solvated in a stepwise manner by going from the gas phase, then via microsolvation of one to three explicit solvent molecules, then last to bulk solvation using relativistic density functional theory at (COSMO)-ZORA-OLYP/QZ4P. We explain how and why the mechanistic pathway of the system shifts from E2 in the gas phase to SN2 upon strong solvation of the Lewis base (i.e., nucleophile/protophile). The E2 pathway is preferred under weak solvation of the system by dichloromethane, whereas a switch in reactivity from E2 to SN2 is observed under strong solvation by water. Our activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that solvation of the Lewis base has a significant impact on the strength of the Lewis base. We show how strong solvation furnishes a weaker Lewis base that is unable to overcome the high characteristic distortivity associated with the E2 pathway, and thus the SN2 pathway becomes viable. "

  "description": "Field-flow fractionation for molecular-interaction studies of labile and complex systems: A critical reviewAsymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) has attracted considerable attention as a size-based separation technique, due to its mild separation conditions, broad working range (from approximately 103 to 109 Da molecular mass or from 1 nm to 1 \u03bcm particle diameter), and versatility. AF4 is primarily being used to measure particle size, polydispersity, and physical stability of various systems, such as (bio)-macromolecules and nanoparticles. In comparison with size-exclusion chromatography (packed column), AF4 (open channel) allows separation while preserving labile structures. Monitoring of interactions between different compounds and in very complex matrices is possible. Preservation of the structure and correlation of structural characteristics with activity and functionality can bolster the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases and new materials with improved properties. In this review, a detailed overview is presented of developments in AF4 for interaction studies between various systems, such as protein-protein, polymer-polymer, nanoparticle-drug, and nanoparticle-protein. The prospects and obstacles for AF4, and other less-commonly used types of FFF, for studying interactions within complex and fragile systems are covered. Coupling AF4 to a variety of detection systems can greatly contribute to the understanding of the interaction/association processes and provide information on the interaction kinetics. This review is intended to provide comprehensive documentation on the types of information (structural, morphological, chemical) on molecular interactions that can be retrieved by AF4."

Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with ultraviolet (UV) detection was used for detection and quantification. Recoveries for PET-spiked sand samples were 99 \u00b1 2% (1 mg/L) and 93 \u00b1 7% (30 mg/L). The limit of quantification (LOQ) for PET was 0.4 \u03bcg/g for sand, 1 mg/g for indoor dust and 0.2 \u03bcg/g for wet sludge. This method was applied to seven beach sand samples, 20 indoor dust samples and one sewage sludge sample. PET MNPs levels in sand samples were all below the limit of detection (LOD) of LC-UV (0.1 \u03bcg/g). The concentrations of PET MNPs in indoor dust samples ranged from 1.2 to 305 mg/g and the PET MNPs in liquid sludge was 1.5 mg/L."

  "description": "Whole-cell modeling in yeast predicts compartment-specific proteome constraints that drive metabolic strategiesWhen conditions change, unicellular organisms rewire their metabolism to sustain cell maintenance and cellular growth. Such rewiring may be understood as resource re-allocation under cellular constraints. Eukaryal cells contain metabolically active organelles such as mitochondria, competing for cytosolic space and resources, and the nature of the relevant cellular constraints remain to be determined for such cells. Here, we present a comprehensive metabolic model of the yeast cell, based on its full metabolic reaction network extended with protein synthesis and degradation reactions. The model predicts metabolic fluxes and corresponding protein expression by constraining compartment-specific protein pools and maximising growth rate. Comparing model predictions with quantitative experimental data suggests that under glucose limitation, a mitochondrial constraint limits growth at the onset of ethanol formation-known as the Crabtree effect. Under sugar excess, however, a constraint on total cytosolic volume dictates overflow metabolism. Our comprehensive model thus identifies condition-dependent and compartment-specific constraints that can explain metabolic strategies and protein expression profiles from growth rate optimisation, providing a framework to understand metabolic adaptation in eukaryal cells."

Hammett analysis of 2,6-diarylphenylboronic acids reveals that their Lewis acidity remains unchanged upon the introduction of EWG/EDG at the distant para position of the flanking aromatic rings. Structural and computational studies demonstrate that polar-\u03c0 interactions and solvation effects contribute to the stabilization of boronic acids and boronate forms by aromatic rings. Our physical-organic chemistry work highlights that boronic acids and boronates can be stabilized by aromatic systems, leading to an important molecular knowledge for rational design and development of boronic acid-based catalysts and inhibitors of biomedically important proteins."

  "description": "Plasma Levels of Bile Acids Are Related to Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Young AdultsCONTEXT: Bile acids (BA) are known for their role in intestinal lipid absorption and can also play a role as signaling molecules to control energy metabolism. Prior evidence suggests that alterations in circulating BA levels and in the pool of circulating BA are linked to an increased risk of obesity and a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged adults. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association between plasma levels of BA with cardiometabolic risk factors in a cohort of well-phenotyped, relatively healthy young adults. METHODS: Body composition, brown adipose tissue, serum classical cardiometabolic risk factors, and a set of 8 plasma BA (including glyco-conjugated forms) in 136 young adults (age 22.1 \u00b1 2.2 years, 67% women) were measured. RESULTS: Plasma levels of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) were higher in men than in women, although these differences disappeared after adjusting for body fat percentage. Furthermore, cholic acid (CA), CDCA, deoxycholic acid (DCA), and glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA) levels were positively, yet weakly associated, with lean body mass (LBM) levels, while GDCA and glycolithocholic acid (GLCA) levels were negatively associated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by brown adipose tissue. Interestingly, glycocholic acid (GCA), glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), and GUDCA were positively associated with glucose and insulin serum levels, HOMA index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-8 levels, but negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ApoA1, and adiponectin levels, yet these significant correlations partially disappeared after the inclusion of LBM as a confounder. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that plasma levels of BA might be sex dependent and are associated with cardiometabolic and inflammatory risk factors in young and relatively healthy adults."

  "description": "Using comprehensive lipid profiling to study effects of PFHxS during different stages of early zebrafish developmentPFHxS (Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid) is one of the short-chain perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) which are widely used in many industrial and consumer applications. However, limited information is available on the molecular mechanism of PFHxS toxicity (e.g. lipid metabolism). This study provides in-depth information on the lipid regulation of zebrafish embryos with and without PFHxS exposure. Lipid changes throughout zebrafish development (4 to 120 h post fertilization (hpf)) were closely associated with lipid species and lipid composition (fatty acyl chains). A comprehensive lipid analysis of four different PFHxS exposures (0, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 \u03bcM) at different zebrafish developmental stages (24, 48, 72, and 120 hpf) was performed. Data on exposure concentration, lipids, and developmental stage showed that all PFHxS concentrations dysregulated the lipid metabolism and these were developmental-dependent. The pattern of significantly changed lipids revealed that PFHxS caused effects related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Oxidative stress and inflammation caused the remodeling of glycerophospholipid (phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)), with increased incorporation of omega-3 PUFA and a decreased incorporation of omega-6 PUFA."

  "description": "Comparing the nature of quantum plasmonic excitations for closely spaced silver and gold dimersIn the new field of quantum plasmonics, plasmonic excitations of silver and gold nanoparticles are utilized to manipulate and control light-matter interactions at the nanoscale. While quantum plasmons can be described with atomistic detail using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (DFT), such studies are computationally challenging due to the size of the nanoparticles. An efficient alternative is to employ DFT without approximations only for the relatively fast ground state calculations and use tight-binding approximations in the demanding linear response calculations. In this work, we use this approach to investigate the nature of plasmonic excitations under the variation of the separation distance between two nanoparticles. We thereby provide complementary characterizations of these excitations in terms of Kohn-Sham single-orbital transitions, intrinsic localized molecular fragment orbitals, scaling of the electron-electron interactions, and probability of electron tunneling between monomers."

Recently, the geometric energy offset (GEO) framework based on a single and natural measure for quantifying and analyzing these errors has been proposed (J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2020, 11, 99579964). An accurate and far less costly approximation to GEO is utilized here to readily quantify errors in main-group structures and analyze them in a chemically intuitive way. The use of semiexperimental geometries as a reference further simplifies the analysis. The analysis reveals new insights into the geometric performance of methods, their rankings, as well as patterns across different classes of methods and basis sets that arise from the analysis."

  "description": "Adaptive changes of sediment microbial communities associated with cleanup of oil spills in Nigerian mangrove forestsThe objectives of this study were to assess the influence on microbial communities resulting from i) the physical removal of free oil (pre-treatment or post-treatment), and ii) the level of oiling within a contaminated former mangrove forest. Sediment samples were collected before and after the removal of free oil. Before the process of remediation, a highly biodiverse mangrove microbiome which had adapted to history of recurring oil spills was observed. After removing the surface oil, the microbial diversity of the sediments reduced, with members of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria becoming dominant. This indicates that while water flushing reduced overall microbial diversity, it stimulated the growth of a more specialized bacterial community reported to be involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation. These results provide new insights on microbial communities and their succession in mangrove forest sediments, that will be useful for monitoring oil cleaning programs using water flushing to remove free oil."

In this work, we accurately evaluate these density functionals and we extract second-order gradient coefficients from the data for neutral atoms, following ideas similar to the ones used in the literature for exchange, with some modifications. These new gradient expansions will be the key ingredient for performing interpolations that have already been shown to reduce dramatically MP2 errors for large noncovalent complexes. As a byproduct, our investigation of neutral atoms with large number of electrons N indicates that the second-order gradient expansion for exchange grows as N log(N) rather than as N, as often reported in the literature."

  "description": "Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Interstellar Ices:A Computational Study into How the Ice Matrix Influences the Ionic State of PAH PhotoproductsIt has been experimentally observed that water-ice-embedded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) form radical cations when exposed to vacuum UV irradiation, whereas ammonia-embedded PAHs lead to the formation of radical anions. In this study, we explain this phenomenon by investigating the fundamental electronic differences between water and ammonia, the implications of these differences on the PAH-water and PAH-ammonia interaction, and the possible ionization pathways in these complexes using density functional theory (DFT) computations. In the framework of the Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (MO) theory, we show that the ionic state of the PAH photoproducts results from the degree of occupied-occupied MO mixing between the PAHs and the matrix molecules. When interacting with the PAH, the lone pair-type highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of water has poor orbital overlap and is too low in energy to mix with the filled \u03c0-orbitals of the PAH. As the lone-pair HOMO of ammonia is significantly higher in energy and has better overlap with filled \u03c0-orbitals of the PAH, the subsequent Pauli repulsion leads to mixed MOs with both PAH and ammonia character. By time-dependent DFT calculations, we demonstrate that the formation of mixed PAH-ammonia MOs opens alternative charge-transfer excitation pathways as now electronic density from ammonia can be transferred to unoccupied PAH levels, yielding anionic PAHs. As this pathway is much less available for water-embedded PAHs, charge transfer mainly occurs from localized PAH MOs to mixed PAH-water virtual levels, leading to cationic PAHs."

  "description": "PIPENN: protein interface prediction from sequence with an ensemble of neural netsMotivation: The interactions between proteins and other molecules are essential to many biological and cellular processes. Experimental identification of interface residues is a time-consuming, costly and challenging task, while protein sequence data are ubiquitous. Consequently, many computational and machine learning approaches have been developed over the years to predict such interface residues from sequence. However, the effectiveness of different Deep Learning (DL) architectures and learning strategies for protein-protein, protein-nucleotide and protein-small molecule interface prediction has not yet been investigated in great detail. Therefore, we here explore the prediction of protein interface residues using six DL architectures and various learning strategies with sequence-derived input features. Results: We constructed a large dataset dubbed BioDL, comprising protein-protein interactions from the PDB, and DNA/RNA and small molecule interactions from the BioLip database. We also constructed six DL architectures, and evaluated them on the BioDL benchmarks. This shows that no single architecture performs best on all instances. An ensemble architecture, which combines all six architectures, does consistently achieve peak prediction accuracy. We confirmed these results on the published benchmark set by Zhang and Kurgan (ZK448), and on our own existing curated homo- and heteromeric protein interaction dataset. Our PIPENN sequence-based ensemble predictor outperforms current state-of-the-art sequence-based protein interface predictors on ZK448 on all interaction types, achieving an AUC-ROC of 0.718 for protein-protein, 0.823 for protein-nucleotide and 0.842 for protein-small molecule."

  "description": "Efficient Computation of Sequence MappabilitySequence mappability is an important task in genome resequencing. In the (k,m)-mappability problem, for a given sequence T of length n, the goal is to compute a table whose ith entry is the number of indices j\u2260 i such that the length-m substrings of T starting at positions i and j have at most k mismatches. Previous works on this problem focused on heuristics computing a rough approximation of the result or on the case of k= 1. We present several efficient algorithms for the general case of the problem. Our main result is an algorithm that, for k= O(1) , works in O(n) space and, with high probability, in O(n\u00b7 min { mk, log kn}) time. Our algorithm requires a careful adaptation of the k-errata trees of Cole et al.[STOC 2004] to avoid multiple counting of pairs of substrings. Our technique can also be applied to solve the all-pairs Hamming distance problem introduced by Crochemore et al.[WABI 2017]. We further develop O(n2) -time algorithms to compute all (k,m)-mappability tables for a fixed m and all k\u2208 { 0 , \u2026 , m} or a fixed k and all m\u2208 { k, \u2026 , n}. Finally, we show that, for k, m= \u0398 (log n) , the (k,m)-mappability problem cannot be solved in strongly subquadratic time unless the Strong Exponential TimeHypothesisfails. This is an improved and extended version of a paper presented at SPIRE 2018."

  "description": "Getting more out of the zebrafish light dark transition testIn (eco-)toxicological studies the light/dark transition (LDT) test is one of the most frequently used behaviour assays with zebrafish eleutheroembryos. However, study results vary regarding data presentation and analysis and mostly focus on a limited amount of the recorded data. In this study, we investigated whether monitoring two behavioural outcomes (time and distance moved) together with analysing multiple parameters can improve test sensitivity and data interpretation. As a proof of principle 5-day old zebrafish (Danio rerio) eleutheroembryos exposed to either endocrine disruptors (EDs) or acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibitors were investigated. We analysed conventional parameters such as mean and sum and implemented additional endpoints such as minimum or maximum distance moved and new parameters assessing the bursting response of eleutheroembryos. Furthermore, changes in eleutheroembryonic behaviour during the moment of the light to dark transition were added. To improve data presentation control-normalised results were displayed in radar charts, enabling the simultaneous presentation of different parameters in relation to each other. This enabled us to identify parameters most relevant to a certain behavioural response. A cut off threshold using control data was applied to identify parameters that were altered in a biological relevant manner. Our approach was able to detect effects on different parameters that remained undetected when analysis was done using conventional bar graphs on - in most cases analysed - averaged, mean distance moved values. By combining the radar charts with additional parameters and by using control-based thresholds, we were able to increase the test sensitivity and promote a deeper understanding of the behaviour response of zebrafish eleutheroembryos in the LDT test and thereby increased its usability for behavioural toxicity studies."

  "description": "Innovations in analytical methods to assess the occurrence of microplastics in soilThe occurrence of microplastics (MPs, particles <5 mm) in the environment has raised concerns globally due to their extensive use, slow degradation, low recycling rates, and potential risks to the ecosystem and human health. In the last decade, research on MPs in soil ecosystems has increased but is relatively limited compared to studies on MPs in aquatic environments. The soil matrix complexity and the ubiquitous presence of MPs in the environment make the analytical method development, validation, and Quality Assurance/ Quality Control (QA/QC) procedures challenging to analyze MPs in soil. This review paper comprehensively summarizes the emerging techniques and state-of-the-art methods for extracting, analyzing, and characterizing MPs in soil. The choice in analytical technique ultimately relies on the research objectives, whether polymer type, morphological information, quantity, or the presence of MPs in soil is of interest. Among the reviewed studies, globally, a broad range of concentrations (up to 6.9 \u00d7 105 particles/kg) of MPs was observed. However, the data was mainly limited to China. Lastly, the validation of analytical methods, QA/QC procedures, and recommendations for future research are addressed. There are no standardized methods to analyze MPs in soil and validate analytical processes, making it difficult to compare methods and results among studies, resulting in large differences in reported results between laboratories participating in interlaboratory studies. This indicates a need to improve and further develop more robust and efficient analytical techniques for analyzing MPs in soil, conduct more interlaboratory studies, manufacture and use certified reference materials, and promote large-scale monitoring research globally.

  "description": "Targeting the ATP synthase in bacterial and fungal pathogens: beyond Mycobacterium tuberculosisThe ATP synthase is a multicomponent enzyme that is largely conserved across the kingdoms of life. In many species the ATP synthase is central in the synthesis of ATP by using the electrochemical proton gradient generated via the electron transport chain. Bacteria inhabit very diverse ecological niches; hence their metabolism to extract nutrients and generation of ATP varies from species to species. Some species are obligate aerobes (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis), relying on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP synthesis, whereas others are strict anaerobes (e.g., Clostridioides difficile) relying primarily on substrate-level phosphorylation using various fermentative pathways. Yet other species, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli are facultative anaerobes and can convert energy via both respiratory and fermentative pathways. The metabolic propensity and growth conditions experienced by bacterial species have a great impact on the necessity of a functional ATP synthase for viability. The ATP synthase has been validated as a druggable target with the approval of the ATP synthase inhibitor bedaquiline for treatment of M. tuberculosis, an organism in which the ATP synthase is essential for growth. Currently, no ATP synthase inhibitors are in clinical use against non-mycobacterial pathogens. In this review, the physiological functions of the ATP synthase in various bacterial pathogens are discussed in relation to the metabolic pathways utilized for providing energy. The ATP synthase is essential in important pathogenic species that are obligate aerobes, obligate anaerobes and aerotolerant anaerobes, whereas it is dispensable for growth in most facultative anaerobic pathogens. Interference with the ATP synthase in facultative anaerobes has physiological consequences, such as membrane hyperpolarization, which can be exploited for combination therapies. Collectively, the available data indicate that the ATP synthase is an interesting target for development of new antimicrobials beyond M. tuberculosis."

  "description": "Escherichia coli robustly expresses ATP synthase at growth rate-maximizing concentrationsFitness-enhancing adaptations of protein expression and its regulation are an important aspect of bacterial evolution. A key question is whether evolution has led to optimal protein expression that maximizes immediate growth rate (short-term fitness) in a robust manner (consistently across diverse conditions). Alternatively, they could display suboptimal short-term fitness, because they cannot do better or because they instead strive for long-term fitness maximization by, for instance, preparing for future conditions. To address this question, we focus on the ATP-producing enzyme F1F0 H+-ATPase, which is an abundant enzyme and ubiquitously expressed across conditions. Its expression is highly regulated and dependent on growth rate and nutrient conditions. For instance, during growth on sugars, when metabolism is overflowing acetate, glycolysis supplies most ATP, while H+-ATPase is the main source of ATP synthesis during growth on acetate. We tested the optimality of H+-ATPase expression in Escherichia coli across different nutrient conditions. In all tested conditions, wild-type E. coli expresses its H+-ATPase remarkably close (within a few per cent) to optimal concentrations that maximize immediate growth rate. This work indicates that bacteria can indeed achieve robust optimal protein expression for immediate growth-rate maximization."

  "description": "Combining Photodegradation in a Liquid-Core-Waveguide Cell with Multiple-Heart-Cut Two-Dimensional Liquid ChromatographyPhotodegradation greatly affects everyday life. It poses challenges when food deteriorates or when objects of cultural heritage fade, but it can also create opportunities applied in advanced oxidation processes in water purification. Studying photodegradation, however, can be difficult because of the time needed for degradation, the inaccessibility of pure compounds, and the need to handle samples manually. A novel light-exposure cell, based on liquid-core-waveguide (LCW) technology, was embedded in a multiple-heart-cut two-dimensional liquid chromatography system by coupling the LCW cell to the multiple-heart-cut valve. The sample was flushed from the heart-cut loops into the cell by an isocratic pump. Samples were then irradiated using different time intervals and subsequently transferred by the same isocratic pump to a second-dimension sample loop. The mixture containing the transformation products was then subjected to the second-dimension separation. In the current setup, about 30-40% of the selected fraction was transferred. Multiple degradation products could be monitored. Degradation was found to be faster when a smaller sample amount was introduced (0.3 \u03bcg as compared to 1.5 \u03bcg). The system was tested with three applications, that is, fuchsin, a 19th-century synthetic organic colorant, annatto, a lipophilic food dye, and vitamin B complex."

  "description": "ENT-A010, a Novel Steroid Derivative, Displays Neuroprotective Functions and Modulates Microglial ResponsesTackling neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is particularly challenging due to the complexity of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, as well as the limited drug accessibility to the brain. The activation of tropomyosin-related kinase A (TRKA) receptor signaling by the nerve growth factor (NGF) or the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may combat neurodegeneration and regulate microglial function. In the present study, we synthesized a C-17-spiro-cyclopropyl DHEA derivative (ENT-A010), which was capable of activating TRKA. ENT-A010 protected PC12 cells against serum starvation-induced cell death, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons against NGF deprivation-induced apoptosis and hippocampal neurons against A\u03b2-induced apoptosis. In addition, ENT-A010 pretreatment partially restored homeostatic features of microglia in the hippocampus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, enhanced A\u03b2 phagocytosis, and increased Ngf expression in microglia in vitro. In conclusion, the small molecule ENT-A010 elicited neuroprotective effects and modulated microglial function, thereby emerging as an interesting compound, which merits further study in the treatment of CNS disorders."

  "description": "Integrate mechanistic evidence from new approach methodologies (NAMs) into a read-across assessment to characterise trends in shared mode of actionRead-across approaches often remain inconclusive as they do not provide sufficient evidence on a common mode of action across the category members. This read-across case study on thirteen, structurally similar, branched aliphatic carboxylic acids investigates the concept of using human-based new approach methods, such as in vitro and in silico models, to demonstrate biological similarity. Five out of the thirteen analogues have preclinical in vivo studies. Three out of them induced lipid accumulation or hypertrophy in preclinical studies with repeated exposure, which leads to the read-across hypothesis that the analogues can potentially induce hepatic steatosis. To confirm the selection of analogues, the expression patterns of the induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analysed in a human liver model. With increasing dose, the expression pattern within the tested analogues got more similar, which serves as a first indication of a common mode of action and suggests differences in the potency of the analogues. Hepatic steatosis is a well-known adverse outcome, for which over 55 adverse outcome pathways have been identified. The resulting adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network, comprised a total 43 MIEs/KEs and enabled the design of an in vitro testing battery. From the AOP network, ten MIEs, early and late KEs were tested to systematically investigate a common mode of action among the grouped compounds. The targeted testing of AOP specific MIE/KEs shows that biological activity in the category decreases with side chain length. A similar trend was evident in measuring liver alterations in zebra fish embryos. However, activation of single MIEs or early KEs at in vivo relevant doses did not necessarily progress to the late KE \u201clipid accumulation\u201d. KEs not related to the read-across hypothesis, testing for example general mitochondrial stress responses in liver cells, showed no trend or biological similarity. Testing scope is a key issue in the design of in vitro test batteries. The Dempster-Shafer decision theory predicted those analogues with in vivo reference data correctly using one human liver model or the CALUX reporter assays. The case study shows that the read-across hypothesis is the key element to designing the testing strategy. In the case of a good mechanistic understanding, an AOP facilitates the selection of reliable human in vitro models to demonstrate a common mode of action. Testing DEGs, MIEs and early KEs served to show biological similarity, whereas the late KEs become important for confirmation, as progression from MIEs to AO is not always guaranteed."

  "description": "BRET-Based Biosensors to Measure Agonist Efficacies in Histamine H1 Receptor-Mediated G Protein Activation, Signaling and Interactions with GRKs and \u03b2-ArrestinsThe histamine H1 receptor (H1R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and plays a key role in allergic reactions upon activation by histamine which is locally released from mast cells and basophils. Consequently, H1R is a well-established therapeutic target for antihistamines that relieve allergy symptoms. H1R signals via heterotrimeric Gq proteins and is phosphorylated by GPCR kinase (GRK) subtypes 2, 5, and 6, consequently facilitating the subsequent recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin1 and/or 2. Stimulation of a GPCR with structurally different agonists can result in preferential engagement of one or more of these intracellular signaling molecules. To evaluate this so-called biased agonism for H1R, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensors were applied to measure H1R signaling through heterotrimeric Gq proteins, second messengers (inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and Ca2+), and receptor-protein interactions (GRKs and \u03b2-arrestins) in response to histamine, 2-phenylhistamines, and histaprodifens in a similar cellular background. Although differences in efficacy were observed for these agonists between some functional readouts as compared to reference agonist histamine, subsequent data analysis using an operational model of agonism revealed only signaling bias of the agonist Br-phHA-HA in recruiting \u03b2-arrestin2 to H1R over Gq biosensor activation."

The \u2018highest\u2019 methylation mark, N\u03b5-trimethyllysine, is specifically recognised by N\u03b5-trimethyllysine binding \u2018reader\u2019 domains, and undergoes demethylation, as catalysed by 2-oxoglutarate dependent JmjC oxygenases. We report studies on the recognition of the closest positively charged N\u03b5-trimethyllysine analogue, i.e. its trimethylphosphonium derivative (KPme3), by N\u03b5-trimethyllysine histone binding proteins and N\u03b5-trimethyllysine demethylases. Calorimetric and computational studies with histone binding proteins reveal that H3KP4me3 binds more tightly than the natural H3K4me3 substrate, though the relative differences in binding affinity vary. Studies with JmjC demethylases show that some, but not all, of themcan accept the phosphonium analogue of their natural substrates and that the methylation state selectivity can be changed by substitution of nitrogen for phosphorus. The combined results reveal that very subtle changes, e.g. substitution of nitrogen for phosphorus, can substantially affect interactions between ligand and reader domains / demethylases, knowledge that we hope will inspire the development of highly selective small molecules modulating their activity."

  "description": "One planet: one health. A call to support the initiative on a global science\u2013policy body on chemicals and wasteThe chemical pollution crisis severely threatens human and environmental health globally. To tackle this challenge the establishment of an overarching international science\u2013policy body has recently been suggested. We strongly support this initiative based on the awareness that humanity has already likely left the safe operating space within planetary boundaries for novel entities including chemical pollution. Immediate action is essential and needs to be informed by sound scientific knowledge and data compiled and critically evaluated by an overarching science\u2013policy interface body. Major challenges for such a body are (i) to foster global knowledge production on exposure, impacts and governance going beyond data-rich regions (e.g., Europe and North America), (ii) to cover the entirety of hazardous chemicals, mixtures and wastes, (iii) to follow a one-health perspective considering the risks posed by chemicals and waste on ecosystem and human health, and (iv) to strive for solution-oriented assessments based on systems thinking. Based on multiple evidence on urgent action on a global scale, we call scientists and practitioners to mobilize their scientific networks and to intensify science\u2013policy interaction with national governments to support the negotiations on the establishment of an intergovernmental body based on scientific knowledge explaining the anticipated benefit for human and environmental health."

  "description": "Puckering the Planar Landscape of Fragments: Design and Synthesis of a 3D Cyclobutane Fragment LibraryFragment-based drug discovery (FBDD) has a growing need for unique screening libraries. The cyclobutane moiety was identified as an underrepresented yet attractive three-dimensional (3D) scaffold. Synthetic strategies were developed via a key 3-azido-cyclobutanone intermediate, giving potential access to a range of functional groups with accessible growth vectors. A focused set of 33 novel 3D cyclobutane fragments was synthesised, comprising three functionalities: secondary amines, amides, and sulfonamides. This library was designed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and an expanded version of the rule of three (RO3), followed by Principal Moment of Inertia (PMI) analysis to achieve both chemical diversity and high 3D character. Cis and trans ring isomers of library members were generated to maximise the shape diversity obtained, while limiting molecular complexity through avoiding enantiomers. Property analyses of the cyclobutane library indicated that it fares favourably against existing synthetic 3D fragment libraries in terms of shape and physicochemical properties."

  "description": "A bacterial extracellular vesicle-based intranasal vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 protects against disease and elicits neutralizing antibodies to wild-type and Delta variantsSeveral vaccines have been introduced to combat the coronavirus infectious disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines include mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles or adenoviral vectors that encode the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, inactivated virus, or protein subunits. Despite growing success in worldwide vaccination efforts, additional capabilities may be needed in the future to address issues such as stability and storage requirements, need for vaccine boosters, desirability of different routes of administration, and emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the Delta variant. Here, we present a novel, well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate based on extracellular vesicles (EVs) of Salmonella typhimurium that are decorated with the mammalian cell culture-derived Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD). RBD-conjugated outer membrane vesicles (RBD-OMVs) were used to immunize the golden Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) model of COVID-19. Intranasal immunization resulted in high titres of blood anti-RBD IgG as well as detectable mucosal responses. Neutralizing antibody activity against wild-type and Delta variants was evident in all vaccinated subjects. Upon challenge with live virus, hamsters immunized with RBD-OMV, but not animals immunized with unconjugated OMVs or a vehicle control, avoided body mass loss, had lower virus titres in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and experienced less severe lung pathology. Our results emphasize the value and versatility of OMV-based vaccine approaches."

  "description": "Exploring the statically screened G3W2 correction to the GW self-energy: Charged excitations and total energies of finite systemsElectron correlation in finite and extended systems is often described in an effective single-particle framework within the GW approximation. Here, we use the statically screened second-order exchange (SOX) contribution to the self-energy (G3W2) to calculate a perturbative correction to the GW self-energy. We use this correction to calculate total correlation energies of atoms, relative energies, as well as charged excitations of a wide range of molecular systems. We show that the second-order correction improves correlation energies with respect to the random-phase approximation and also improves relative energies for many, but not all, considered systems. The dynamically screened SOX term has previously been shown to consistently lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) quasiparticle (QP) energies and to increase the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) QP energies. We show here that the statically screened G3W2 correction consistently increases the LUMO QP energies, while no consistent trend can be observed for the HOMO levels. Also, confirming previous results, the magnitude of the correction is much smaller with the statically screened interaction than with the dynamically screened one. Quasiparticle self-consistent GW by itself is shown to be an excellent method for the calculation of charged excitation of finite systems, and it cannot consistently be improved upon by the G3W2 correction. For range-separated hybrid starting points, the description of fundamental gaps and HOMO QP energies is slightly worsened. However, tremendous improvements upon the GW LUMO energies, leading to almost perfect agreement with high-level coupled cluster reference methods, are observed. The evaluation of the statically screened G3W2 correction only comes with small additional computational cost compared to G0W0 for systems with up to 100 atoms and should therefore be suitable for practical applications.

  "description": "Global evaluation of the chemical hazard of recycled tire crumb rubber employed on worldwide synthetic turf football pitchesSocial and environmental concern about the use of crumb rubber from end-of-life car tires in the construction of different sport and recreational facilities is increasing due to the presence of hazardous compounds. The aim of this research was the assessment of 42 organic chemicals, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, adipates, antioxidants and vulcanisation agents in a large number of infill samples (91) from synthetic turf football pitches of diverse characteristics and geographical origin. Samples were taken worldwide, in 17 countries on 4 continents, to show the global dimension of this problem. Ultrasound assisted extraction was employed to extract the target compounds, followed by gas chromatography coupled to tandem-mass spectrometry (UAE-GC\u2013MS/MS). Seventy-eight crumb rubber samples as well as thirteen samples of alternatives materials, such as cork granulates, thermoplastic elastomers and coconut fibre, were analyzed. The results highlight the presence of all target PAH in most rubber samples at concentrations up to \u03bcg g\u22121, including the eight ECHA (European Chemicals Agency) PAHs considered as carcinogenic, and anthracene (ANC), pyrene (PYR) and benzo[ghi]perylene (B[ghi]P), catalogued as substances of very high concern (SVHC). Endocrine disruptors such as some plasticizers (mainly phthalates), and other compounds like benzothiazole (BTZ) and 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBTZ) were found reaching the mg g\u22121 level. This confirms the presence of the hazardous substances in the recycled crumb rubber samples collected all around the world. Three crumb rubber samples exceeded the limit of 20 \u03bcg g\u22121 for the sum of the eight ECHA PAHs. Regarding the chemical composition of other infill alternatives, cork appears to be adequate, while the thermoplastic elastomers contained high levels of some plasticizers. In addition, the plastic infill as well as the crumb rubber both are microplastics. Microplastics are considered contaminants of emerging concern since they do not biodegrade and remain in the environment for a long time."

  "description": "Phosphine addition to dehydroalanine for peptide modificationThiols are a functional group commonly used for selective reactions in a biochemical setting because of their high nucleophilicity. Phosphorus nucleophiles can undergo some similar reactions to thiols, but remain underexploited in this setting. In this work we show that phosphine nucleophiles react cleanly and quickly with a dehydroalanine electrophile, itself generated from cysteine, to give a stable adduct in a peptide context. NMR reveals the product to be a phosphonium ion and indicates some backbone conformational constraint, possibly arising from transient carbonyl coordination. The reaction proceeded quickly, with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 0.126 min\u22121 at 1 mM peptide (80% conversion in 10 min), and with no detectable side products on the peptide. A broad peptide sequence scope and water-soluble phosphines with alkyl as well as aromatic groups were all shown to react efficiently. Phosphine addition proved to be efficient on nisin as a model Dha-containing biologically-derived peptide and on an mRNA-displayed peptide, as well as on TCEP-modified agarose for peptide capture from solution. This reaction thus presents a promising approach for modification of peptides for cargo attachment or altered physical properties in peptide discovery."

  "description": "A Pathway-Based Genetic Score for Oxidative Stress: An Indicator of Host Vulnerability to Phthalate-Associated Adverse NeurodevelopmentThe developing brain is highly sensitive to environmental disturbances, and adverse exposures can act through oxidative stress. Given that oxidative stress susceptibility is determined partly by genetics, multiple studies have employed genetic scores to explore the role of oxidative stress in human disease. However, traditional approaches to genetic score construction face a range of challenges, including a lack of interpretability, bias towards the disease outcome, and often overfitting to the study they were derived on. Here, we develop an alternative strategy by first generating a genetic pathway function score for oxidative stress (gPFSox ) based on the transcriptional activity levels of the oxidative stress response pathway in brain and other tissue types. Then, in the Barwon Infant Study (BIS), a population-based birth cohort (n = 1074), we show that a high gPFSox, indicating reduced ability to counter oxidative stress, is linked to higher autism spectrum disorder risk and higher parent-reported autistic traits at age 4 years, with AOR values (per 2 additional pro-oxidant alleles) of 2.10 (95% CI (1.12, 4.11); p = 0.024) and 1.42 (95% CI (1.02, 2.01); p = 0.041), respectively. Past work in BIS has reported higher prenatal phthalate exposure at 36 weeks of gestation associated with offspring autism spectrum disorder. In this study, we examine combined effects and show a consistent pattern of increased neurodevelopmental problems for individuals with both a high gPFSox and high prenatal phthalate exposure across a range of outcomes, including high gPFSox and high DEHP levels against autism spectrum disorder (attributable proportion due to interaction 0.89; 95% CI (0.62, 1.16); p < 0.0001). The results highlight the utility of this novel functional genetic score and add to the growing evidence implicating gestational phthalate exposure in adverse neurodevelopment."

  "description": "Metabolic Conversions by Lactic Acid Bacteria during Plant Protein FermentationsTo secure a sustainable food supply for the rapidly growing global population, great efforts towards a plant-based diet are underway. However, the use of plant proteins comes with several challenges, such as improvement or removal of undesired flavours, and generation of desired texture properties. Fermentation holds large potential to alter these properties, but compared to dairy fermentations, our knowledge on strain properties in different plant-based substrates is still limited. Here, we explored different lactic acid bacteria for their ability to grow, produce flavour compounds, or remove off-flavour compounds from different plant proteins. For this, 151 LAB strains from dairy and non-dairy origins were cultured in plant protein plus coconut oil emulsions supplemented with glucose. Pea, chickpea, mung, fava, and soybean proteins were used in the study and bacterial strains for screening included the genera Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Leuconostoc. Efficient, high throughput, screening on plant proteins was developed and strains were assessed for their ability to (i) acidify and decrease the pH; (ii) express key enzymes involved in the formation of amino acid derived flavours, which included PepN (aminopeptidase N), PepXP (X-prolyl dipeptidyl peptidase), EstA (esterase), BcAT (branched chain aminotransferase), CBL (cystathione beta lyase), and ArAT (aromatic aminotransferase); and (iii) improve the overall aroma profile by generating dairy/cheesy notes and decreasing off flavours. Suitable screening conditions were determined, and highlighted the importance that a sufficient heat treatment must be applied to samples containing plant proteins, prior to fermentation, as an outgrowth of spore forming Bacillus cereus was observed if the material was only pasteurised. Enzyme activities for strains measured in rich broth vs. a buffered protein solution showed little-to-no correlation, which illustrated the importance of screening conditions to obtain predictive enzyme measurements. Aroma formation analysis allowed to identify strains that were able to increase key aromas such as diacetyl, acetoin, 2-and 3-methyl butanol, and 2,3pentanedione, as well as decrease the off-flavours hexanal, pentanal, and nonanal. Our findings illustrate the importance of strain specific differences in the assessed functionalities and how a methodical approach to screening LAB can be applied to select suitable microorganisms that show promise in fermentation of plant proteins when applied in non-dairy cheese applications."

This study\u2019s goal was to develop a robust and sensitive sampling and analytical method with double shot pyrolysis - gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and apply it to measure plastic particles \u2265700 nm in human whole blood from 22 healthy volunteers. Four high production volume polymers applied in plastic were identified and quantified for the first time in blood. Polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene and polymers of styrene (a sum parameter of polystyrene, expanded polystyrene, acetonitrile butadiene styrene etc.) were the most widely encountered, followed by poly(methyl methacrylate). Polypropylene was analysed but values were under the limits of quantification. In this study of a small set of donors, the mean of the sum quantifiable concentration of plastic particles in blood was 1.6 \u00b5g/ml, showing a first measurement of the mass concentration of the polymeric component of plastic in human blood. This pioneering human biomonitoring study demonstrated that plastic particles are bioavailable for uptake into the human bloodstream. An understanding of the exposure of these substances in humans and the associated hazard of such exposure is needed to determine whether or not plastic particle exposure is a public health risk."

  "description": "A quantitative AOP of mitochondrial toxicity based on data from three cell linesAdverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) are increasingly used to support the integration of in vitro data in hazard assessment for chemicals. Quantitative AOPs (qAOPs) use mathematical models to describe the relationship between key events (KEs). In this paper, data obtained in three cell lines, LHUMES, HepG2 and RPTEC/TERT1, using similar experimental protocols, was used to calibrate a qAOP of mitochondrial toxicity for two chemicals, rotenone and deguelin. The objectives were to determine whether the same qAOP could be used for the three cell types, and to test chemical-independence by cross-validation with a dataset obtained on eight other chemicals in LHUMES cells. Repeating the calibration approach for both chemicals in three cell lines highlighted various practical difficulties. Even when the same readouts of KEs are measured, the mathematical functions used to describe the key event relationships may not be the same. Cross-validation in LHUMES cells was attempted by estimating chemical-specific potency at the molecular initiating events and using the rest of the calibrated qAOP to predict downstream KEs: toxicity of azoxystrobin, carboxine, mepronil and thifluzamide was underestimated. Selection of most relevant readouts and accurate characterization of the molecular initiating event for cross-validation are critical when designing in vitro experiments targeted at calibrating qAOPs."

  "description": "In vitro and in vivo preclinical venom inhibition assays identify metalloproteinase inhibiting drugs as potential future treatments for snakebite envenoming by Dispholidus typusSnakebite envenoming affects more than 250,000 people annually in sub-Saharan Africa. Envenoming by Dispholidus typus (boomslang) results in venom-induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC), whereby highly abundant prothrombin-activating snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) consume clotting factors and deplete fibrinogen. The only available treatment for D. typus envenoming is the monovalent SAIMR Boomslang antivenom. Treatment options are urgently required because this antivenom is often difficult to source and, at US$6000/vial, typically unaffordable for most snakebite patients. We therefore investigated the in vitro and in vivo preclinical efficacy of four SVMP inhibitors to neutralise the effects of D. typus venom; the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors marimastat and prinomastat, and the metal chelators dimercaprol and DMPS. The venom of D. typus exhibited an SVMP-driven procoagulant phenotype in vitro. Marimastat and prinomastat demonstrated equipotent inhibition of the SVMP-mediated procoagulant activity of the venom in vitro, whereas dimercaprol and DMPS showed considerably lower potency. However, when tested in preclinical murine models of envenoming using mixed sex CD1 mice, DMPS and marimastat demonstrated partial protection against venom lethality, demonstrated by prolonged survival times of experimental animals, whereas dimercaprol and prinomastat failed to confer any protection at the doses tested. The preclinical results presented here demonstrate that DMPS and marimastat show potential as novel small molecule-based therapeutics for D. typus snakebite envenoming. These two drugs have been previously shown to be effective against Echis ocellatus VICC in preclinical models, and thus we conclude that marimastat and DMPS should be further explored as potentially valuable early intervention therapeutics to broadly treat VICC following snakebite envenoming in sub-Saharan Africa."

  "description": "How the Chalcogen Atom Size Dictates the Hydrogen-Bond Donor Capability of Carboxamides, Thioamides, and SelenoamidesThe amino groups of thio- and selenoamides can act as stronger hydrogen-bond donors than of carboxamides, despite the lower electronegativity of S and Se. This phenomenon has been experimentally explored, particularly in organocatalysis, but a sound electronic explanation is lacking. Our quantum chemical investigations show that the NH2 groups in thio- and selenoamides are more positively charged than in carboxamides. This originates from the larger electronic density flow from the nitrogen lone pair of the NH2 group towards the lower-lying \u03c0*C=S and \u03c0*C=Se orbitals than to the high-lying \u03c0*C=O orbital. The relative energies of the \u03c0* orbitals result from the overlap between the chalcogen np and carbon 2p atomic orbitals, which is set by the carbon-chalcogen equilibrium distance, a consequence of the Pauli repulsion between the two bonded atoms. Thus, neither the electronegativity nor the often-suggested polarizability but the steric size of the chalcogen atom determines the amide's hydrogen-bond donor capability."

  "description": "Effect of Different Exercise Training Modalities on Fasting Levels of Oxylipins and Endocannabinoids in Middle-Aged Sedentary Adults: A Randomized Controlled TrialThis study aimed to investigate the effects of different exercise training programs on fasting plasma levels of oxylipins, endocannabinoids (eCBs), and eCBs-like molecules in middle-aged sedentary adults. A 12-week randomized controlled trial was conducted using a parallel group design. Sixty-five middle-aged adults (40\u201365 years old) were randomly assigned to: (a) no exercise (control group), (b) concurrent training based on international physical activity recommendations (PAR group), (c) high-intensity interval training (HIIT group), and (d) HIIT together with whole-body electromyostimulation (HIIT + EMS group). Plasma levels of oxylipins, eCBs, and eCBs-like molecules were determined in plasma samples before and after the intervention using targeted lipidomics. Body composition was assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and dietary intake through a food frequency questionnaire and three nonconsecutive 24-hr recalls. The physical activity recommendations, HIIT, and HIIT-EMS groups showed decreased plasma levels of omega-6 and omega-3-derived oxylipins, and eCBs and eCBs-like molecules after 12 weeks (all \u0394 \u2264 \u22120.12; all p < .05). Importantly, after Bonferroni post hoc corrections, the differences in plasma levels of omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins were not statistically significant compared with the control group (all p > .05). However, after post hoc corrections, plasma levels of anandamide and oleoylethanolamide were increased in the physical activity recommendations group compared with the control group (anandamide: \u0394 = 0.05 vs. \u22120.09; oleoylethanolamide: \u0394 = \u22120.12 vs. 0.013, all p \u2264 .049). In conclusion, this study reports that a 12-week exercise training intervention, independent of the modality applied, does not modify fasting plasma levels of omega-6 and omega-3 oxylipins, eCBs, and eCBs-like molecules in middle-aged sedentary adults."

  "description": "Metabolic Modeling of Wine Fermentation at Genome ScaleWine fermentation is an ancient biotechnological process mediated by different microorganisms such as yeast and bacteria. Understanding of the metabolic and physiological phenomena taking place during this process can be now attained at a genome scale with the help of metabolic models. In this chapter, we present a detailed protocol for modeling wine fermentation using genome-scale metabolic models. In particular, we illustrate how metabolic fluxes can be computed, optimized and interpreted, for both yeast and bacteria under winemaking conditions. We also show how nutritional requirements can be determined and simulated using these models in relevant test cases. This chapter introduces fundamental concepts and practical steps for applying flux balance analysis in wine fermentation, and as such, it is intended for a broad microbiology audience as well as for practitioners in the metabolic modeling field."

  "description": "Hydrophilic interaction chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry for metabolomics and proteomics: state-of-the-art and current trendsAmong all the \u2013omics approaches, proteomics and metabolomics have received increased attention over the last decade. Both approaches have reached a certain level of maturity, showing their relevance in numerous clinical applications, including biomarkers discovery, improved diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of diseases, as well as a better knowledge on various (patho-)physiological processes. Analytically, reversed-phase liquid chromatography \u2013 mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS) is considered the golden standard in proteomics and metabolomics, due to its ease of use and reproducilibity. However, RPLC-MS alone is not sufficient to resolve the complexity of the proteome, while very polar metabolites are typically poorly retained. In this context, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) represents an attractive complementary approach, due to its orthogonal separation mechanism. This review presents an overview of the literature reporting the application of HILIC-MS in metabolomics and proteomics. For metabolomics the focus is on the analysis of bioactive lipids, amino acids, organic acids, and nucleotides/nucleosides, whereas for proteomics the analysis of complex samples and protein post-translational modifications therein using bottom-up, middle up/down proteomics and intact protein analysis is discussed. The review handles the technological aspects related to the use of HILIC-MS in both proteomics and metabolomics, paying attention to stationary phases, mobile phase conditions, injection volume and column temperature. Recent trends and developments in the application of HILIC-MS in proteomics and metabolomics are also presented and discussed, highlighting the advantages the technique can provide in addition or complementary to RPLC-MS, as well as the current limitations and possible solutions."

  "description": "New potential candidates for astronomical searches discovered in the electrical discharge of the PAH naphthalene and acetonitrileThe formation and dissociation mechanisms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as their reactivity with other interstellar molecules are elusive. In this work, we have investigated the electrical discharge chemistry of the PAH naphthalene and acetonitrile, a molecule known to be present in interstellar environments, using a combination of mass-selective IR-UV ion dip spectroscopy with the free electron laser FELIX in the mid-IR frequency region (550 \u2013 1800 cm\u22121) and quantum chemical calculations. In addition to the species known to be produced in the electrical discharge of pure naphthalene, \u2013CH3 and \u2013CN substituted unsaturated hydrocarbons have been identified. Most of them, in particular those containing a nitrogen atom in the molecular framework, such as 7H-benzo[7]annulenecarbonitrile, have a substantial dipole moment and, therefore, can be considered as potential candidates for radio astronomical searches. Among the species observed, the two isomers 1- and 2-cyanonaphthalene, which have been recently detected in the TMC-1, have been identified in our experiment, thus continuing to highlight the use of electrical discharge sources as a valuable tool to produce astronomically relevant species."

  "description": "Workflows for optimization of enzyme cascades and whole cell catalysis based on enzyme kinetic characterization and pathway modellingTo move towards a circular bioeconomy, sustainable strategies for the utilization of renewable, non-food biomass wastes such as lignocellulose, are needed. To this end, an efficient bioconversion of D-xylose \u2013 after D-glucose the most abundant sugar in lignocellulose \u2013 is highly desirable. Most standard organisms used in biotechnology are limited in metabolising D-xylose, and also in vitro enzymatic strategies for its conversion have not been very successful. We herein discuss that bioconversion of D-xylose is mostly hampered by missing knowledge on the kinetic properties of the enzymes involved in its metabolism. We propose a combination of classical enzyme characterizations and mathematical modelling approaches as a workflow for rational, model-based design to optimize enzyme cascades and/or whole cell biocatalysts for efficient D-xylose metabolism."

  "description": "Structural Properties of Phenylalanine-Based Dimers Revealed Using IR Action SpectroscopyPeptide segments with phenylalanine residues are commonly found in proteins that are related to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the self-assembly of phenylalanine-based peptides can be also functional. Peptides containing phenylalanine residues with different side caps, composition, and chemical alteration can form different types of nanostructures that find many applications in technology and medicine. Various studies have been performed in order to explain the remarkable stability of the resulting nanostructures. Here, we study the early stages of self-assembly of two phenylalanine derived peptides in the gas phase using IR action spectroscopy. Our focus lies on the identification of the key intra- and intermolecular interactions that govern the formation of the dimers. The far-IR region allowed us to distinguish between structural families and to assign the 2-(2-amino-2-phenylacetamido)-2-phenylacetic acid (PhgPhg) dimer to a very symmetric structure with two intermolecular hydrogen bonds and its aromatic rings folded away from the backbone. By comparison with the phenylalanine-based peptide cyclic L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanine (cyclo-FF), we found that the linear FF dimer likely adopts a less ordered structure. However, when one more phenylalanine residue is added (FFF), a more structurally organized dimer is formed with several intermolecular hydrogen bonds."

The effect of the stepwise introduction of substituents was pinpointed at the C\u2212X bond on the bond activation process. The C(n\u00b0)\u2212X bonds become substantially weaker going from C(0\u00b0)\u2212X, to C(1\u00b0)\u2212X, to C(2\u00b0)\u2212X, to C(3\u00b0)\u2212X because of the increasing steric repulsion between the C(n\u00b0)- and X-group. Interestingly, this often does not lead to a lower barrier for the C(n\u00b0)\u2212X bond activation. The C\u2212H activation barrier, for example, decreases from C(0\u00b0)\u2212X, to C(1\u00b0)\u2212X, to C(2\u00b0)\u2212X and then increases again for the very crowded C(3\u00b0)\u2212X bond. For the more congested C\u2212C bond, in contrast, the activation barrier always increases as the degree of substitution is increased. Our activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that these differences in C\u2212H and C\u2212C bond activation can be traced back to the opposing interplay between steric repulsion across the C\u2212X bond versus that between the catalyst and substrate."

  "description": "Experiences From Developing Software for Large X-Ray Crystallography-Driven Protein-Ligand StudiesThe throughput of macromolecular X-ray crystallography experiments has surged over the last decade. This remarkable gain in efficiency has been facilitated by increases in the availability of high-intensity X-ray beams, (ultra)fast detectors and high degrees of automation. These developments have in turn spurred the development of several dedicated centers for crystal-based fragment screening which enable the preparation and collection of hundreds of single-crystal diffraction datasets per day. Crystal structures of target proteins in complex with small-molecule ligands are of immense importance for structure-based drug design (SBDD) and their rapid turnover is a prerequisite for accelerated development cycles. While the experimental part of the process is well defined and has by now been established at several synchrotron sites, it is noticeable that software and algorithmic aspects have received far less attention, as well as the implications of new methodologies on established paradigms for structure determination, analysis, and visualization. We will review three key areas of development of large-scale protein-ligand studies. First, we will look into new software developments for batch data processing, followed by a discussion of the methodological changes in the analysis, modeling, refinement and deposition of structures for SBDD, and the changes in mindset that these new methods require, both on the side of depositors and users of macromolecular models. Finally, we will highlight key new developments for the presentation and analysis of the collections of structures that these experiments produce, and provide an outlook for future developments."

  "description": "How Ionization Catalyzes Diels-Alder ReactionsThe catalytic effect of ionization on the Diels-Alder reaction between 1,3-butadiene and acrylaldehyde has been studied using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Removal of an electron from the dienophile, acrylaldehyde, significantly accelerates the Diels-Alder reaction and shifts the reaction mechanism from concerted asynchronous for the neutral Diels-Alder reaction to stepwise for the radical-cation Diels-Alder reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal how ionization of the dienophile enhances the Diels-Alder reactivity via two mechanisms: (i) by amplifying the asymmetry in the dienophile's occupied \u03c0-orbitals to such an extent that the reaction goes from concerted asynchronous to stepwise and thus with substantially less steric (Pauli) repulsion per reaction step; (ii) by enhancing the stabilizing orbital interactions that result from the ability of the singly occupied molecular orbital of the radical-cation dienophile to engage in an additional three-electron bonding interaction with the highest occupied molecular orbital of the diene."

  "description": "Improving Results by Improving Densities: Density-Corrected Density Functional TheoryDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations have become widespread in both chemistry and materials, because they usually provide useful accuracy at much lower computational cost than wavefunction-based methods. All practical DFT calculations require an approximation to the unknown exchange-correlation energy, which is then used self-consistently in the Kohn-Sham scheme to produce an approximate energy from an approximate density. Density-corrected DFT is simply the study of the relative contributions to the total energy error. In the vast majority of DFT calculations, the error due to the approximate density is negligible. But with certain classes of functionals applied to certain classes of problems, the density error is sufficiently large as to contribute to the energy noticeably, and its removal leads to much better results. These problems include reaction barriers, torsional barriers involving I -conjugation, halogen bonds, radicals and anions, most stretched bonds, etc. In all such cases, use of a more accurate density significantly improves performance, and often the simple expedient of using the Hartree-Fock density is enough. This Perspective explains what DC-DFT is, where it is likely to improve results, and how DC-DFT can produce more accurate functionals. We also outline challenges and prospects for the field."

  "description": "Studying Metabolism by NMR-Based MetabolomicsDuring the past few decades, the direct analysis of metabolic intermediates in biological samples has greatly improved the understanding of metabolic processes. The most used technologies for these advances have been mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR is traditionally used to elucidate molecular structures and has now been extended to the analysis of complex mixtures, as biological samples: NMR-based metabolomics. There are however other areas of small molecule biochemistry for which NMR is equally powerful. These include the quantification of metabolites (qNMR); the use of stable isotope tracers to determine the metabolic fate of drugs or nutrients, unravelling of new metabolic pathways, and flux through pathways; and metabolite-protein interactions for understanding metabolic regulation and pharmacological effects. Computational tools and resources for automating analysis of spectra and extracting meaningful biochemical information has developed in tandem and contributes to a more detailed understanding of systems biochemistry. In this review, we highlight the contribution of NMR in small molecule biochemistry, specifically in metabolic studies by reviewing the state-of-the-art methodologies of NMR spectroscopy and future directions."

Given a set {S1,\u2026,Sk} of k strings of total length n, we are asked to find, for each string Si, i\u2208[1,k], its longest suffix that is a prefix of string Sj, for all j\u2260i, j\u2208[1,k]. Several algorithms running in the optimal O(n+k2) time for solving APSP are known. All of these algorithms are based on suffix sorting and thus require space \u03a9(n) in any case. We consider the parameterized version of the APSP problem, denoted by \u2113-APSP, in which we are asked to output only the pairs whose suffix/prefix overlap is of length at least \u2113. We give an algorithm for solving \u2113-APSP that runs in the optimal O(n+|OUTPUT\u2113|) time using O(n) space, where OUTPUT\u2113 is the set of output pairs. Our algorithm is thus optimal for the APSP problem as well by setting \u2113=0. Notably, our algorithm is fundamentally different from all optimal algorithms solving the APSP problem: it does not rely on sorting the suffixes of all input strings but on a novel traversal of the Aho-Corasick machine, and it thus requires space linear in the size of the machine."

  "description": "Using a Caenorhabditis elegans Parkinson\u2019s Disease Model to Assess Disease Progression and Therapy EfficiencyDespite Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) being the second most common neurodegenerative disease, treatment options are limited. Consequently, there is an urgent need to identify and screen new therapeutic compounds that slow or reverse the pathology of PD. Unfortunately, few new therapeutics are being produced, partly due to the low throughput and/or poor predictability of the currently used model organisms and in vivo screening methods. Our objective was to develop a simple and affordable platform for drug screening utilizing the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The effect of Levodopa, the \u201cGold standard\u201d of PD treatment, was explored in nematodes expressing the disease-causing \u03b1-synuclein protein. We focused on two key hallmarks of PD: plaque formation and mobility. Exposure to Levodopa ameliorated the mobility defect in C. elegans, similar to people living with PD who take the drug. Further, long-term Levodopa exposure was not detrimental to lifespan. This C. elegans-based method was used to screen a selection of small-molecule drugs for an impact on \u03b1-synuclein aggregation and mobility, identifying several promising compounds worthy of further investigation, most notably Ambroxol. The simple methodology means it can be adopted in many labs to pre-screen candidate compounds for a positive impact on disease progression."

During use of outdoor clothing, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) can be emitted from the DWR to the environment. In this study, the effects of aging, washing, and tumble drying on the concentration of extractable PFASs in the DWR of perfluorohexane-based short-chain SFPs (FC-6 chemistry) and of perfluorooctane-based long-chain SFPs (FC-8 chemistry) were assessed. For this purpose, polyamide (PA) and polyester (PES) fabrics were coated with FC-6- and FC-8-based DWRs. Results show that aging of the coated fabrics causes an increase in concentration and formation of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs). The effect of aging on the volatile PFASs depends on the type of fabric. Washing causes a decrease in PFAA concentrations, and in general, volatile PFASs are partly washed out of the textiles. However, washing can also increase the extractable concentration of volatile PFASs in the fabrics. This effect becomes stronger by a combination of aging and washing. Tumble drying does not affect the PFAS concentrations in textiles. In conclusion, aging and washing of fabrics coated with the DWR based on SFPs release PFASs to the environment."

  "description": "Probing Noncovalent Interactions in [3,3]MetaparacyclophanesArene-arene interactions are fundamentally important in molecular recognition. To precisely probe arene-arene interactions in cyclophanes, we designed and synthesized (2,6-phenol)paracyclophanes and (2,6-aniline)paracyclophanes that possess two aromatic rings in close proximity. Fine-tuning the aromatic character of one aromatic ring by fluorine substituents enables investigations on the intramolecular interactions between the electron-rich phenol and aniline with tetra-H- and tetra-F-substituted benzene. pKa measurements revealed that the tetra-F-template increases the acidity of the phenol (\u0394pKa = 0.55). X-ray crystallography and computational analyses demonstrated that all [3,3]metaparacyclophanes adopt cofacial parallel conformations, implying the presence of \u03c0-\u03c0stacking interactions. Advanced quantum chemical analyses furthermore revealed that both electrostatic interactions and orbital interactions provide the key contribution to the structure and stability of [3,3]metaparacyclophanes.

  "description": "Probing the redox-conversion of Co(II)-disulfide to Co(III)-thiolate complexes: the effect of ligand-field strengthThe redox-conversion reaction of cobalt(II)-disulfide to cobalt(III)-thiolate complexes triggered by addition of the bidentate ligand 2,2'-bipyridine has been investigated. Reaction of the cobalt(II)-disulfide complex [Co2(L1SSL1)(X)4] (L1SSL1 = di-2-(bis(2-pyridylmethyl)amino)-ethyldisulfide; X = Cl or Br) [1X] with 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) resulted in the formation of two different products, namely the cobalt(III)-thiolate complex [Co(L1S)(bpy)]X2 and the unexpected side product [Co2(L1SSL1)(bpy)2(X)2]X2. Crystals of [Co2(L1SSL1)(bpy)2(Cl)2](BPh4)2 [2Cl](BPh4)2 obtained after anion exchange showed the cobalt(II) ions to be in octahedral geometries with the nitrogen donors of the disulfide ligand arranged in a facial conformation and the chloride ion trans to the tertiary amine nitrogen. Remarkably, this side product cannot be converted to the cobalt(III)-thiolate compound [Co(L1S)(bpy)](SbF6)2 [3](SbF6)2 by removal of the chloride ion with use of a silver salt, as this causes scrambling of the ligands, resulting in the formation of [Co(bpy)3]n+. [Co(L1S)(bpy)](SbF6)2 was obtained in a pure form by addition of bpy to a solution in acetonitrile of the compound [Co(L1S)(MeCN)2]2+ [4]2+. Addition of NEt4Cl to [3](SbF6)2 regenerates the cobalt(II)-disulfide complex [1Cl] as confirmed spectroscopically. DFT studies revealed that the conversion from [1Cl] to [3]2+ most likely occurs via the hypothetical intermediate species [2Cl]2+mer, in which the nitrogen atoms of the disulfide ligand are arranged in a meridional conformation. Interestingly, the estimated d-orbital splitting energy of [3]2+ is lower than that of [4]2+, indicating that the ligand-field strength of bpy is lower than anticipated, which hampers clean conversion in the redox-conversion reaction. This study shows that the redox-conversion reaction between cobalt(II)-disulfide and cobalt(III)-thiolate complexes is intricate rather than straightforward."

  "description": "Enhanced underground metabolism challenges life at high temperature\u2013metabolic thermoadaptation in hyperthermophilic ArchaeaThe text-book picture of a perfect, well organised metabolism with highly specific enzymes, is challenged by non-enzymatic reactions and promiscuous enzymes. This, so-called \u2018underground metabolism\u2019, is a special challenge for hyperthermophilic Archaea that thrive at temperatures above 80 \u00b0C and possess modified central metabolic pathways often with promiscuous enzymes. Hence, the question arises how extremely thermophilic Archaea can operate their unusual metabolism at temperatures where many pathway intermediates are unstable? We herein discuss current insights in the underground metabolism and metabolic thermoadaptation of (hyper)thermophilic Archaea. So far, only a few repair enzymes and salvaging pathways have been investigated in Archaea. Studies of the central carbohydrate metabolism indicate that a number of different strategies have evolved: 1) reduction of the concentration of unstable metabolites, 2) different pathway topologies are used with newly induced enzymes, and 3) damaged metabolites are removed via new metabolic pathways."

  "description": "The development of a generic analysis method for natural and synthetic dyes by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography with photo-diode-array detection and triethylamine as an ion-pairing agentIn cultural heritage the characterization of organic colorants is a challenging task. Currently, different chromatographic techniques are used to analyze natural and synthetic dyes separately, since the classes differ significantly in chemical properties and, therefore, chromatographic behavior. To save time, costs and sample material, we developed a method suitable for a wide variety of organic colorants using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photo-diode-array detector. Gradient elution was performed with a mobile phase consisting of water and methanol with 5 mM triethylamine added as an ion-pairing agent at a pH of 3. Both linear and step gradients were optimized using the \u2018Program for Interpretive Optimization of Two-dimensional Resolution\u2019 (PIOTR) Pirok et al. [22]. Two optimized linear gradients and two step gradients were evaluated experimentally. The method was applied on a complex dye mixture containing nearly 130 natural- and synthetic-dye reference compounds. More than 100 of these compounds could be identified in a single experiment. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated by analyzing samples of several precious objects that were found in the Texel shipwreck Vos et al. [2] and of two embroideries of Emile Bernard, the results of which are described in this paper."

  "description": "Modern venomics-Current insights, novel methods, and future perspectives in biological and applied animal venom researchVenoms have evolved >100 times in all major animal groups, and their components, known as toxins, have been fine-tuned over millions of years into highly effective biochemical weapons. There are many outstanding questions on the evolution of toxin arsenals, such as how venom genes originate, how venom contributes to the fitness of venomous species, and which modifications at the genomic, transcriptomic, and protein level drive their evolution. These questions have received particularly little attention outside of snakes, cone snails, spiders, and scorpions. Venom compounds have further become a source of inspiration for translational research using their diverse bioactivities for various applications. We highlight here recent advances and new strategies in modern venomics and discuss how recent technological innovations and multi-omic methods dramatically improve research on venomous animals. The study of genomes and their modifications through CRISPR and knockdown technologies will increase our understanding of how toxins evolve and which functions they have in the different ontogenetic stages during the development of venomous animals. Mass spectrometry imaging combined with spatial transcriptomics, in situ hybridization techniques, and modern computer tomography gives us further insights into the spatial distribution of toxins in the venom system and the function of the venom apparatus. All these evolutionary and biological insights contribute to more efficiently identify venom compounds, which can then be synthesized or produced in adapted expression systems to test their bioactivity. Finally, we critically discuss recent agrochemical, pharmaceutical, therapeutic, and diagnostic (so-called translational) aspects of venoms from which humans benefit."

  "description": "Clustering Demographics and Sequences of Diagnosis CodesA Relational-Sequential dataset (or RS-dataset for short) contains records comprised of a patient's values in demographic attributes and their sequence of diagnosis codes. The task of clustering an RS-dataset is helpful for analyses ranging from pattern mining to classification. However, existing methods are not appropriate to perform this task. Thus, we initiate a study of how an RS-dataset can be clustered effectively and efficiently. We formalize the task of clustering an RS-dataset as an optimization problem. At the heart of the problem is a distance measure we design to quantify the pairwise similarity between records of an RS-dataset. Our measure uses a tree structure that encodes hierarchical relationships between records, based on their demographics, as well as an edit-distance-like measure that captures both the sequentiality and the semantic similarity of diagnosis codes. We also develop an algorithm which first identifies k representative records (centers), for a given k, and then constructs k clusters, each containing one center and the records that are closer to the center compared to other centers. Experiments using two Electronic Health Record datasets demonstrate that our algorithm constructs compact and well-separated clusters, which preserve meaningful relationships between demographics and sequences of diagnosis codes, while being efficient and scalable.

The ultrashort laser pulses allow to resolve the molecular processes occurring on the femtosecond timescales. Fluorene is a prototypical small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Through their infrared emission signature, PAHs have been shown to be ubiquitous in the universe, and they are assumed to play an important role in the chemistry of the interstellar medium. Our experiments track the ionization and dissociative ionization products of fluorene through time-of-flight mass spectrometry and velocity-map imaging. Multiple processes involved in the formation of each of the fragment ions are disentangled through analysis of the ion images. The relaxation lifetimes of the excited fluorene monocation and dication obtained through the fragment formation channels are reported to be in the range of a few tens of femtoseconds to a few picoseconds."

In this study, we investigated to what extent absorbed oil was biodegraded and how this compared to the biodegradation of oil in water. To do so, we incubated two bacterial communities originating from the Niger Delta, an area subject to frequent oil spills, in the presence and absence of polypropylene particles. One community evolved from untreated soil whereas the second evolved from soil pre-exposed to oil. We observed that the polypropylene particles stimulated the growth of biofilms and enriched species from genera Mycobacterium, Sphingomonas and Parvibaculum. Cultures with polypropylene particles degraded more crude oil than those where the oil was present in suspension regardless of whether they were pre-exposed or not. Moreover, the community pre-exposed to crude oil had a different community structure and degraded more oil than the one from untreated soil. We conclude that the biodegradation rate of crude oil was enhanced by the pre-exposure of the bacterial communities to crude oil and by the use of oil-absorbing polypropylene materials. The data show that bacterial communities in the biofilms growing on the particles have an enhanced degradation capacity for oil."

  "description": "Acute, Sublethal, and Developmental Toxicity of Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) Leaf Preparations on Caenorhabditis elegans as an Invertebrate Model for Human ExposureKratom (Mitragyna speciosa Korth.) is a tree native to Southeast Asia with stimulant and opioid-like effects which has seen increased use in Europe and North America in recent years. Its safety and pharmacological effects remain under investigation, especially in regard to developmental and generational toxicity. In the current study, we investigated commercial kratom preparations using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a translational model for toxicity and pharmacological effects. The pure alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine as well as aqueous, ethanolic, and methanolic extracts of three commercial kratom products were evaluated using a battery of developmental, genotoxic, and opioid-related experiments. As determined pre-viously, the mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine content in kratom samples was higher in the alcoholic extracts than the aqueous extracts. Above the human consumption range equivalent of 15\u201370 \u00b5g/mL, kratom dose-dependently reduced brood size and health of parent worms and their progeny. 7-hydroxymitragynine, but not mitragynine, presented with toxic and developmental effects at very high concentrations, while the positive control, morphine, displayed toxic effects at 0.5 mM. Kratom and its alkaloids did not affect pumping rate or interpump interval in the same way as morphine, suggesting that kratom is unlikely to act primarily via the opioid-signalling path-way. Only at very high doses did kratom cause developmental and genotoxic effects in nematodes, indicating its relative safety."

  "description": "Genetic Elements Orchestrating Lactobacillus crispatus Glycogen Metabolism in the VaginaGlycogen in the female lower reproductive tract is a major carbon source for colonization and acidification by common vaginal Lactobacillus species, such as Lactobacillus crispatus. Previously, we identified the amylopullulanase encoding gene pulA of Lactobacillus crispatus to correlate with the ability to autonomously utilize glycogen for growth. Here, we further characterize genetic variation and differential regulation of pulA affecting the presence of its gene product on the outer surface layer. We show that alpha-glucan degrading activity dissipates when Lactobacillus crispatus is grown on glucose, maltose and maltotriose, in agreement with carbon catabolite repression elements flanking the pulA gene. Proteome analysis of the S-layer confirmed that the amylopullulanase protein is highly abundant in an S-layer enriched fraction, but not in a strain with a defective amylopullulanase variant or in an amylopullulanase-sufficient strain grown on glucose. In addition, we provide evidence that Lactobacillus crispatus pulA mutants are relevant in vivo, as they are commonly observed in metagenome datasets of human vaginal microbial communities. Analysis of the largest publicly available dataset of 1507 human vaginal metagenomes indicates that among the 270 samples that contain a Lactobacillus crispatus pulA gene, 62 samples (23%) had a defective variant of this gene. Taken together, these results demonstrate that both environmental, as well as genetic factors explain the variation of Lactobacillus crispatus alpha-glucosidases in the vaginal environment."

  "description": "Plasma Levels of Endocannabinoids and Their Analogues Are Related to Specific Fecal Bacterial Genera in Young Adults: Role in Gut Barrier IntegrityObjective: To investigate the association of plasma levels of endocannabinoids with fecal microbiota. Methods: Plasma levels of endocannabinoids, anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), as well as their eleven analogues, and arachidonic acid (AA), were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 92 young adults. DNA extracted from stool samples was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Lipopolysaccharide levels were measured in plasma samples. Results: Plasma levels of endocannabinoids and their analogues were not related to beta or alpha diversity indexes. Plasma levels of AEA and related N-acylethanolamines correlated positively with the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium genus (all rho \u2265 0.26, p \u2264 0.012) and Akkermansia genus (all rho \u2265 0.22, p \u2264 0.036), and negatively with the relative abundance of Bilophila genus (all rho \u2264 \u22120.23, p \u2264 0.031). Moreover, plasma levels of 2-AG and other acylglycerols correlated positively with the relative abundance of Parasutterella (all rho \u2265 0.24, p \u2264 0.020) and Odoribacter genera (all rho \u2265 0.27, p \u2264 0.011), and negatively with the relative abundance of Prevotella genus (all rho \u2264 \u22120.24, p \u2264 0.023). In participants with high lipopolysaccharide values, the plasma levels of AEA and related N-acylethanolamines, as well as AA and 2-AG, were negatively correlated with plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide (all rho \u2264 \u22120.24, p \u2264 0.020). Conclusion: Plasma levels of endocannabinoids and their analogues are correlated to specific fecal bacterial genera involved in maintaining gut barrier integrity in young adults. This suggests that plasma levels of endocannabinoids and their analogues may play a role in the gut barrier integrity in young adults."

The oxidative addition barrier decreases along this series, even though the strength of the bonds increases going from C(sp3)\u2212X, to C(sp2)\u2212X, to C(sp)\u2212X. Activation strain and matching energy decomposition analyses reveal that the decreased oxidative addition barrier going from sp3, to sp2, to sp, originates from a reduction in the destabilizing steric (Pauli) repulsion between catalyst and substrate. This is the direct consequence of the decreasing coordination number of the carbon atom in C(spn)\u2212X, which goes from four, to three, to two along this series. The associated net stabilization of the catalyst\u2013substrate interaction dominates the trend in strain energy which indeed becomes more destabilizing along this same series as the bond becomes stronger from C(sp3)\u2212X to C(sp)\u2212X."

  "description": "Natural range separation of the Coulomb holeA natural range separation of the Coulomb hole into two components, one of them being predominant at long interelectronic separations (hcI ) and the other at short distances (hcII ), is exhaustively analyzed throughout various examples that put forward the most relevant features of this approach and how they can be used to develop efficient ways to capture electron correlation. We show that hcI , which only depends on the first-order reduced density matrix, can be used to identify molecules with a predominant nondynamic correlation regime and differentiate between two types of nondynamic correlation, types A and B. Through the asymptotic properties of the hole components, we explain how hcI can retrieve the long-range part of electron correlation. We perform an exhaustive analysis of the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis set, dissecting the hole contributions into spin components. We also analyze the simplest molecule presenting a dispersion interaction and how hcII helps identify it. The study of several atoms in different spin states reveals that the Coulomb hole components distinguish correlation regimes that are not apparent from the entire hole. The results of this work hold out the promise to aid in developing new electronic structure methods that efficiently capture electron correlation."

  "description": "Convergent evolution of toxin resistance in animalsConvergence is the phenomenon whereby similar phenotypes evolve independently in different lineages. One example is resistance to toxins in animals. Toxins have evolved many times throughout the tree of life. They disrupt molecular and physiological pathways in target species, thereby incapacitating prey or deterring a predator. In response, molecular resistance has evolved in many species exposed to toxins to counteract their harmful effects. Here, we review current knowledge on the convergence of toxin resistance using examples from a wide range of toxin families. We explore the evolutionary processes and molecular adaptations driving toxin resistance. However, resistance adaptations may carry a fitness cost if they disrupt the normal physiology of the resistant animal. Therefore, there is a trade-off between maintaining a functional molecular target and reducing toxin susceptibility. There are relatively few solutions that satisfy this trade-off. As a result, we see a small set of molecular adaptations appearing repeatedly in diverse animal lineages, a phenomenon that is consistent with models of deterministic evolution. Convergence may also explain what has been called \u2018autoresistance\u2019. This is often thought to have evolved for self-protection, but we argue instead that it may be a consequence of poisonous animals feeding on toxic prey. Toxin resistance provides a unique and compelling model system for studying the interplay between trophic interactions, selection pressures and the molecular mechanisms underlying evolutionary novelties."

Published research that used multiple computer languages for their analysis pipelines would include a complete and reusable description of that analysis that is runnable on a diverse set of computing environments. Researchers would be able to easier collaborate and reuse these pipelines, adding or exchanging components regardless of programming language used; collaborations with and within the industry would be easier; approval of new medical interventions that rely on such pipelines would be faster. Time will be saved and environmental impact would also be reduced, as these descriptions contain enough information for advanced optimization without user intervention. Workflows are widely used in data analysis pipelines, enabling innovation and decision-making for the modern society. In many domains the analysis components are numerous and written in multiple different computer languages by third parties. However, lacking a standard for reusable and portable multilingual workflows, then reusing published multilingual workflows, collaborating on open problems, and optimizing their execution would be severely hampered. Moreover, only a standard for multilingual data analysis pipelines that was widely used would enable considerable benefits to research-industry collaboration, regulatory cost control, and to preserving the environment. Prior to the start of the CWL project, there was no standard for describing multilingual analysis pipelines in a portable and reusable manner. Even today / currently, although there exist hundreds of single-vendor and other single-source systems that run workflows, none is a general, community-driven, and consensus-built standard. "

  "description": "Escape from planarity in fragment-based drug discovery: A synthetic strategy analysis of synthetic 3D fragment librariesIn fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD), there is a developing appreciation that 3D fragments could offer opportunities that are not provided by 2D fragments. This review provides an overview of the synthetic strategies that have been used to prepare 3D fragments, as discussed in 25 papers published from 2011 to mid-May 2020. Three distinct strategies are highlighted: (i) diversity-oriented synthesis; (ii) the synthesis and diversification of scaffolds; and (iii) computational design and synthesis (where 3D fragments were computationally enumerated and filtered on the basis of computationally generated 3D shape descriptors and other properties). We conclude that a workflow that combines computational design and one other strategy, together with a consideration of fragment properties, 3D shape and \u2018fragment sociability\u2019, could allow 3D fragments to feature more widely in fragment libraries and could facilitate fragment-to-lead optimisation."

  "description": "Direct transcriptomic comparison of xenobiotic metabolism and toxicity pathway induction of airway epithelium models at an air\u2013liquid interface generated from induced pluripotent stem cells and primary bronchial epithelial cellsAbstract: The airway epithelium represents the main barrier between inhaled air and the tissues of the respiratory tract and is therefore an important point of contact with xenobiotic substances into the human body. Several studies have recently shown that in vitro models of the airway grown at an air\u2013liquid interface (ALI) can be particularly useful to obtain mechanistic information about the toxicity of chemical compounds. However, such methods are not very amenable to high throughput since the primary cells cannot be expanded indefinitely in culture to obtain a sustainable number of cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become a popular option in the recent years for modelling the airways of the lung, but despite progress in the field, such models have so far not been assessed for their ability to metabolise xenobiotic compounds and how they compare to the primary bronchial airway model (pBAE). Here, we report a comparative analysis by TempoSeq (oligo-directed sequencing) of an iPSC-derived airway model (iBAE) with a primary bronchial airway model (pBAE). The iBAE and pBAE were differentiated at an ALI and then evaluated in a 5-compound screen with exposure to a sub-lethal concentration of each compound for 24h. We found that despite lower expression of xenobiotic metabolism genes, the iBAE similarly predicted the toxic pathways when compared to the pBAE model. Our results show that iPSC airway models at ALI show promise for inhalation toxicity assessments with further development. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]."

  "description": "Liquid Core Waveguide Cell with in Situ Absorbance Spectroscopy and Coupled to Liquid Chromatography for Studying Light-Induced DegradationIn many areas, studying photostability or the mechanism of photodegradation is of high importance. Conventional methods to do so can be rather time-consuming, laborious, and prone to experimental errors. In this paper we evaluate an integrated and fully automated system for the study of light-induced degradation, comprising a liquid handler, an irradiation source and exposure cell with dedicated optics and spectrograph, and a liquid chromatography (LC) system. A liquid core waveguide (LCW) was used as an exposure cell, allowing efficient illumination of the sample over a 12 cm path length. This cell was coupled to a spectrograph, allowing in situ absorbance monitoring of the exposed sample during irradiation. The LCW is gas-permeable, permitting diffusion of air into the cell during light exposure. This unit was coupled online to LC with diode array detection for immediate and automated analysis of the composition of the light-exposed samples. The analytical performance of the new system was established by assessing linearity, limit of detection, and repeatability of the in-cell detection, sample recovery and carryover, and overall repeatability of light-induced degradation monitoring, using riboflavin as the test compound. The applicability of the system was demonstrated by recording a photodegradation time profile of riboflavin. "

We studied a white-rot fungus Rigidoporus sp. FMD21, which has a high laccase activity, for its efficiency to degrade these herbicides. A positive correlation was found between its laccase activity and the corresponding herbicide degradation rate. Even more, the doubling of the enzyme activity in this phase corresponded with a doubling of the herbicide degradation rate. It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that laccase is the most dominant enzyme in the degradation of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T under these conditions. In addition, it was shown that Rigidoporus sp. FMD21 partly relies on cytochromes P450-type for the breakdown of the herbicides as well. Two filamentous fungi were isolated from soil contaminated with herbicides and dioxins located at Bien Hoa airbase. They belong to genera Fusarium and Verticillium of the phylum Ascomycota as judged by their 18S rRNA gene sequences. Both isolated fungi were able to degrade the herbicides but with different rates. Their laccase activity, however, was very low and did not correlate with the rate of breakdown of the herbicides. These data indicate that the white-rot fungus most likely synthesizes laccase and cytochromes P450-type for the breakdown of the herbicides, while the types of enzyme used for the breakdown of the herbicides by the two Ascomycota remain unclear.

By designing an appropriate reduction, we show that a combinatorial algorithm solving the EDSM problem in \\scrO (nm1.5 - \\epsilon + N) time, for any \\epsilon > 0, refutes this conjecture. Our reduction should be understood as an indication that decreasing the exponent requires fast matrix multiplication. String periodicity and fast Fourier transform are two standard tools in string algorithms. Our main technical contribution is that we successfully combine these tools with fast matrix multiplication to design a noncombinatorial \\scrO \\~(nm\\omega -1 + N)-time algorithm for EDSM, where \\omega denotes the matrix multiplication exponent and the \\scrO \\~(\\cdot ) notation suppresses polylog factors. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine these tools. In particular, using the fact that \\omega < 2.373 [Alman and Williams, SODA 2021; Le Gall, ISSAC 2014; Williams, STOC 2012], we obtain an \\scrO (nm1.373 + N)-time algorithm for EDSM. An important building block in our solution that might find applications in other problems is a method of selecting a small set of length-\\ell substrings of the pattern, called anchors, so that any occurrence of a string from an ED text set contains at least one but not too many (on average) such anchors inside."

  "description": "Manganese Modulates Metabolic Activity and Redox Homeostasis in Translationally Blocked Lactococcus cremoris, Impacting Metabolic Persistence, Cell Culturability, and Flavor FormationManganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is supplemented in microbial media with varying benefits across species and growth conditions. We found that growth of Lactococcus cremoris was unaffected by manganese omission from the growth medium. The main proteome adaptation to manganese omission involved increased manganese transporter production (up to 2,000-fold), while the remaining 10 significant proteome changes were between 1.4- and 4-fold. Further investigation in translationally blocked (TB), nongrowing cells showed that Mn supplementation (20 mM) led to approximately 1.5 X faster acidification compared with Mn-free conditions. However, this faster acidification stagnated within 24 h, likely due to draining of intracellular NADH that coincides with substantial loss of culturability. Conversely, without manganese, nongrowing cells persisted to acidify for weeks, albeit at a reduced rate, but maintaining redox balance and culturability. Strikingly, despite being unculturable, a-keto acid-derived aldehydes continued to accumulate in cells incubated in the presence of manganese, whereas without manganese cells predominantly formed the corresponding alcohols. This is most likely reflecting NADH availability for the alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed conversion. Overall, manganese influences the lactococcal acidification rate, and flavor formation capacity in a redox dependent manner. These are important industrial traits especially during cheese ripening, where cells are in a non-growing, often unculturable state. IMPORTANCE In nature as well as in various biotechnology applications, microorganisms are often in a nongrowing state and their metabolic persistence determines cell survival and functionality. Industrial examples are dairy fermentations where bacteria remain active during the ripening phases that can take up to months and even years. Here we investigated environmental factors that can influence lactococcal metabolic persistence throughout such prolonged periods. We found that in the absence of manganese, acidification of nongrowing cells remained active for weeks while in the presence of manganese it stopped within 1 day. The latter coincided with the accumulation of amino acid derived volatile metabolites. Based on metabolic conversions, proteome analysis, and a reporter assay, we demonstrated that the manganese elicited effects were NADH dependent. Overall the results show the effect of environmental modulation on prolonged cell-based catalysis, which is highly relevant to nongrowing cells in nature and biotechnological applications."

  "description": "Quantification of endocannabinoids in human cerebrospinal fluid using a novel micro-flow liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methodThe endocannabinoid system (ECS) is implicated in various brain disorders. Changes in the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be associated with ECS-related pathologies. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) and their analogues are present at low concentrations in human CSF, which hampered the investigation of the ECS in this body fluid. In this study, we developed a highly sensitive and selective micro-flow liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (micro-LC-MS/MS) method for the analysis of eCBs and eCB analogues in human CSF. The developed method allowed for the quantitative analysis of 16 eCBs and their analogues in human CSF. Micro-LC-MS/MS analyses were performed at a flow-rate of 4 \u03bcL min\u22121 with a 0.3-mm inner diameter column. A minor modification of a novel spray needle was carried out to improve the robustness of our method. By using an injection volume of 3 \u03bcL, our method reached limits of detection in the range from 0.6 to 1293.4 pM and limits of quantification in range from 2.0 to 4311.3 pM while intra- and interday precisions were below 13.7%. The developed workflow was successfully used for the determination of eCBs in 288 human CSF samples. It is anticipated that the proposed approach will contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of ECS in various brain disorders."

  "description": "Chemical potential, derivative discontinuity, fractional electrons, jump of the Kohn-Sham potential, atoms as thermodynamic open systems, and other (mis)conceptions of the density functional theory of electrons in moleculesMany references exist in the density functional theory (DFT) literature to the chemical potential of the electrons in an atom or a molecule. The origin of this notion has been the identification of the Lagrange multiplier \u03bc = \u2202E/\u2202N in the Euler-Lagrange variational equation for the ground state density as the chemical potential of the electrons. We first discuss why the Lagrange multiplier in this case is an arbitrary constant and therefore cannot be a physical characteristic of an atom or molecule. The switching of the energy derivative (\u201cchemical potential\u201d) from \u2212I to \u2212A when the electron number crosses the integer, called integer discontinuity or derivative discontinuity, is not physical but only occurs when the nonphysical noninteger electron systems and the corresponding energy and derivative \u2202E/\u2202N are chosen in a specific discontinuous way. The question is discussed whether in fact the thermodynamical concept of a chemical potential can be defined for the electrons in such few-electron systems as atoms and molecules. The conclusion is that such systems lack important characteristics of thermodynamic systems and do not afford the definition of a chemical potential. They also cannot be considered as analogues of the open systems of thermodynamics that can exchange particles with an environment (a particle bath or other members of a Gibbsian ensemble). Thermodynamical (statistical mechanical) concepts like chemical potential, open systems, grand canonical ensemble etc. are not applicable to a few electron system like an atom or molecule. A number of topics in DFT are critically reviewed in light of these findings: jumps in the Kohn-Sham potential when crossing an integer number of electrons, the band gap problem, the deviation-from-straight-lines error, and the role of ensembles in DFT."

  "description": "The cost of photovoltaics: Re-evaluating grid parity for PV systems in ChinaThe price of photovoltaics (PV) has been steadily decreasing over the last decade, and many reports suggest that PV has become considerably cheaper than conventional electricity sources. In this paper, we critically evaluate the PV grid parity and use China as a case study. China is an interesting case study due to the wealth of data combined with the recent decrease in financial subsidies. Electricity costs are commonly compared in the literature using levelized costs of electricity (LCOE). However traditional LCOE analyses neglect important cost factors that are specific to PV, in particular the cost of grid integration. Here, we demonstrate that system LCOE calculation more accurately estimates the grid parity of PV. We find that the integration costs account for 15% of the total system costs, which cannot be neglected with the higher penetration of PV in the electricity system. Further, provincial grid parity indexes are greater than 1, indicating that the grid parity from a system LCOE perspective has not yet been achieved. The learning rate of Chinese PV is still relatively small, and we estimate that grid parity for PV in China will be achieved between 2020 and 2032, depending on the region. These findings shed new light on assessing grid parity of PV systems by considering relevant local parameters and thereby offer an assessment method framework and prediction modeling for assessing grid parity of PV installations."

  "description": "BioSimulators: a central registry of simulation engines and services for recommending specific toolsComputational models have great potential to accelerate bioscience, bioengineering, and medicine. However, it remains challenging to reproduce and reuse simulations, in part, because the numerous formats and methods for simulating various subsystems and scales remain siloed by different software tools. For example, each tool must be executed through a distinct interface. To help investigators find and use simulation tools, we developed BioSimulators (https://biosimulators.org), a central registry of the capabilities of simulation tools and consistent Python, command-line and containerized interfaces to each version of each tool. The foundation of BioSimulators is standards, such as CellML, SBML, SED-ML and the COMBINE archive format, and validation tools for simulation projects and simulation tools that ensure these standards are used consistently. To help modelers find tools for particular projects, we have also used the registry to develop recommendation services. We anticipate that BioSimulators will help modelers exchange, reproduce, and combine simulations."

  "description": "3-nitroimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine as a novel scaffold for antiparasitics with sub-nanomolar anti-Giardia lamblia activityAs there is a continuous need for novel anti-infectives, the present study aimed to fuse two modes of action into a novel 3-nitroimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine scaffold to improve antiparasitic efficacy. For this purpose, we combined known structural elements of phosphodiesterase inhibitors, a target recently proposed for Trypanosoma brucei and Giardia lamblia, with a nitroimidazole scaffold to generate nitrosative stress. The compounds were evaluated in vitro against a panel of protozoal parasites, namely Giardia lamblia, Trypanosoma brucei, T. cruzi, Leishmania infantum and Plasmodium falciparum and for cytotoxicity on MRC-5 cells. Interestingly, selective sub-nanomolar activity was obtained against G. lamblia, and by testing several analogues with and without the nitro group, it was shown that the presence of a nitro group, but not PDE inhibition, is responsible for the low IC50 values of these novel compounds. Adding the favourable drug-like properties (low molecular weight, cLogP (1.2\u20134.1) and low polar surface area), the key compounds from the 3-nitroimidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine series can be considered as valuable hits for further anti-giardiasis drug exploration and development."

  "description": "Delineation of the GPR15 receptor-mediated G\u03b1 protein signalling profile in recombinant mammalian cellsThe GPR15 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which is activated by an endogenous peptide GPR15L(25\u201381) and a C-terminal peptide fragment GPR15L(71\u201381). GPR15 signals through the Gi/o pathway to decrease intracellular cyclic adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (cAMP). However, the activation profiles of the GPR15 receptor within Gi/o subtypes have not been examined. Moreover, whether the receptor can also couple to Gs, Gq/11 and G12/13 is unclear. Here, GPR15L(25\u201381) and GPR15L(71\u201381) are used as pharmacological tool compounds to delineate the GPR15 receptor-mediated G\u03b1 protein signalling using a G protein activation assay and second messenger assay conducted on living cells. The results show that the GPR15 receptor preferentially couples to Gi/o rather than other pathways in both assays. Within the Gi/o family, the GPR15 receptor activates all the subtypes (Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, GoA, GoB and Gz). The Emax and activation rates of Gi1, Gi2, Gi3, GoA and GoB are similar, whilst the Emax of Gz is smaller and the activation rate is significantly slower. The potencies of both peptides toward each Gi/o subtype have been determined. Furthermore, the GPR15 receptor signals through Gi/o to inhibit cAMP accumulation, which could be blocked by the application of the Gi/o inhibitor pertussis toxin."

  "description": "Fate-directed risk assessment of chemical mixtures: a case study for cedarwood essential oilThe environmental risk assessment of UVCBs (i.e., substances of unknown or variable composition, complex reaction products, or biological materials) is challenging due to their inherent complexity. A particular problem is that UVCBs can contain constituents with unidentified chemical structures and/or have variable composition of constituents from batch to batch. Moreover, the composition of a UVCB in the environment is not the same as that of the UVCB in a product, meaning that a risk assessment based on environmental exposure to the UVCB in a product does not represent the actual environmental risk. Here we propose an in silico fate-directed risk assessment framework for UVCBs using cedarwood oil as a case study. The framework uses Monte Carlo simulations and the mass-balance models SimpleTreat and RAIDAR to provide quantitative information on whether unidentified constituents within the physical-chemical property space of a UVCB can be the decisive factor for the environmental risk of the entire UVCB. Thereby the framework provides a robust decision tool to evaluate if a UVCB risk assessment requires additional tests or if the data on known constituents is representative for the risk of the entire UVCB. In the case of cedarwood oil, it could be shown that a risk assessment based on the known constituents (representing around 70% of the overall UVCB by weight) is representative for the environmental risk of the entire UVCB - reducing the need for additional testing and test animals."

However, several limitations still have to be addressed, such as the major loss pathway through charge recombination at the dye-semiconductor interface. Charge separating dyes constructed as push-pull systems can increase the spatial separation of electron and hole, decreasing the recombination rate. Here, a family of dyes, consisting of polyphenylamine donors, fluorene bridges, and perylene monoimide acceptors, was investigated in silico using a combination of semi-empirical nuclear dynamics and a quantum propagation of photoexcited electron and hole. To optimize the charge separation, several molecular design strategies were investigated, including modifying the donor molecule, increasing the \u03c0-bridge length, and decoupling the molecular components through steric effects. The combination of a triphenylamine donor, using an extended 2-fluorene \u03c0-bridge, and decoupling the different components by steric hindrance from side groups resulted in a dye with significantly improved charge separation properties in comparison to the original supramolecular complex."

  "description": "Longest Palindromic Substring in Sublinear TimeWe revisit the classic algorithmic problem of computing a longest palidromic substring. This problem is solvable by a celebrated O(n)-time algorithm [Manacher, J. ACM 1975], where n is the length of the input string. For small alphabets, O(n) is not necessarily optimal in the word RAM model of computation: a string of length n over alphabet [0, \u03c3) can be stored in O(n log \u03c3/log n) space and read in O(n log \u03c3/log n) time. We devise a simple O(n log \u03c3/log n)-time algorithm for computing a longest palindromic substring. In particular, our algorithm works in sublinear time if \u03c3 = 2o(log n). Our technique relies on periodicity and on the O(n log \u03c3/log n)-time constructible data structure of Kempa and Kociumaka [STOC 2019] that answers longest common extension queries in O(1) time."

  "description": "Making de Bruijn Graphs EulerianA directed multigraph is called Eulerian if it has a circuit which uses each edge exactly once. Euler's theorem tells us that a weakly connected directed multigraph is Eulerian if and only if every node is balanced. Given a collection S of strings over an alphabet \u03a3, the de Bruijn graph (dBG) of order k of S is a directed multigraph GS,k(V, E), where V is the set of length-(k \u2212 1) substrings of the strings in S, and GS,k contains an edge (u, v) with multiplicity mu,v, if and only if the string u[0] \u00b7 v is equal to the string u \u00b7 v[k \u2212 2] and this string occurs exactly mu,v times in total in strings in S. Let G\u03a3,k(V\u03a3,k, E\u03a3,k) be the complete dBG of \u03a3k. The Eulerian Extension (EE) problem on GS,k asks to extend GS,k with a set B of nodes from V\u03a3,k and a smallest multiset A of edges from E\u03a3,k to make it Eulerian. Note that extending dBGs is algorithmically much more challenging than extending general directed multigraphs because some edges in dBGs are by definition forbidden. Extending dBGs lies at the heart of sequence assembly [Medvedev et al., WABI 2007], one of the most important tasks in bioinformatics. The novelty of our work with respect to existing works is that we allow not only to duplicate existing edges of GS,k but to also add novel edges and nodes, in an effort to (i) connect multiple components and (ii) reduce the total EE cost. It is easy to show that EE on GS,k is NP-hard via a reduction from shortest common superstring. We further show that EE remains NP-hard, even when we are not allowed to add new nodes, via a highly non-trivial reduction from 3-SAT. We thus investigate the following two problems underlying EE in dBGs: 1. When GS,k is not weakly connected, we are asked to connect its d > 1 components using a minimum-weight spanning tree, whose edges are paths on the underlying G\u03a3,k and weights are the corresponding path lengths. This way of connecting guarantees that no new unbalanced node is added. We show that this problem can be solved in O(|V |k log d + |E|) time, which is nearly optimal, since the size of GS,k is \u0398(|V |k + |E|). 2. When GS,k is not balanced, we are asked to extend GS,k to HS,k(V \u222a B, E \u222a A) such that every node of HS,k is balanced and the total number |A| of added edges is minimized. We show that this problem can be solved in the optimal O(k|V | + |E| + |A|) time. Let us stress that, although our main contributions are theoretical, the algorithms we design for the above two problems are practical. We combine the two algorithms in one method that makes any dBG Eulerian; and show experimentally that the cost of the obtained feasible solutions on real-world dBGs is substantially smaller than the corresponding cost obtained by existing greedy approaches."

  "description": "On Strings Having the Same Length-k SubstringsLet Substrk(X) denote the set of length-k substrings of a given string X for a given integer k > 0. We study the following basic string problem, called z-Shortest Sk-Equivalent Strings: Given a set Sk of n length-k strings and an integer z > 0, list z shortest distinct strings T1,..., Tz such that Substrk(Ti) = Sk, for all i \u2208 [1, z]. The z-Shortest Sk-Equivalent Strings problem arises naturally as an encoding problem in many real-world applications; e.g., in data privacy, in data compression, and in bioinformatics. The 1-Shortest Sk-Equivalent Strings, referred to as Shortest Sk-Equivalent String, asks for a shortest string X such that Substrk(X) = Sk. Our main contributions are summarized below: Given a directed graph G(V, E), the Directed Chinese Postman (DCP) problem asks for a shortest closed walk that visits every edge of G at least once. DCP can be solved in \u00d5(|E||V |) time using an algorithm for min-cost flow. We show, via a non-trivial reduction, that if Shortest Sk-Equivalent String over a binary alphabet has a near-linear-time solution then so does DCP. We show that the length of a shortest string output by Shortest Sk-Equivalent String is in O(k + n2). We generalize this bound by showing that the total length of z shortest strings is in O(zk + zn2 + z2n). We derive these upper bounds by showing (asymptotically tight) bounds on the total length of z shortest Eulerian walks in general directed graphs. We present an algorithm for solving z-Shortest Sk-Equivalent Strings in O(nk + n2 log2 n + zn2 log n + |output|) time. If z = 1, the time becomes O(nk + n2 log2 n) by the fact that the size of the input is \u0398(nk) and the size of the output is O(k + n2)."

  "description": "Clarifying notes on the bonding analysis adopted by the energy decomposition analysisWe discuss the fundamental aspects of the EDA-NOCV method and address some critical comments that have been made recently. The EDA-NOCV method unlike most other methods focuses on the process of bond formation between the interacting species and not just only on the analysis of the finally formed bond. This is demonstrated using LiF as an example. There is a difference between the interactions between the initial species which form the bond and are also the final product of bond cleavage, and the interactions between the fragments in the eventually formed molecule. The flexibility of the method allows the choice of the interacting fragments which helps to identify the charge and electron configuration of the fragments which describe the bond. This is very helpful in cases where the bond may be described with several Lewis structures. We reject the idea that it would be a disadvantage to have \u201cbond path functions\u201d as the energy components in the EDA, which actually indicate the variability of the method. The bonding analysis in a different sequence of the bond formation gives important results for the various questions that can be asked. This is demonstrated by using CH2, CO2 and the formation of a guanine quartet as examples. The fact that a bond is always defined by the bound molecule, the fragments, and their states is universal and deeply physical, as we show here again for various examples. The results of the EDA-NOCV method are in full accordance with the physical mechanism of the chemical bond as revealed by Ruedenberg."

  "description": "Excess ribosomal protein production unbalances translation in a model of Fragile X SyndromeDysregulated protein synthesis is a core pathogenic mechanism in Fragile X Syndrome (FX). The mGluR Theory of FX predicts that pathological synaptic changes arise from the excessive translation of mRNAs downstream of mGlu1/5 activation. Here, we use a combination of CA1 pyramidal neuron-specific TRAP-seq and proteomics to identify the overtranslating mRNAs supporting exaggerated mGlu1/5 -induced long-term synaptic depression (mGluR-LTD) in the FX mouse model (Fmr1\u2212/y). Our results identify a significant increase in the translation of ribosomal proteins (RPs) upon mGlu1/5 stimulation that coincides with a reduced translation of long mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins. These changes are mimicked and occluded in Fmr1\u2212/y neurons. Inhibiting RP translation significantly impairs mGluR-LTD and prevents the length-dependent shift in the translating population. Together, these results suggest that pathological changes in FX result from a length-dependent alteration in the translating population that is supported by excessive RP translation."

  "description": "Assessing MP2 frozen natural orbitals in relativistic correlated electronic structure calculationsThe high computational scaling with the basis set size and the number of correlated electrons is a bottleneck limiting applications of coupled cluster algorithms, in particular for calculations based on two- or four-component relativistic Hamiltonians, which often employ uncontracted basis sets. This problem may be alleviated by replacing canonical Hartree-Fock virtual orbitals by natural orbitals (NOs). In this paper, we describe the implementation of a module for generating NOs for correlated wavefunctions and, in particular, second order M\u00f8ller-Plesset perturbation frozen natural orbitals (MP2FNOs) as a component of our novel implementation of relativistic coupled cluster theory for massively parallel architectures [Pototschnig et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 17, 5509, (2021)]. Our implementation can manipulate complex or quaternion density matrices, thus allowing for the generation of both Kramers-restricted and Kramers-unrestricted MP2FNOs. Furthermore, NOs are re-expressed in the parent atomic orbital (AO) basis, allowing for generating coupled cluster singles and doubles NOs in the AO basis for further analysis. By investigating the truncation errors of MP2FNOs for both the correlation energy and molecular properties - electric field gradients at the nuclei, electric dipole and quadrupole moments for hydrogen halides HX (X = F-Ts), and parity-violating energy differences for H2Z2 (Z = O-Se) - we find MP2FNOs accelerate the convergence of the correlation energy in a roughly uniform manner across the Periodic Table. It is possible to obtain reliable estimates for both energies and the molecular properties considered with virtual molecular orbital spaces truncated to about half the size of the full spaces. "

  "description": "Classical Force-Field Parameters for CsPbBr3Perovskite NanocrystalsUnderstanding the chemico-physical properties of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) requires exploration of the dynamic processes occurring at the NC surfaces, in particular at the ligand-NC interface. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under realistic conditions are a powerful tool to acquire this knowledge because they have good accuracy and are computationally cheap, provided that a set of force-field (FF) parameters is available. In this work, we employed a stochastic algorithm, the adaptive rate Monte Carlo method, to optimize FF parameters of cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbBr3) NCs passivated with typical organic molecules used in the synthesis of these materials: oleates, phosphonates, sulfonates, and primary and quaternary ammonium ligands. The optimized FF parameters have been obtained against MD reference trajectories computed at the density functional theory level on small NC model systems. We validated our parameters through a comparison of a wide range of nonfitted properties to experimentally available values. With the exception of the NC-phosphonate case, the transferability of the FF model has been successfully tested on realistically sized systems (>5 nm) comprising thousands of passivating organic ligands and solvent molecules, just as those used in experiments.

  "description": "Through-Space Stabilization of an Imidazolium Cation by Aromatic RingsImidazole-based compounds are widely found in natural products, synthetic molecules, and biomolecules. Noncovalent interactions between the imidazole ring and other functional groups play an important role in determining the function of diverse molecules. However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying noncovalent interactions between imidazoles and aromatic systems. In this work, we report physical-organic chemistry studies on 2-(2,6-diarylphenyl)-1H-imidazoles and their protonated forms to investigate the noncovalent interactions between the central imidazole ring and two flanking aromatic rings possessing substituents at the para/meta position. Hammett analysis revealed that pKavalues and proton affinities correlate well with Hammett \u03c3 values of para-substituents at the flanking rings. Additional quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital and energy decomposition analyses reveal that through-space \u03c0-\u03c0interactions and NH-\u03c0interactions contribute to the intramolecular stabilization of the imidazolium cation. The results are important because they clearly demonstrate that the imidazolium cation forms energetically favorable noncovalent interactions with aromatic rings via the through-space effect, a knowledge that can be used in rational drug and catalyst design."

  "description": "Multi-task learning to leverage partially annotated data for PPI interface predictionProtein protein interactions (PPI) are crucial for protein functioning, nevertheless predicting residues in PPI interfaces from the protein sequence remains a challenging problem. In addition, structure-based functional annotations, such as the PPI interface annotations, are scarce: only for about one-third of all protein structures residue-based PPI interface annotations are available. If we want to use a deep learning strategy, we have to overcome the problem of limited data availability. Here we use a multi-task learning strategy that can handle missing data. We start with the multi-task model architecture, and adapted it to carefully handle missing data in the cost function. As related learning tasks we include prediction of secondary structure, solvent accessibility,and buried residue. Our results show that the multi-task learning strategy significantly outperforms single task approaches. Moreover, only the multi-task strategy is able to effectively learn over a dataset extended with structural feature data, without additional PPI annotations. The multi-task setup becomes even more important, if the fraction of PPI annotations becomes very small: the multi-task learner trained on only one-eighth of the PPI annotations\u2014with data extension\u2014reaches the same performances as the single-task learner on all PPI annotations. Thus, we show that the multi-task learning strategy can be beneficial for a small training dataset where the protein\u2019s functional properties of interest are only partially annotated."

  "description": "Optimization of Peptide Linker-Based Fluorescent Ligands for the Histamine H1ReceptorThe histamine H1 receptor (H1R) has recently been implicated in mediating cell proliferation and cancer progression; therefore, high-affinity H1R-selective fluorescent ligands are desirable tools for further investigation of this behavior in vitro and in vivo. We previously reported a H1R fluorescent ligand, bearing a peptide-linker, based on antagonist VUF13816 and sought to further explore structure-activity relationships (SARs) around the linker, orthostere, and fluorescent moieties. Here, we report a series of high-affinity H1R fluorescent ligands varying in peptide linker composition, orthosteric targeting moiety, and fluorophore. Incorporation of a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) 630/650-based fluorophore conferred high binding affinity to our H1R fluorescent ligands, remarkably overriding the linker SAR observed in corresponding unlabeled congeners. Compound 31a, both potent and subtype-selective, enabled H1R visualization using confocal microscopy at a concentration of 10 nM. Molecular docking of 31a with the human H1R predicts that the optimized peptide linker makes interactions with key residues in the receptor."

  "description": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon growth in a benzene discharge explored by IR-UV action spectroscopyInfrared signatures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are detected towards many phases of stellar evolution. PAHs are major players in the carbon chemistry of the interstellar medium, forming the connection between small hydrocarbons and large fullerenes. However, as details on the formation of PAHs in these environments are still unclear, modeling their abundance and chemistry has remained far from trivial. By combining molecular beam mass-selective IR spectroscopy and calculated IR spectra, we analyze the discharge of benzene and identify resulting products including larger PAHs, radicals and intermediates that serve as promising candidates for radio astronomical searches. The identification of various reaction products indicates that different gas-phase reaction mechanisms leading to PAH growth must occur under the same conditions to account for all observed PAH-related species, thereby revealing the complex and interconnected network of PAH formation pathways. The results of this study highlight key (exothermic) reactions that need to be included in astrochemical models describing the carbon chemistry in our universe."

The bond activation reaction barrier decreases, for all sp-hybridized carbon centers, when the substituent X of the substrate is changed from X=F to I. Activation strain and energy decomposition analyses reveal that the enhanced reactivity along this series originates from (i) a less destabilizing activation strain due to an intrinsically weaker C(spn)\u2212X bond; and (ii) an increasingly more stabilizing electrostatic interaction between the catalyst and the substrate. The latter is a direct consequence of the more diffuse electron density and higher nuclear charge of the X atom in the C(spn)\u2212X bond when going from X=F to I, which, in turn, engages in a more favorable electrostatic attraction with the nucleus and electrons, respectively, of the palladium catalyst."

  "description": "GPCRs steer Gi and Gs selectivity via TM5-TM6 switches as revealed by structures of serotonin receptorsSerotonin (or 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter that activates 12 different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) through selective coupling of Gs, Gi, or Gq proteins. The structural basis for G protein subtype selectivity by these GPCRs remains elusive. Here, we report the structures of the serotonin receptors 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 with Gs, and 5-HT4 with Gi1. The structures reveal that transmembrane helices TM5 and TM6 alternate lengths as a macro-switch to determine receptor's selectivity for Gs and Gi, respectively. We find that the macro-switch by the TM5-TM6 length is shared by class A GPCR-G protein structures. Furthermore, we discover specific residues within TM5 and TM6 that function as micro-switches to form specific interactions with Gs or Gi. Together, these results present a common mechanism of Gs versus Gi protein coupling selectivity or promiscuity by class A GPCRs and extend the basis of ligand recognition at serotonin receptors."

These systems are now beginning to mature and provide the basis for the development of in vitro assays suitable to understand the biological processes involved in the multi-organ systems of the human body, and will improve strategies for diagnosis, prevention, therapies and precision medicine. Induced pluripotent stem cell lines are prone to phenotypic and genotypic changes and donor/clone dependent variability, which means that it is important to identify the most appropriate characterization markers and quality control measures when sourcing new cell lines and assessing differentiated cell and tissue culture preparations for experimental work. This paper considers those core quality control measures for human pluripotent stem cell lines and evaluates the state of play in the development of key functional markers for their differentiated cell derivatives to promote assurance of reproducibility of scientific data derived from pluripotent stem cell-based systems."

  "description": "Gastric Th17 Cells Specific for H+/K+-ATPase and Serum IL-17 Signature in Gastric AutoimmunityHuman gastric autoimmunity [autoimmune gastritis (AIG)] is characterized by inflammation of the gastric mucosa and parietal cell loss. The gastric parietal cell proton pump H+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (H+/K+-ATPase) is the major autoantigen in AIG. Our work aimed to investigate the gastric H+/K+-ATPase-specific T helper 17 (Th17) responses in AIG and serum interleukin (IL)-17 cytokine subfamily in AIG patients, in healthy subjects [healthy controls (HCs)], and in patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) without AIG. We analyzed the activation of gastric lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) by H+/K+-ATPase and the IL-17A and IL-17F cytokine production in eight patients with AIG and four HCs. Furthermore, we compared serum levels of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-17E, IL-22, and IL-23 in 43 AIG patients, in 47 HCs, and in 20 IDA patients without AIG. Gastric LPMCs from all AIG patients, but not those from HCs, were activated by H+/K+-ATPase and were able to proliferate and produce high levels of IL-17A and IL-17F. AIG patients have significantly higher serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E (393.3 \u00b1 410.02 pg/ml, 394.0 \u00b1 378.03 pg/ml, 300.46 \u00b1 303.45 pg/ml, 34.92 \u00b1 32.56 pg/ml, respectively) than those in HCs (222.99 \u00b1 361.24 pg/ml, 217.49 \u00b1 312.1 pg/ml, 147.43 \u00b1 259.17 pg/ml, 8.69 \u00b1 8.98 pg/ml, respectively) and those in IDA patients without AIG (58.06 \u00b1 107.49 pg/ml, 74.26 \u00b1 178.50 pg/ml, 96.86 \u00b1 177.46 pg/ml, 10.64 \u00b1 17.70 pg/ml, respectively). Altogether, our results indicate that IL-17A and IL-17F are produced in vivo in the stomach of AIG patients following activation with H+/K+-ATPase and that serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E levels are significantly elevated in AIG patients but not in patients without AIG. These data suggest a Th17 signature in AIG and that IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E may represent a relevant tool for AIG management."

  "description": "Phylogenetic Classification and Functional Review of AutotransportersAutotransporters are the core component of a molecular nano-machine that delivers cargo proteins across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Part of the type V secretion system, this large family of proteins play a central role in controlling bacterial interactions with their environment by promoting adhesion to surfaces, biofilm formation, host colonization and invasion as well as cytotoxicity and immunomodulation. As such, autotransporters are key facilitators of fitness and pathogenesis and enable co-operation or competition with other bacteria. Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of autotransporter sequences reported and a steady rise in functional studies, which further link these proteins to multiple virulence phenotypes. In this review we provide an overview of our current knowledge on classical autotransporter proteins, the archetype of this protein superfamily. We also carry out a phylogenetic analysis of their functional domains and present a new classification system for this exquisitely diverse group of bacterial proteins. The sixteen phylogenetic divisions identified establish sensible relationships between well characterized autotransporters and inform structural and functional predictions of uncharacterized proteins, which may guide future research aimed at addressing multiple unanswered aspects in this group of therapeutically important bacterial factors."

However, whether these different precursors act in an additive or complementary manner is not truly well understood. Here, we have evaluated how combinations of different NAD+ precursors influence intracellular NAD+ levels. We identified dihydronicotinic acid riboside (NARH) as a new NAD+ precursor in hepatic cells. Second, we demonstrate how NARH, but not any other NAD+ precursor, can act synergistically with nicotinamide riboside (NR) to increase NAD+ levels in cultured cells and in mice. Finally, we demonstrate that the large increase in NAD+ prompted by the combination of these two precursors is due to their chemical interaction and conversion to dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH). Altogether, this work demonstrates for the first time that NARH can act as a NAD+ precursor in mammalian cells and how different NAD+ precursors can interact and influence each other when co\u2010administered."

Unfortunately, Ct-MOMP is difficult to express in its native structure in the E. coli outer membrane (OM). Here, by co-expression of the Bam complex, we improved the expression and localization of recombinant Ct-MOMP in the E. coli OM. Under these conditions, recombinant Ct-MOMP appeared to assemble into a \u03b2-barrel conformation and express domains at the cell surface indicative of correct folding. The data indicate that limited availability of the Bam complex can be a bottleneck for the production of heterologous OM vaccine antigens, information that is also relevant for strategies aimed at producing recombinant OMV-based vaccines."

  "description": "Does parental exposure to nanoplastics modulate the response of Hediste diversicolor to other contaminants: A case study with arsenicPlastic pollution is a serious problem in aquatic systems throughout the world. Despite the increasing number of studies addressing the impact of macro- and microplastics on biota, there is still a significant knowledge gap regarding the effects of nanoplastics alone and in combination with other contaminants. Among the aquatic contaminants that may interact with nanoplastics is arsenic (As), a metalloid found in estuarine and coastal ecosystems, pernicious to benthic organisms. This study aimed to understand how a parental pre-exposure to 100 nm polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) would influence the response of Hediste diversicolor to exposure to arsenic in terms of behaviour, neurotransmission, antioxidant defences and oxidative damage, and energy metabolism. The obtained data revealed an increase in burrowing time and a significant inhibition in cholinesterase activity in all polychaetes exposed to As, regardless of the pre-exposure to PS NPs. Oxidative status was altered particularly in parentally exposed organisms, with damage detected in terms of lipid peroxidation at 50 \u03bcg/L and protein carbonylation at 50 and 250 \u03bcg As/L exposed organisms when compared to control. Overall, data shows that parental pre-exposure to plastics influences the response of aquatic organisms, increasing their susceptibility to other contaminants. Thus, more studies should be performed with other environmental contaminants, to better understand the potential increased risk associated with the presence of nanoplastics to aquatic ecosystems."

  "description": "Distinct cell type-specific protein signatures in GRN and MAPT genetic subtypes of frontotemporal dementiaFrontotemporal dementia is characterized by progressive atrophy of frontal and/or temporal cortices at an early age of onset. The disorder shows considerable clinical, pathological, and genetic heterogeneity. Here we investigated the proteomic signatures of frontal and temporal cortex from brains with frontotemporal dementia due to GRN and MAPT mutations to identify the key cell types and molecular pathways in their pathophysiology. We compared patients with mutations in the GRN gene (n = 9) or with mutations in the MAPT gene (n = 13) with non-demented controls (n = 11). Using quantitative proteomic analysis on laser-dissected tissues we identified brain region-specific protein signatures for both genetic subtypes. Using published single cell RNA expression data resources we deduced the involvement of major brain cell types in driving these different protein signatures. Subsequent gene ontology analysis identified distinct genetic subtype- and cell type-specific biological processes. For the GRN subtype, we observed a distinct role for immune processes related to endothelial cells and for mitochondrial dysregulation in neurons. For the MAPT subtype, we observed distinct involvement of dysregulated RNA processing, oligodendrocyte dysfunction, and axonal impairments. Comparison with an in-house protein signature of Alzheimer\u2019s disease brains indicated that the observed alterations in RNA processing and oligodendrocyte function are distinct for the frontotemporal dementia MAPT subtype. Taken together, our results indicate the involvement of different brain cell types and biological mechanisms in genetic subtypes of frontotemporal dementia. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparison of proteomic profiles of different disease entities can separate general neurodegenerative processes from disease-specific pathways, which may aid the development of disease subtype-specific treatment strategies."

Atypical chemokine receptors (ACKRs) are intrinsically biased GPCRs that engage \u03b2-arrestins but not G proteins, making them a model system for investigating the structural basis of \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Here, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on 13CH3-\u03b5\u2013methionine\u2013labeled ACKR3, revealing that \u03b2-arrestin recruitment is associated with conformational exchange at key regions of the extracellular ligand-binding pocket and intracellular \u03b2-arrestin\u2013coupling region. NMR studies of ACKR3 mutants defective in \u03b2-arrestin recruitment identified an allosteric hub in the receptor core that coordinates transitions among heterogeneously populated and selected conformational states. Our data suggest that conformational selection guides \u03b2-arrestin recruitment by tuning receptor dynamics at intracellular and extracellular regions."

  "description": "Online Versus Offline Peer Feedback in Higher Education: A Meta-AnalysisIn recent years, the technical possibilities of educational technologies regarding online peer feedback have developed rapidly. However, the impact of online peer feedback activities compared to traditional offline variants has not specifically been meta-analyzed. Therefore, the aim of the current meta-analysis is to do an in-depth comparison between online versus offline peer feedback approaches. An earlier and broader meta-analysis focusing on technology-facilitated peer feedback in general, was used as a starting point. We synthesized 12 comparisons between online and offline peer feedback in higher education, from 10 different studies. Moreover, we reviewed student perceptions of online peer feedback when these were included in the studies. The results show that online peer feedback is more effective than offline peer feedback, with an effect size of 0.33. Moreover, online peer feedback is more effective when the outcome measure is competence rather than self-efficacy for skills. In addition, students are mostly positive towards online peer feedback but also list several downsides. Finally, implications for online peer feedback in teaching practice are discussed and leads are identified for further research on this topic."

  "description": "Physiologically Based Toxicokinetic Modeling of Bisphenols in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) Accounting for Variations in Metabolic Rates, Brain Distribution, and Liver AccumulationBisphenol A (BPA) is an industrial chemical, which has raised human health and environmental concerns due to its endocrine-disrupting properties. BPA analogues are less well-studied despite their wide use in consumer products. These analogues have been detected in water and aquatic organisms around the world, with some analogues showing toxic effects in various species including fish. Here, we present novel organ-specific time-course distribution data of bisphenol Z (BPZ) in female zebrafish (Danio rerio), including concentrations in the ovaries, liver, and brain, a rarely sampled organ with high toxicological relevance. Furthermore, fish-specific in vitro biotransformation rates were determined for 11 selected bisphenols. A physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model was adapted for four of these bisphenols, which was able to predict levels in the gonads, liver, and brain as well as the whole body within a 2-5-fold error with respect to experimental data, covering several important target organs of toxicity. In particular, predicted liver concentrations improved compared to currently available PBTK models. Predicted data indicate that studied bisphenols mainly distribute to the carcass and gonads and less to the brain. Our model provides a tool to increase our understanding on the distribution and kinetics of a group of emerging pollutants."

  "description": "Rational Tuning of the Reactivity of Three-Membered Heterocycle Ring Openings via SN2 ReactionsThe development of small-molecule covalent inhibitors and probes continuously pushes the rapidly evolving field of chemical biology forward. A key element in these molecular tool compounds is the \u201celectrophilic trap\u201d that allows a covalent linkage with the target enzyme. The reactivity of this entity needs to be well balanced to effectively trap the desired enzyme, while not being attacked by off-target nucleophiles. Here we investigate the intrinsic reactivity of substrates containing a class of widely used electrophilic traps, the three-membered heterocycles with a nitrogen (aziridine), phosphorus (phosphirane), oxygen (epoxide) or sulfur atom (thiirane) as heteroatom. Using quantum chemical approaches, we studied the conformational flexibility and nucleophilic ring opening of a series of model substrates, in which these electrophilic traps are mounted on a cyclohexene scaffold (C6H10Y with Y=NH, PH, O, S). It was revealed that the activation energy of the ring opening does not necessarily follow the trend that is expected from C\u2212Y leaving-group bond strength, but steeply decreases from Y=NH, to PH, to O, to S. We illustrate that the HOMONu\u2013LUMOSubstrate interaction is an all-important factor for the observed reactivity. In addition, we show that the activation energy of aziridines and phosphiranes can be tuned far below that of the corresponding epoxides and thiiranes by the addition of proper electron-withdrawing ring substituents. Our results provide mechanistic insights to rationally tune the reactivity of this class of popular electrophilic traps and can guide the experimental design of covalent inhibitors and probes for enzymatic activity."

  "description": "The 1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition: From Conception to Quantum Chemical DesignThe 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (1,3-DCA) reaction, conceptualized by Rolf Huisgen in 1960, has proven immensely useful in organic, material, and biological chemistry. The uncatalyzed, thermal transformation is generally sluggish and unselective, but the reactivity can be enhanced by means of metal catalysis or by the introduction of either predistortion or electronic tuning of the dipolarophile. These promoted reactions generally go with a much higher reactivity, selectivity, and yields, often at ambient temperatures. The rapid orthogonal reactivity and compatibility with aqueous and physiological conditions positions the 1,3-DCA as an excellent bioorthogonal reaction. Quantum chemical calculations have been critical for providing an understanding of the physical factors that control the reactivity and selectivity of 1,3-DCAs. In silico derived design principles have proven invaluable for the design of new dipolarophiles with tailored reactivity. This review discusses everything from the conception of the 1,3-DCA all the way to the state-of-the-art methods and models used for the quantum chemical design of novel (bioorthogonal) reagents."

We recently reported the initial characterization of a NanoBRET-based conformational histamine H3 receptor (H3R) biosensor that allowed the detection of both (partial) agonism and inverse agonism on living cells in a microplate reader assay format upon stimulation with H3R ligands. In the current study, we have further characterized this H3R biosensor on intact cells by monitoring the effect of consecutive ligand injections in time and evaluating its compatibility with photopharmacological ligands that contain a light-sensitive azobenzene moiety for photo-switching. In addition, we have validated the H3R biosensor in membrane preparations and found that observed potency values better correlated with binding affinity values that were measured in radioligand competition binding assays on membranes. Hence, the H3R conformational biosensor in membranes might be a ready-to-use, high-throughput alternative for radioligand binding assays that in addition can also detect ligand efficacies with comparable values as the intact cell assay."

  "description": "Secondary Kinetic Peak in the Kohn-Sham Potential and Its Connection to the Response StepWe consider a prototypical 1D model Hamiltonian for a stretched heteronuclear molecule and construct individual components of the corresponding KS potential, namely, the kinetic, the N - 1, and the conditional potentials. These components show very special features, such as peaks and steps, in regions where the density is drastically low. Some of these features are quite well-known, whereas others, such as a secondary peak in the kinetic potential or a second bump in the conditional potential, are less or not known at all. We discuss these features building on the analytical model treated in Giarrusso et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2018, 14, 4151. In particular, we provide an explanation for the underlying mechanism which determines the appearance of both peaks in the kinetic potential and elucidate why these peaks delineate the region over which the plateau structure, due to the N - 1 potential, stretches. We assess the validity of the Heitler-London Ansatz at large but finite internuclear distance, showing that, if optimal orbitals are used, this model is an excellent approximation to the exact wave function. Notably, we find that the second natural orbital presents an extra node very far out on the side of the more electronegative atom."

  "description": "Identifying mutant-specific multi-drug combinations using comparative network reconstructionTargeted inhibition of aberrant signaling is an important treatment strategy in cancer, but responses are often short-lived. Multi-drug combinations have the potential to mitigate this, but to avoid toxicity such combinations must be selective and given at low dosages. Here, we present a pipeline to identify promising multi-drug combinations. We perturbed an isogenic PI3K mutant and wild-type cell line pair with a limited set of drugs and recorded their signaling state and cell viability. We then reconstructed their signaling networks and mapped the signaling response to changes in cell viability. The resulting models, which allowed us to predict the effect of unseen combinations, indicated that no combination selectively reduces the viability of the PI3K mutant cells. However, we were able to validate 25 of the 30 combinations that we predicted to be anti-selective. Our pipeline enables efficient prioritization of multi-drug combinations from the enormous search space of possible combinations."

To boost immune recognition of non- or low-immunogenic antigens, we developed a vaccine platform based on the conjugation of a target protein to a chimeric designer peptide (CDP) of bacterial origin. Here, we exploited this immune Boost (iBoost) technology to enhance the immune response against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. Despite its fundamental role during viral infection, RBD is only moderately immunogenic. Immunization studies in mice showed that the conjugation of CDP to RBD induced superior immune responses compared to RBD alone. CDP-RBD elicited cross-reactive antibodies against the variants of concern Delta and Omicron. Furthermore, hamsters vaccinated with CDP-RBD developed potent neutralizing antibody responses and were fully protected from lung lesion formation upon challenge with SARS-CoV-2. In sum, we show that the iBoost conjugate vaccine technology provides a valuable tool for both quantitatively and qualitatively enhancing anti-viral immunity."

Two Co(ii)-disulfide complexes [Co2(LxSSLx)(Cl)4] (x = 1 or 2; L1SSL1 = 2,2\u2032-disulfanediylbis(N,N-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethan-1-amine; L2SSL2 = 2,2\u2032-disulfanedylbis (N-((6-methylpyridin-2-yl)methyl)-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl) ethan-1-amine) have been successfully converted with high yield to their corresponding Co(iii)-thiolate complexes upon addition of the ligand 8-quinolinolate. Using density functional theory (DFT) computations the d-orbital splitting energies of the cobalt-thiolate compounds [Co(L1S)(quin)]+ and [Co(L2S)(quin)]+ were estimated to be 3.10 eV and 3.07 eV, indicating a slightly smaller ligand-field strength of ligand L2SSL2 than of L1SSL1. Furthermore, the orientation of the quin\u2212 ligand in the thiolate compounds determines the stability of the thiolate complex. DFT computations show that the thiolate structure benefits from more electrostatic attraction when the oxygen atom of the quin\u2212 ligand is positioned trans to the sulfur atom of the [Co(L1S)]2+ fragment. Quin\u2212 is the first auxiliary ligand with which it appeared possible to induce the redox-conversion reaction in cobalt(ii) compounds of the relatively weak-field ligand L2SSL2"

  "description": "Recycling gradient-elution liquid chromatography for the analysis of chemical-composition distributions of polymersSynthetic polymers typically show dispersity in molecular weight and potentially in chemical composition. For the analysis of the chemical-composition distribution (CCD) gradient liquid chromatography may be used. The CCD obtained using this method is often convoluted with an underlying molecular-weight distribution (MWD). In this paper we demonstrate that the influence of the MWD can be reduced using very steep gradients and that such gradients are best realized utilizing recycling gradient liquid chromatography (LC\u21bbLC). This method allows for a more-accurate determination of the CCD and the assessment of (approximate) critical conditions (if these exist), even when high-molecular-weight standards of narrow dispersity are not readily available. The performance and usefulness of the approach is demonstrated for several polystyrene standards, and for the separation of statistical copolymers consisting of styrene/methyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate/butyl methacrylate. For the latter case, approximate critical compositions of the copolymers were calculated from the critical compositions of two homopolymers and one copolymer of known chemical composition, allowing for a determination of the CCD of unknown samples. Using this approach it is shown that the copolymers elute significantly closer to the predicted critical compositions after recycling of the gradient. This is most clear for the lowest-molecular-weight copolymer (Mw = 4.2 kDa), for which the difference between measured and predicted elution composition decreases from 7.9% without recycling to 1.4% after recycling."

In addition to this inherent microheterogeneity, misassembling of antibodies can take place during production contributing to their macroheterogeneity. CZE-MS is a versatile and powerful technique which has demonstrated high potential for the assessment of both micro- and macroheterogeneity of mAbs. In this chapter, technical and practical considerations for the characterization of mAbs by CZE-MS are described. CE-MS interfacing, capillary coatings for the prevention of mAb adsorption, and sample preparation considerations are covered in detail. The assessment of the macro- and microheterogeneity is discussed and exemplified through three different approaches involving analysis of intact, enzymatically digested, and reduced antibodies. The examples also illustrate the use of two commercially available interfacing techniques (i.e., sheath liquid and sheathless) as well as different types of capillary coatings (positively charged and neutral coatings)."

  "description": "A Computational Toolbox to Investigate the Metabolic Potential and Resource Allocation in Fission YeastThe fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is a popular eukaryal model organism for cell division and cell cycle studies. With this extensive knowledge of its cell and molecular biology, S. pombe also holds promise for use in metabolism research and industrial applications. However, unlike the baker\u2019s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a major workhorse in these areas, cell physiology and metabolism of S. pombe remain less explored. One way to advance understanding of organism-specific metabolism is construction of computational models and their use for hypothesis testing. To this end, we leverage existing knowledge of S. cerevisiae to generate a manually curated high-quality reconstruction of S. pombe\u2019s metabolic network, including a proteome-constrained version of the model. Using these models, we gain insights into the energy demands for growth, as well as ribosome kinetics in S. pombe. Furthermore, we predict proteome composition and identify growth-limiting constraints that determine optimal metabolic strategies under different glucose availability regimes and reproduce experimentally determined metabolic profiles. Notably, we find similarities in metabolic and proteome predictions of S. pombe with S. cerevisiae, which indicate that similar cellular resource constraints operate to dictate metabolic organization. With these cases, we show, on the one hand, how these models provide an efficient means to transfer metabolic knowledge from a well-studied to a lesser-studied organism, and on the other, how they can successfully be used to explore the metabolic behavior and the role of resource allocation in driving different strategies in fission yeast."

  "description": "A Functional Carbohydrate Degrading Enzyme Potentially Acquired by Horizontal Gene Transfer in the Genome of the Soil Invertebrate Folsomia candidaHorizontal gene transfer (HGT) is defined as the acquisition by an organism of hereditary material from a phylogenetically unrelated organism. This process is mostly observed among bacteria and archaea, and considered less likely between microbes and multicellular eukaryotes. However, recent studies provide compelling evidence of the evolutionary importance of HGT in eukaryotes, driving functional innovation. Here, we study an HGT event in Folsomia candida (Collembola, Hexapoda) of a carbohydrate-active enzyme homologous to glycosyl hydrase group 43 (GH43). The gene encodes an N-terminal signal peptide, targeting the product for excretion, which suggests that it contributes to the diversity of digestive capacities of the detritivore host. The predicted \u03b1-L-arabinofuranosidase shows high similarity to genes in two other Collembola, an insect and a tardigrade. The gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli using a cell-free protein expression system. The expressed protein showed activity against p-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-L-arabinofuranoside. Our work provides evidence for functional activity of an HGT gene in a soil-living detritivore, most likely from a bacterial donor, with genuine eukaryotic properties, such as a signal peptide. Co-evolution of metazoan GH43 genes with the Panarthropoda phylogeny suggests the HGT event took place early in the evolution of this ecdysozoan lineage."

  "description": "A new use for old drugs: identifying compounds with an anti-obesity effect using a high through-put semi-automated Caenorhabditis elegans screening platformObesity is one of the most common global health problems for all age groups with obese people at risk of a variety of associated health complications. Consequently, there is a need to develop new therapies that lower body fat without the side effects. However, obesity is a complex and systemic disease, so that in vitro results are not easily translatable to clinical situations. A promising way to circumnavigate these issues is to reposition already approved drugs for new treatments, enabling a more streamlined drug discovery process due to the availability of pre-existing pharmacological and toxicological datasets. Chemical libraries, such as the Prestwick Chemical Library of 1200 FDA approved drugs, are available for this purpose. We have developed a simple semi-automated whole-organism approach to screening the Prestwick Chemical Library for those compounds which reduce fat content using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Our whole-organism approach to high-throughput screening identified 9 \u201clead\u201d compounds that reduced fat within 2 weeks in the model. Further screening and analysis provided 4 \u201chit\u201d compounds (Midodrine, Vinpocetine, Fenoprofen and Lamivudine) that showed significant promise as drugs to reduce fat levels. The effects of these candidates were found to further reduce fat content in nematodes where an nhr-49/PPAR mutation resulted in \u201coverweight\u201d worms. Upon unblinding the \u201chit\u201d compounds, they were found to have recently been shown to have anti-obesity effects in mammalian models too. In developing a whole-animal chemical screen to identify pharmacological agents as potential anti-obesity compounds, we demonstrate how chemical libraries can be rapidly and relatively cheaply profiled for active hits. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans thus enables drugs to be assessed for applicability in humans and provides a new incentive to explore drug repurposing as a feasible and efficient way to identify new anti-obesity compounds."

There is thus a pressing need for new treatment options. We report here a set of macrocyclic peptides that inhibit influenza A virus infection at low nanomolar concentrations by binding to hemagglutinin, selected using ultrahigh-Throughput screening of a diverse peptide library. The peptides are active against both H1 and H5 variants, with no detectable cytotoxicity. Despite the high sequence diversity across hits, all tested peptides were found to bind to the same region in the hemagglutinin stem by HDX-MS epitope mapping. A mutation in this region identified in an escape variant confirmed the binding site. This stands in contrast to the immunodominance of the head region for antibody binding and suggests that macrocyclic peptides from in vitro display may be well suited for finding new druggable sites not revealed by antibodies. Functional analysis indicates that these peptides stabilize the prefusion conformation of the protein and thereby prevent virus-cell fusion. High-Throughput screening of macrocyclic peptides is thus shown here to be a powerful method for the discovery of novel broadly acting viral fusion inhibitors with therapeutic potential. "

Here, we determine the cryo-EM structure of the muscle-type Torpedo receptor in complex with ScNtx, a recombinant short-chain \u03b1-neurotoxin. ScNtx is pinched between loop C on the principal subunit and a unique hairpin in loop F on the complementary subunit, thereby blocking access to the neurotransmitter binding site. ScNtx adopts a binding mode that is tilted toward the complementary subunit, forming a wider network of interactions than those seen in the long-chain \u03b1-Bungarotoxin complex. Certain mutations in ScNtx at the toxin-receptor interface eliminate inhibition of neuronal \u03b17 nAChRs, but not ofhuman muscle-type receptors. These observations explain why ScNtx binds more tightly to muscle-type receptors than neuronal receptors. Together, these data offer a framework for understanding subtype-specific actions of short-chain \u03b1-neurotoxins and inspire strategies for design of new snake antivenoms."

  "description": "Inhibition of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor AT2R is a novel therapeutic strategy for glioblastomaGlioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive malignant primary brain tumor with limited therapeutic options. We show that the angiotensin II (AngII) type 2 receptor (AT2R) is a therapeutic target for GBM and that AngII, endogenously produced in GBM cells, promotes proliferation through AT2R. We repurposed EMA401, an AT2R antagonist originally developed as a peripherally restricted analgesic, for GBM and showed that it inhibits the proliferation of AT2R-expressing GBM spheroids and blocks their invasiveness and angiogenic capacity. The crystal structure of AT2R bound to EMA401 was determined and revealed the receptor to be in an active-like conformation with helix- VIII blocking G-protein or \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. The architecture and interactions of EMA401 in AT2R differ drastically from complexes of AT2R with other relevant compounds. To enhance central nervous system (CNS) penetration of EMA401, we exploited the crystal structure to design an angiopep-2-tethered EMA401 derivative, A3E. A3E exhibited enhanced CNS penetration, leading to reduced tumor volume, inhibition of proliferation, and increased levels of apoptosis in an orthotopic xenograft model of GBM."

  "description": "Correlating biodegradation kinetics of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin to the dynamics of microbial communities originating from soil in Vietnam contaminated with herbicides and dioxinsWe studied the succession of bacterial communities during the biodegradation of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). The communities originated from a mesocosm with soil from Bien Hoa airbase in Vietnam heavily contaminated with herbicides and dioxins. They were grown in defined media with different carbon and Gibbs energy sources and 2,3,7,8-TCDD. Cultures with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the sole carbon and energy source degraded about 95% of 2,3,7,8-TCDD within 60\u2006days of cultivation. Those with an additional 1\u2006mM of vanillin did that in roughly 90\u2006days. Further 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that the increase in relative abundance of members belonging to the genera Bordetella, Sphingomonas, Proteiniphilum, and Rhizobium correlated to increased biodegradation of 2,3,7,8-TCDD in these cultures. A higher concentration of vanillin slowed down the biodegradation rate. Addition of alternative carbon and Gibbs energy sources, such as amino acids, sodium lactate and sodium acetate, even stopped the degradation of 2,3,7,8-TCDD completely. Bacteria from the genera Bordetella, Achromobacter, Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas dominated most of the cultures, but the microbial profiles also significantly differed between cultures as judged by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analyses. Our study indicates that 2,3,7,8-TCDD degradation may be stimulated by bacterial communities preadapted to a certain degree of starvation with respect to the carbon and energy source. It also reveals the succession and abundance of defined bacterial genera in the degradation process."

Herein, the competing intramolecular stabilization of uronic acid cations by the C-5 carboxylic acid or the C-4 acetyl group was studied with infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS). IRIS reveals that a mixture of bridged ions is formed, in which the mixture is driven towards the C-1,C-5 dioxolanium ion when the C-5,C-2-relationship is cis, and towards the formation of the C-1,C-4 dioxepanium ion when this relation is trans. Isomer-population analysis and interconversion barrier computations show that the two bridged structures are not in dynamic equilibrium and that their ratio parallels the density functional theory computed stability of the structures. These studies reveal how the intrinsic interplay of the different functional groups influences the formation of the different regioisomeric products."

  "description": "Computational Prediction of Tc-99 NMR Chemical Shifts in Technetium Complexes with Radiopharmaceutical ApplicationsThe Tc-99m nucleus is the most used nuclide in radiopharmaceuticals designed for imaging diagnosis. The metal can exist in nine distinct oxidation states and forms distinct coordination complexes with a variety of chelating agents and geometries. These complexes are usually characterized through Tc-99 NMR that is very sensitive to the Tc coordination sphere. Therefore, predicting Tc-99 NMR might be useful to assist experimentalists in structural characterization. In the present study, we propose three computational protocols for predicting Tc-99 NMR chemical shifts based on density functional theory calculations using relativistic and nonrelativistic Hamiltonians: the relativistic Model 1, the nonrelativistic Model 2, and the empirical nonrelativistic Model 3. In Models 2 and 3, the NMR-DKH basis set was used for all atoms, including the Tc, for which it was developed here. All models were applied for a set of 41 Tc-complexes with metal oxidation states 0, I, and V, for which the Tc-99 chemical shift was available experimentally. The mean absolute deviation and the mean relative deviation were 67 ppm and 4.8% (Model 1), 92 ppm and 6.2% (Model 2), and 65 ppm and 4.9% (Model 3), respectively. Last, the effect of the explicit solvent was evaluated for the [TcO2(en)2]+\u2500Tc(V) complex. The calculated results for the Tc-99 NMR chemical shift at SO-ZORA-SSB-D/TZ2P-ZORA/COSMO//TPSS/def2-SVP/IEF-PCM(UFF) show that the inclusion of 14 water molecules (first solvation shell) together with the implicit solvation model leads to an absolute deviation of only 7 ppm (0.3%) from the experimental value, indicating that the solvent effects play a key role in predicting Tc-99 NMR."

  "description": "New putative phenol oxidase in ascidian blood cellsThe phenol oxidase system is ancient and ubiquitously distributed in all living organisms. In various groups it serves for the biosynthesis of pigments and neurotransmitters (dopamine), defence reactions and tissue hardening. Ascidians belong to subphylum Tunicata, which is considered the closest living relative to Vertebrates. Two phenol oxidases previously described for ascidians are vertebrate-like and arthropod-like phenol oxidases. In our present study, we described a new ascidian protein, Tuphoxin, with putative phenol oxidase function, which bears no sequence similarity with two enzymes described previously. The closest related proteins to Tuphoxin are mollusc haemocyanins. Unlike haemocyanins, which are oxygen transporting plasma proteins, Tuphoxin is synthesised in ascidian blood cells and secreted in the extracellular matrix of the tunic\u2014ascidian outer coverings. Single mature transcript coding for this phenol oxidase can give several protein products of different sizes. Thus limited proteolysis of the initial protein is suggested. A unique feature of Tuphoxins and their homologues among Tunicata is the presence of thrombospondin first type repeats (TSP1) domain in their sequence which is supposed to provide interaction with extracellular matrix. The finding of TSP1 in the structure of phenol oxidases is new and we consider this to be an innovation of Tunicata evolutionary lineage."

  "description": "An excess of glycolytic enzymes under glucose-limited conditions may enable Saccharomyces cerevisiae to adapt to nutrient availabilityMicroorganisms, including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, express glycolytic proteins to a maximal capacity that (largely) exceeds the actual flux through the enzymes, especially at low growth rates. An open question is if this apparent expression level is really an overcapacity, or maintains the (optimal) enzyme capacity needed to carry flux at (very) low substrate availability. Here, we use computational modelling to suggest that yeast maintains a genuine excess of glycolytic enzymes at low specific growth rates. During fast fermentative growth at high glucose levels, the observed expression of the glycolytic enzymes matched the predicted optimal levels. We suggest that the excess glycolytic capacity at low glucose levels is apreparatory strategy in the adaptation to sugar fluctuations in the environment."

  "description": "Efficient simulation of resonance Raman spectra with tight-binding approximations to density functional theoryResonance Raman spectroscopy has long been established as one of the most sensitive techniques for detection, structure characterization, and probing the excited-state dynamics of biochemical systems. However, the analysis of resonance Raman spectra is much facilitated when measurements are accompanied by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that are expensive for large biomolecules. In this work, resonance Raman spectra are therefore computed with the Density Functional Tight-Binding (DFTB) method in the time-dependent excited-state gradient approximation. To test the accuracy of the tight-binding approximations, this method is first applied to typical resonance Raman benchmark molecules, such as \u03b2-carotene, and compared to results obtained with pure and range-separated exchange-correlation functionals. We then demonstrate the efficiency of the approach by considering a computationally challenging heme variation. Overall, we find that the vibrational frequencies and excited-state properties (energies and gradients) that are needed to simulate the spectra are reasonably accurate and suitable for interpretation of experiments. We can therefore recommend DFTB as a fast computational method to interpret resonance Raman spectra. "

  "description": "Assessing the feasibility of stationary-phase-assisted modulation for two-dimensional liquid-chromatography separationsTwo-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) offers great separation power for complex mixtures. The frequently encountered incompatibility of two orthogonal separation systems, however, makes its application complicated. Active-modulation strategies can reduce such incompatibility issues considerably. Stationary-phase-assisted modulation (SPAM) is the most-common of these techniques, but also the least robust due to the major disadvantage that analytes may elute prematurely. The range of liquid chromatography (LC) applications continues to expand towards ever more complex mixtures. Retention modelling is increasingly indispensable to comprehend and develop LC separations. In this research, a tool was designed to assess the feasibility of applying SPAM in 2DLC. Several parameters were investigated to accurately predict isocratic retention of analytes on trap columns under dilution-flow conditions. Model parameters were derived from scanning-gradient experiments performed on analytical columns. The trap-to-trap repeatability was found to be similar to the prediction error. Dead volumes for the trap columns could not be accurately determined through direct experimentation. Instead, they were extrapolated from dead-volume measurements on analytical columns. Several known retention models were evaluated. Better predictions were found using the quadratic model than with the log-linear (\u201clinear-solvent-strength\u201d) model. Steep scanning gradients were found to result in inaccurate predictions. The impact of the dilution flow on the retention of analytes proved less straightforward than anticipated. Under certain conditions dilution with a weaker eluent was found to be counter productive. A tool was developed to quantify the effect of the dilution flow and to predict whether SPAM could be applied in specific situations. For nine different analytes under 36 different sets of conditions and with three different modulation times, the SPAM tool yielded a correct assessment in more than 95% of all cases (less than 5% false positives plus false negatives)."

  "description": "Iodine Gauche Effect Induced by an Intramolecular Hydrogen BondThe gauche conformer in 1-X,2-Y-disubstituted ethanes, that is, the staggered orientation in which X and Y are in closer contact, is only favored for relatively small substituents that do not give rise to large X\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Y steric repulsion. For more diffuse substituents, weakly attractive orbital interactions between antiperiplanar bonds (i.e., hyperconjugation) cannot overrule the repulsive forces between X and Y. Our quantum chemical analyses of the rotational isomerism of XCH2CH2Y (X = F, OH; Y = I) at ZORA-BP86-D3(BJ)/QZ4P reveal that indeed the anti conformer is generally favored due to a less destabilizing I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7F and I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7O-H steric repulsion. The only case when the gauche conformer is preferred is when the hydroxyl hydrogen is oriented toward the iodine atom in the 2-iodoethanol. This is because of the significantly stabilizing covalent component of the I\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7H-O intramolecular hydrogen bond. Therefore, we show that strong intramolecular interactions can overcome the steric repulsion between bulky substituents in 1,2-disubstituted ethanes and cause the gauche effect. Our quantum chemical computations have guided nuclear magnetic resonance experiments that confirm the increase in the gauche population as X goes from F to OH. "

  "description": "Optical control of the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor with opto-prop-2: A cis-active azobenzene analog of propranololIn this study, we synthesized and evaluated new photoswitchable ligands for the beta-adrenergic receptors \u03b21-AR and \u03b22-AR, applying an azologization strategy to the first-generation beta-blocker propranolol. The resulting compounds (Opto-prop-1, -2, -3) have good photochemical properties with high levels of light-induced trans-cis isomerization (>94%) and good thermal stability (t1/2 > 10 days) of the resulting cis-isomer in an aqueous buffer. Upon illumination with 360-nm light to PSScis, large differences in binding affinities were observed for photoswitchable compounds at \u03b21-AR as well as \u03b22-AR. Notably, Opto-prop-2 (VUF17062) showed one of the largest optical shifts in binding affinities at the \u03b22-AR (587-fold, cis-active), as recorded so far for photoswitches of G protein-coupled receptors. We finally show the broad utility of Opto-prop-2 as a light-dependent competitive antagonist of the \u03b22-AR as shown with a conformational \u03b22-AR sensor, by the recruitment of downstream effector proteins and functional modulation of isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes."

  "description": "Approximate Circular Pattern MatchingWe investigate the complexity of approximate circular pattern matching (CPM, in short) under the Hamming and edit distance. Under each of these two basic metrics, we are given a length-n text T, a length-m pattern P, and a positive integer threshold k, and we are to report all starting positions (called occurrences) of fragments of T that are at distance at most k from some cyclic rotation of P. In the decision version of the problem, we are to check if there is any such occurrence. All previous results for approximate CPM were either average-case upper bounds or heuristics, with the exception of the work of Charalampopoulos et al. [CKP+, JCSS'21], who considered only the Hamming distance. For the reporting version of the approximate CPM problem, under the Hamming distance we improve upon the main algorithm of [CKP+, JCSS'21] from O(n+(n/m) k4) to O(n+(n/m) k3 log log k) time; for the edit distance, we give an O(nk2)-time algorithm. Notably, for the decision versions and wide parameter-ranges, we give algorithms whose complexities are almost identical to the state-of-the-art for standard (i.e., non-circular) approximate pattern matching: For the decision version of the approximate CPM problem under the Hamming distance, we obtain an O(n + (n/m) k2 log k/ log log k)-time algorithm, which works in O(n) time whenever k = O( p mlog log m/logm). In comparison, the fastest algorithm for the standard counterpart of the problem, by Chan et al. [CGKKP, STOC'20], runs in O(n) time only for k = O(\u221a m). We achieve this result via a reduction to a geometric problem by building on ideas from [CKP+, JCSS'21] and Charalampopoulos et al. [CKW, FOCS'20]. For the decision version of the approximate CPM problem under the edit distance, the O(nk log3 k) runtime of our algorithm near matches the O(nk) runtime of the Landau-Vishkin algorithm [LV, J. Algorithms'89] for approximate pattern matching under edit distance; the latter algorithm remains the fastest known for k = \u03a9(m2/5). As a stepping stone, we propose an O(nk log3 k)-time algorithm for solving the Longest Prefix k-Approximate Match problem, proposed by Landau et al. [LMS, SICOMP'98], for all k \u2208 {1, , k}. Our algorithm is based on Tiskin's theory of seaweeds [Tiskin, Math. Comput. Sci.'08], with recent advancements (see Charalampopoulos et al. [CKW, FOCS'22]), and on exploiting the seaweeds' relation to Monge matrices. In contrast, we obtain a conditional lower bound that suggests a polynomial separation between approximate CPM under the Hamming distance over the binary alphabet and its non-circular counterpart. We also show that a strongly subquadratic-time algorithm for the decision version of approximate CPM under edit distance would refute the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis."

  "description": "Nuclear magnetic resonance as a tool to determine chlorine percentage of chlorinated paraffin mixturesA new simple method for chlorine percentage calculations (method C), from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy, has been established and applied to an industrial chlorinated paraffin (CP) mixture and 13 single-chain CPs of known carbon chain lengths. Two modified methods (method A and B), originating from the work of Sprengel et al., have been utilized on the same single-chain mixtures. All samples were analysed by 1H NMR and two-dimensional heteronuclear quantum coherence (HSQC) for this purpose. All three methods worked well for medium chlorinated (45\u201355% Cl) single-chain mixtures of known carbon chain lengths. Method A yielded the best result for mixtures of lower chlorine content (<45% Cl), method C gave better estimations for higher chlorine contents (>55% Cl). Compared to Mohr's titration, method A showed a deviation of 0.7\u20137.8% (3.6% average), method B 4.1\u201311.3% (7.0% average) and method C 0.6\u201311.6% (5.2% average), for all 13 single-chain mixtures. The new method C is the only method that could be applied for determining the chlorine percentage of industrial mixtures of multiple, unknown chain lengths."
