  "description": "A schematic sampling protocol for contaminant monitoring in raptorsBirds of prey, owls and falcons are widely used as sentinel species in raptor biomonitoring programmes. A major current challenge is to facilitate large-scale biomonitoring by coordinating contaminant monitoring activities and by building capacity across countries. This requiressharing, dissemination and adoption of best practices addressed by theNetworking Programme Research and Monitoring for and with Raptors in Europe (EURAPMON) and now being advanced by the ongoing international COST Action European Raptor Biomonitoring Facility. The present perspective introduces a schematic sampling protocol for contaminant monitoring in raptors. We provide guidance on sample collection with a view to increasing sampling capacity across countries, ensuring appropriate quality of samples and facilitating harmonization of procedures to maximize the reliability, comparability and interoperability of data. The here presented protocol can be used by professionals and volunteers as a standard guide to ensure harmonised sampling methods for contaminant monitoring in raptors."

  "description": "Dynamic co-culture metabolic models reveal the fermentation dynamics, metabolic capacities and interplays of cheese starter culturesIn this study, we have investigated the cheese starter culture as a microbial community through a question: can the metabolic behaviour of a co-culture be explained by the characterized individual organism that constituted the co-culture? To address this question, the dairy-origin lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus thermophilusand Leuconostoc mesenteroides, commonly used in cheese starter cultures, were grown in pure and four different co-cultures. We used a dynamic metabolic modelling approach based on the integration of the genome-scale metabolic networks of the involved organisms to simulate the co-cultures. The strain-specific kinetic parameters of dynamic models were estimated using the pure culture experimentsand they were subsequently applied to co-culture models. Biomass, carbon source, lactic acid and most of the amino acid concentration profiles simulated by the co-culture models fit closely to the experimental resultsand the co-culture models explained the mechanisms behind the dynamic microbial abundance. We then applied the co-culture models to estimate further information on the co-cultures that could not be obtained by the experimental method used. This includes estimation of the profile of various metabolites in the co-culture medium such as flavour compounds producedand the individual organism level metabolic exchange flux profiles, which revealed the potential metabolic interactions between organisms in the co-cultures."

  "description": "Influence of short- And long-term exposure on the biodegradation capacity of activated sludge microbial communities in ready biodegradability testsReady biodegradability tests (RBTs) are extensively used to screen the potential of chemicals to be biodegraded. The use of RBT protocols often results in large variations of test results that may lead to wrong interpretations. The present study aims to obtain a fundamental understanding of this variability. For this, we subjected the compounds 4-chloroaniline (4CA), carbamazepine (CBZ), metformin (MET), and N-methylpiperazine (NMP) to a variety of different test conditions. Inocula from five local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) were used in an attempt to enhance the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 310 biodegradability tests. The biodegradation capacity in RBTs, community composition and adaptation of the communities were compared after one week of pre-exposure in batch and four months exposure in chemostat. The results confirm that none of the test compounds is readily biodegradable in the standard OECD 310 RBT. However, when pre-exposure under either batch or chemostat conditions was included, 4CA was degraded in some cases and less variability among different inocula was observed for the transformation of MET. Bacterial communities from the five locations were found to be significantly different in composition from one another. In addition, pre-treatment performed before the RBT significantly changed the composition of each community. Results of this experiment show that short-term pre-exposure may increase the absolute number of degraders and deserves to be further investigated as a potential method to reduce the outcome variability of RBTs."

  "description": "Past, present, and future developments in enantioselective analysis using capillary electromigration techniquesEnantioseparation of chiral products has become increasingly important in a large diversity of academic and industrial applications. The separation of chiral compounds is inherently challenging and thus requires a suitable analytical technique that can achieve high resolution and sensitivity. In this context, CE has shown remarkable results so far. Chiral CE offers an orthogonal enantioselectivity and is typically considered less costly than chromatographic techniques, since only minute amounts of chiral selectors are needed. Several CE approaches have been developed for chiral analysis, including chiral EKC and chiral CEC. Enantioseparations by EKC benefit from the wide variety of possible pseudostationary phases that can be employed. Chiral CEC, on the other hand, combines chromatographic separation principles with the bulk fluid movement of CE, benefitting from reduced band broadening as compared to pressure-driven systems. Although UV detection is conventionally used for these approaches, MS can also be considered. CE-MS represents a promising alternative due to the increased sensitivity and selectivity, enabling the chiral analysis of complex samples. The potential contamination of the MS ion source in EKC-MS can be overcome using partial-filling and counter-migration techniques. However, chiral analysis using monolithic and open-tubular CEC-MS awaits additional method validation and a dedicated commercial interface. Further efforts in chiral CE are expected toward the improvement of existing techniques, the development of novel pseudostationary phases, and establishing the use of chiral ionic liquids, molecular imprinted polymers, and metal-organic frameworks. These developments will certainly foster the adoption of CE(-MS) as a well-established technique in routine chiral analysis."

  "description": "Receptor-based in vitro activities to assess human exposure to chemical mixtures and related health impactsHumans are exposed to a large number of chemicals from sources such as the environment, food, and consumer products. There is growing concern that human exposure to chemical mixtures, especially during critical periods of development, increases the risk of adverse health effects in newborns or later in life. Historically, the one-chemical-at-a-time approach has been applied both for exposure assessment and hazard characterisation, leading to insufficient knowledge about human health effects caused by exposure to mixtures of chemicals that have the same target. To circumvent this challenge researchers can apply in vitro assays to analyse both exposure to and human health effects of chemical mixtures in biological samples. The advantages of using in vitro assays are: (i) that an integrated effect is measured, taking combined mixture effects into account and (ii) that in vitro assays can reduce complexity in identification of Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) in human tissues. We have reviewed the state-of-the-art on the use of receptor-based in vitro assays to assess human exposure to chemical mixtures and related health impacts. A total of 43 studies were identified, in which endpoints for the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the estrogen receptor (ER), and the androgen receptor (AR) were used. The majority of studies reported biological activities that could be associated with breast cancer incidence, male reproductive health effects, developmental toxicities, human demographic characteristics or lifestyle factors such as dietary patterns. A few studies used the bioactivities to check the coverage of the chemical analyses of the human samples, whereas in vitro assays have so far not regularly been used for identifying CECs in human samples, but rather in environmental matrices or food packaging materials. A huge field of novel applications using receptor-based in vitro assays for mixture toxicity assessment on human samples and effect-directed analysis (EDA) using high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) for identification of toxic compounds waits for exploration. In the future this could lead to a paradigm shift in the way we unravel adverse human health effects caused by chemical mixtures."

  "description": "Asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation to probe the dynamic association equilibria of \u03b2-D-galactosidaseProtein dynamics play a significant role in many aspects of enzyme activity. Monitoring of structural changes and aggregation of biotechnological enzymes under native conditions is important to safeguard their properties and function. In this work, the potential of asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) to study the dynamic association equilibria of the enzyme \u03b2-D-galactosidase (\u03b2-D-Gal) was evaluated. Three commercial products of \u03b2-D-Gal were investigated using carrier liquids containing sodium chloride or ammonium acetate, and the effect of adding magnesium (II) chloride to the carrier liquid was assessed. Preservation of protein structural integrity during AF4 analysis was essential and the influence of several parameters, such as the focusing step (including use of frit-inlet), cross flow, and injected amount, was studied. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to corroborate the in-solution enzyme oligomerization observed with AF4. In contrast to SEC, AF4 provided sufficiently mild separation conditions to monitor protein conformations without disturbing the dynamic association equilibria. AF4 analysis showed that ammonium acetate concentrations above 40 mM led to further association of the dimers (\u201ctetramerization\u201d) of \u03b2-D-Gal. Magnesium ions, which are needed to activate \u03b2-D-Gal, appeared to induce dimer association, raising justifiable questions about the role of divalent metal ions in protein oligomerization and on whether tetramers or dimers are the most active form of \u03b2-D-Gal."

A time-course bioassay based on high density well-plates was performed in parallel with high resolution mass spectrometry (MS), providing a straightforward and rapid procedure to simultaneously obtain chemical and biological information of active compounds. Through multiple nanofractionations into the same well-plate and comparisons of the orthogonal separation results of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC), the \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors can be accurately identified from co-eluates. The screening platform was comprehensively evaluated and validated, and was applied to the screenings of green tea polyphenols and Ginkgo folium flavonoids. After accurate peak shape and retention time matching between the bioactivity chromatograms and MS chromatograms, ten \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors were successfully screened out and identified. The proposed screening method is rapid, effective and can avoid ignoring low abundant/active inhibitors."

  "description": "Reducing the influence of geometry-induced gradient deformation in liquid chromatographic retention modellingRapid optimization of gradient liquid chromatographic (LC) separations often utilizes analyte retention modelling to predict retention times as function of eluent composition. However, due to the dwell volume and technical imperfections, the actual gradient may deviate from the set gradient in a fashion unique to the employed instrument. This makes accurate retention modelling for gradient LC challenging, in particular when very fast separations are pursued. Although gradient deformation has been addressed in method-transfer situations, it is rarely taken into account when reporting analyte retention parameters obtained from gradient LC data, hampering the comparison of data from various sources. In this study, a response-function-based algorithm was developed to determine analyte retention parameters corrected for geometry-induced deformations by specific LC instruments. Out of a number of mathematical distributions investigated as response-functions, the so-called \u201cstable function\u201d was found to describe the formed gradient most accurately. The four parameters describing the model resemble the statistical moments of the distribution and are related to chromatographic parameters, such as dwell volume and flow rate. The instrument-specific response function can then be used to predict the actual shape of any other gradient programmed on that instrument. To incorporate the predicted gradient in the retention modelling of the analytes, the model was extended to facilitate an unlimited number of linear gradient steps to solve the equations numerically. The significance and impact of distinct gradient deformation for fast gradients was demonstrated using three different LC instruments. As a proof of principle, the algorithm and retention parameters obtained on a specific instrument were used to predict the retention times on different instruments. The relative error in the predicted retention times went down from an average of 9.8% and 12.2% on the two other instruments when using only a dwell-volume correction to 2.1% and 6.5%, respectively, when using the proposed algorithm. The corrected retention parameters are less dependent on geometry-induced instrument effects."

  "description": "Lack of Cooperativity in the Triangular X3Halogen-Bonded Synthon?We have investigated 44 crystal structures, found in the Cambridge Structural Database, containing the X3 synthon (where X = Cl, Br, I) in order to verify whether three type II halogen-halogen contacts forming the synthon exhibit cooperativity. A hypothesis that this triangular halogen-bonded motif is stabilized by cooperative effects is postulated on the basis of structural data. However, theoretical investigations of simplified model systems in which the X3 motif is present demonstrate that weak synergy occurs only in the case of the I3 motif. In the present paper we computationally investigate crystal structures in which the X3 synthon is present, including halomesitylene structures, that are usually described as being additionally stabilized by a synergic interaction. Our computations find no cooperativity for halomesitylene trimers containing the X3 motif. Only in the case of two other structures containing the I3 synthon a very weak or weak synergy, i.e. the cooperative effect being stronger than -0.40 kcal mol-1, is found. The crystal structure of iodoform has the most pronounced cooperativity of all investigated systems, amounting to about 10% of the total interaction energy. "

Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis contributes to the pathogenesis are complex and not fully understood. To dissect the role of this axis in cancer, we discuss its ability to impinge on canonical and less conventional signaling networks in different cancer cell types; its bidirectional crosstalk, notably with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and other factors present in the TME; and the infiltration of immune cells that supporttumor progression. We discuss current and emerging avenues that target the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis. Coordinately targeting both RTKs and CXCR4/ACKR3 and/or CXCL12 is an attractive approach to consider in multitargeted cancer therapies. In addition, inhibiting infiltrating immune cells or reactivating the immune system along with modulating the CXCL12/CXCR4/ACKR3 axis in the TME has therapeutic promise. "

  "description": "Influence maximization in the presence of vulnerable nodes: A ratio perspectiveInfluence maximization is a key problem seeking to identify users who will diffuse information to influence the largest number of other users in a social network. A drawback of the influence maximization problem is that it could be socially irresponsible to influence users many of whom would be harmed, due to their demographics, health conditions, or socioeconomic characteristics (e.g., predominantly overweight people influenced to buy junk food). Motivated by this drawback and by the fact that some of these vulnerable users will be influenced inadvertently, we introduce the problem of finding a set of users (seeds) that limits the influence to vulnerable users while maximizing the influence to the non-vulnerable users. We define a measure that captures the quality of a set of seeds as an additively smoothed ratio (ASR) between the expected number of influenced non-vulnerable users and the expected number of influenced vulnerable users. Then, we develop methods which aim to find a set of seeds that maximizes the measure: greedy heuristics, an approximation algorithm, as well as several variations of the approximation algorithm. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate they substantially outperform a state-of-the-art competitor in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. We also demonstrate that the variations of our approximation algorithm offer different trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency."

Their comprehensive experimental characterization is generally not feasible, particularly for unculturable organisms. In principle, the full range of metabolic capabilities can be computed from an organism's annotated genome using metabolic network reconstruction. However, current computational methods cannot deal with genome-scale metabolic networks. Part of the problem is that these methods aim to enumerate all metabolic pathways, while computation of all (elementally balanced) conversions between nutrients and products would suffice. Indeed, the elementary conversion modes (ECMs, defined by Urbanczik and Wagner) capture the full metabolic capabilities of a network, but the use of ECMs has not been accessible until now. We explain and extend the theory of ECMs, implement their enumeration in ecmtool, and illustrate their applicability. This work contributes to the elucidation of the full metabolic footprint of any cell."

The CsPbBr3-Pb4S3Br2 nanocrystals are prepared by a two-step direct synthesis using preformed subnanometer CsPbBr3 clusters. Density functional theory calculations indicate the creation of a quasi-type II alignment at the heterointerface as well as the formation of localized trap states, promoting ultrafast separation of photogenerated excitons and carrier trapping, as confirmed by spectroscopic experiments. Postsynthesis reaction with either Cl- or I- ions delivers the corresponding CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Br2 and CsPbI3-Pb4S3Br2 heterostructures, thus enabling anion exchange only in the perovskite domain. An increased structural rigidity is conferred to the perovskite lattice when it is interfaced with the chalcohalide lattice.

  "description": "Discovery of Diaryl Ether Substituted Tetrahydrophthalazinones as TbrPDEB1 Inhibitors Following Structure-Based Virtual ScreeningSeveral members of the 3\u2032,5\u2032-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) family play an essential role in cellular processes, which has labeled them as interesting targets for various diseases. The parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei, causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, contains several cyclic AMP specific PDEs from which TbrPDEB1 is validated as a drug target. The recent discovery of selective TbrPDEB1 inhibitors has increased their potential for a novel treatment for this disease. Compounds characterized by a rigid biphenyl tetrahydrophthalazinone core structure were used as starting point for the exploration of novel TbrPDEB1 inhibitors. Using a virtual screening campaign and structure-guided design, diaryl ether substituted phthalazinones were identified as novel TbrPDEB1 inhibitors with IC50 values around 1 \u03bcM against T. brucei. This study provides important structure-activity relationship (SAR) information for the future design of effective parasite-specific PDE inhibitors."

  "description": "Different resource allocation in a Bacillus subtilis population displaying bimodal motilityTo cope with sudden changes in their environment, bacteria can use a bet-hedging strategy by dividing the population into cells with different properties. This so-called bimodal or bistable cellular differentiation is generally controlled by positive feedback regulation of transcriptional activators. Due to the continuous increase in cell volume, it is difficult for these activators to reach an activation threshold concentration when cells are growing exponentially. This is one reason why bimodal differentiation is primarily observed from the onset of the stationary phase when exponential growth ceases. An exception is the bimodal induction of motility in Bacillus subtilis, which occurs early during exponential growth. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain this, including double negative-feedback regulation and the stability of the mRNA molecules involved. In this study, we used fluorescence-assisted cell sorting to compare the transcriptome of motile and non-motile cells and noted that expression of ribosomal genes is lower in motile cells. This was confirmed using an unstable GFP reporter fused to the strong ribosomal rpsD promoter. We propose that the reduction in ribosomal gene expression in motile cells is the result of a diversion of cellular resources to the synthesis of the chemotaxis and motility systems. In agreement, single-cell microscopic analysis showed that motile cells are slightly shorter than non-motile cells, an indication of slower growth. We speculate that this growth rate reduction can contribute to the bimodal induction of motility during exponential growth."

The complete Gibbs free energy profiles for the oxidation of secondary hydroxy groups at C2, C3, and C4 were computed for methyl \u03b2-glucoside and methyl carba-\u03b2-glucoside. Both computations and oxidation experiments on carba-glucosides demonstrate the crucial role of the ring oxygen in the C3 regioselectivity observed during the oxidation of glucosides. Analysis of the model systems for oxidized methyl \u03b2-glucoside shows that the C3 oxidation product is intrinsically favored in the presence of the ring oxygen. Subsequent energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and Hirschfeld charge analysis reveal the role of the ring oxygen: it positively polarizes C1/C5 by inductive effects and disfavors any subsequent buildup of positive charge at neighboring carbon atoms, rendering C3 the most favored site for the \u03b2-hydride elimination."

  "description": "An Environmental Dilemma for China During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Explosion of Disposable Plastic WastesPlastic pollution control has been on top of the political agenda in China. In January 2020, China announced a phased ban on the production and usage of various types of single-use plastics as a solution to environmental pollution problems. However, the outbreak of COVID-19 seems to be a new obstacle to the ban on single-use plastic products. To basically satisfied the daily necessities and contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 under the background of the regular epidemic prevention and control in China, online ordering, contactless delivery and wearing mask have become an important and feasible way of daily life. However, the unrestrained use of disposable plastic bags, lunch boxes and masks within the nationwide quarantine leads to hundreds of millions of plastics wastes every day. The potential environmental pollution caused by the use of disposable plastic products during the pandemic should arouse social concern. The Chinese government should manage environmental protection in parallel with anti-pandemic endeavors as the situation of the pandemic evolves."

  "description": "Neurotoxicity and underlying cellular changes of 21 mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitorsInhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (cI) by rotenone and methyl-phenylpyridinium (MPP\u2009+) leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in man and rodents. To formally describe this mechanism of toxicity, an adverse outcome pathway (AOP:3) has been developed that implies that any inhibitor of cI, or possibly of other parts of the respiratory chain, would have the potential to trigger parkinsonian motor deficits. We used here 21 pesticides, all of which are described in the literature as mitochondrial inhibitors, to study the general applicability of AOP:3 or of in vitro assays that are assessing its activation. Five cI, three complex II (cII), and five complex III (cIII) inhibitors were characterized in detail in human dopaminergic neuronal cell cultures. The NeuriTox assay, examining neurite damage in LUHMES cells, was used as in vitro proxy of the adverse outcome (AO), i.e., of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This test provided data on whether test compounds were unspecific cytotoxicants or specifically neurotoxic, and it yielded potency data with respect to neurite degeneration. The pesticide panel was also examined in assays for the sequential key events (KE) leading to the AO, i.e., mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibition, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disturbed proteostasis. Data from KE assays were compared to the NeuriTox data (AO). The cII-inhibitory pesticides tested here did not appear to trigger the AOP:3 at all. Some of the cI/cIII inhibitors showed a consistent AOP activation response in all assays, while others did not. In general, there was a clear hierarchy of assay sensitivity: changes of gene expression (biomarker of neuronal stress) correlated well with NeuriTox data; mitochondrial failure (measured both by a mitochondrial membrane potential-sensitive dye and a respirometric assay) was about 10-260 times more sensitive than neurite damage (AO); cI/cIII activity was sometimes affected at\u2009>\u20091000 times lower concentrations than the neurites. These data suggest that the use of AOP:3 for hazard assessment has a number of caveats: (i) specific parkinsonian neurodegeneration cannot be easily predicted from assays of mitochondrial dysfunction; (ii) deriving a point-of-departure for risk assessment from early KE assays may overestimate toxicant potency."

  "description": "Serial propagation in water-in-oil emulsions selects for Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with a reduced cell size or an increased biomass yield on glucoseIn S. cerevisiae and many other micro-organisms an increase in metabolic efficiency (i.e. ATP yield on carbon) is accompanied by a decrease in growth rate. From a fundamental point of view, studying these yield-rate trade-offs provides insight in for example microbial evolution and cellular regulation. From a biotechnological point of view, increasing the ATP yield on carbon might increase the yield of anabolic products. We here aimed to select S. cerevisiae mutants with an increased biomass yield. Serial propagation of individual cells in water-in-oil emulsions previously enabled the selection of lactococci with increased biomass yields, and adapting this protocol for yeast allowed us to enrich an engineered Crabtree-negative S. cerevisiae strain with a high biomass yield on glucose. When we started the selection with an S. cerevisiae deletion collection, serial propagation in emulsion enriched hxk2\u0394 and reg1\u0394 strains with an increased biomass yield on glucose. Surprisingly, a tps1\u0394 strain was highly abundant in both emulsion- and suspension-propagated populations. In a separate experiment we propagated a chemically mutagenized S. cerevisiae population in emulsion, which resulted in mutants with a higher cell number yield on glucose, but no significantly changed biomass yield. Genome analyses indicate that genes involved in glucose repression and cell cycle processes play a role in the selected phenotypes. The repeated identification of mutations in genes involved in glucose-repression indicates that serial propagation in emulsion is a valuable tool to study metabolic efficiency in S. cerevisiae."

  "description": "A state-averaged orbital-optimized hybrid quantum\u2013classical algorithm for a democratic description of ground and excited statesIn the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, solving the electronic structure problem from chemistry is considered as the \u2018killer application\u2019 for near-term quantum devices. In spite of the success of variational hybrid quantum/classical algorithms in providing accurate energy profiles for small molecules, careful considerations are still required for the description of complicated features of potential energy surfaces. Because the current quantum resources are very limited, it is common to focus on a restricted part of the Hilbert space (determined by the set of active orbitals). While physically motivated, this approximation can severely impact the description of these complicated features. A perfect example is that of conical intersections (i.e. a singular point of degeneracy between electronic states), which are of primary importance to understand many prominent reactions. Designing active spaces so that the improved accuracy from a quantum computer is not rendered useless is key to finding useful applications of these promising devices within the field of chemistry. To answer this issue, we introduce a NISQ-friendly method called \u2018state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver\u2019 which combines two algorithms: (1) a state-averaged orbital-optimizer, and (2) a state-averaged VQE. To demonstrate the success of the method, we classically simulate it on a minimal Schiff base model (namely the formaldimine molecule CH2NH) relevant also for the photoisomerization in rhodopsin\u2014a crucial step in the process of vision mediated by the presence of a conical intersection. We show that merging both algorithms fulfil the necessary condition to describe the molecule\u2019s conical intersection, i.e. the ability to treat degenerate (or quasi-degenerate) states on the same footing."

It is a variation of the well-studied k-mismatch problem. A multitude of papers has been devoted to solving the k-CPM problem, but only average-case upper bounds are known. In this paper, we present the first non-trivial worst-case upper bounds for this problem. Specifically, we show an O(nk)-time algorithm and an [Formula presented]-time algorithm. The latter algorithm applies in an extended way a technique that was very recently developed for the k-mismatch problem Bringmann et al. (2019) [10]. A preliminary version of this work appeared at FCT 2019 [35]. In this version we improve the time complexity of the second algorithm from [Formula presented] to [Formula presented]."

In the last decade, the association of GPCRs with cancer has become apparent and offers new opportunities to target GPCRs in oncology. GPCR overexpression and mutations lead to aberrant activation of pro-oncogenic pathways inducing tumor progression. In this review, we describe how GPCRs activate some main signaling pathways that contribute to different cancer hallmarks, including cell transformation, proliferative signaling, immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Thereafter, we highlight different approaches to target GPCRs, including small molecules and biologics (e.g. monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies) and combinatorial (immuno)therapies that are emerging with promising effects for cancer treatment."

The mechanisms underlying long-term coexistence remain unclear as system-wide studies have been largely limited to engineered communities, ex situ adapted cultures or synthetic assemblies. Here, we show how kefir, a natural milk-fermenting community of prokaryotes (predominantly lactic and acetic acid bacteria) and yeasts (family Saccharomycetaceae), realizes stable coexistence through spatiotemporal orchestration of species and metabolite dynamics. During milk fermentation, kefir grains (a polysaccharide matrix synthesized by kefir microorganisms) grow in mass but remain unchanged in composition. In contrast, the milk is colonized in a sequential manner in which early members open the niche for the followers by making available metabolites such as amino acids and lactate. Through metabolomics, transcriptomics and large-scale mapping of inter-species interactions, we show how microorganisms poorly suited for milk survive in\u2014and even dominate\u2014the community, through metabolic cooperation and uneven partitioning between grain and milk. Overall, our findings reveal how inter-species interactions partitioned in space and time lead to stable coexistence."

We found that the reaction barrier of the Lewis acid-catalyzed epoxide ring-opening reactions decreases upon ascending in group 1 along the series Cs+ > Rb+ > K+ > Na+ > Li+ > H+. Our activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that the enhanced reactivity of the Lewis acid-catalyzed ring-opening reaction is caused by the reduced steric (Pauli) repulsion between the filled orbitals of the epoxide and the nucleophile, as the Lewis acid polarizes the filled orbitals of the epoxide more efficiently away from the incoming nucleophile. Furthermore, we established that the regioselectivity of these ring-opening reactions is, aside from the \"classical\"strain control, also dictated by a hitherto unknown mechanism, namely, the steric (Pauli) repulsion between the nucleophile and the substrate, which could be traced back to the asymmetric orbital density on the epoxide. In all, this work again demonstrates that the concept of Pauli-lowering catalysis is a general phenomenon. "

  "description": "Intercellular communication induces glycolytic synchronization waves between individually oscillating cellsMany organs have internal structures with spatially differentiated and sometimes temporally synchronized groups of cells. The mechanisms leading to such differentiation and coordination are not well understood. Here we design a diffusion-limited microfluidic system to mimic a multicellular organ structure with peripheral blood flow and test whether a group of individually oscillating yeast cells could form subpopulations of spatially differentiated and temporally synchronized cells. Upon substrate addition, the dynamic response at single-cell level shows glycolytic oscillations, leading to wave fronts traveling through the monolayered population and to synchronized communities at well-defined positions in the cell chamber. A detailed mechanistic model with the architectural structure of the flow chamber incorporated successfully predicts the spatial-temporal experimental data, and allows for a molecular understanding of the observed phenomena. The intricate interplay of intracellular biochemical reaction networks leading to the oscillations, combined with intercellular communication via metabolic intermediates and fluid dynamics of the reaction chamber, is responsible for the generation of the subpopulations of synchronized cells. This mechanism, as analyzed from the model simulations, is experimentally tested using different concentrations of cyanide stress solutions. The results are reproducible and stable, despite cellular heterogeneity, and the spontaneous community development is reminiscent of a zoned cell differentiation often observed in multicellular organs."

Compliance with current regulation and future perspectivesCrumb rubber obtained from scrap tires is greatly employed for the construction of different facilities for sport, recreational and other uses. However, in recent years the concern about their safety and the related adult and children exposure to these surfaces is growing. This study aims a thorough chemical characterization encompassing 42 hazardous compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phthalates, adipates, antioxidants and vulcanization agents in a wide range of crumb rubber from different surfaces. For the extraction of the target compounds, a method based on ultrasound-assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UAE-GC\u2013MS/MS) has been validated. Forty crumb rubber samples coming from synthetic turf football pitches, outdoor and indoor playgrounds, urban pavements, commercial tiles and granulates, and scrap tires, were analyzed. In addition, green alternative materials, such as sand and artificial turf based on cork granulate infill were included to compare the levels of the target compounds with those of crumb rubber. Most of the analyzed recycled surfaces meet the recent limits proposed by the European Commission for rubber granulates and mulches, although they exceed in several cases the maximum levels allowed for rubber consumer products. Besides, most of the other target compounds, including several of them considered as endocrine disruptors, were detected in the analyzed samples, reaching parts per million concentrations."

  "description": "Nature of Alkali- and Coinage-Metal Bonds versus Hydrogen BondsWe have quantum chemically studied the structure and nature of alkali- and coinage-metal bonds (M-bonds) versus that of hydrogen bonds between A\u2212M and B\u2212 in archetypal [A\u2212M\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5B]\u2212 model systems (A, B=F, Cl and M=H, Li, Na, Cu, Ag, Au), using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-BP86-D3/TZ2P. We find that coinage-metal bonds are stronger than alkali-metal bonds which are stronger than the corresponding hydrogen bonds. Our main purpose is to understand how and why the structure, stability and nature of such bonds are affected if the monovalent central atom H of hydrogen bonds is replaced by an isoelectronic alkali- or coinage-metal atom. To this end, we have analyzed the bonds between A\u2212M and B\u2212 using the activation strain model, quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (MO) theory, energy decomposition analysis (EDA), and Voronoi deformation density (VDD) analysis of the charge distribution."

  "description": "Discovery of fragments inducing conformational effects in dynamic proteins using a second-harmonic generation biosensorBiophysical screening of compound libraries for the identification of ligands that interact with a protein is efficient, but does typically not reveal if (or how) ligands may interfere with its functional properties. For this a biochemical/functional assay is required. But for proteins whose function is dependent on a conformational change, such assays are typically complex or have low throughput. Here we have explored a high-throughput second-harmonic generation (SHG) biosensor to detect fragments that induce conformational changes upon binding to a protein in real time and identify dynamic regions. Multiwell plate format SHG assays were developed for wild-type and six engineered single-cysteine mutants of acetyl choline binding protein (AChBP), a homologue to ligand gated ion channels (LGICs). They were conjugated with second harmonic-active labelsviaamine or maleimide coupling. To validate the assay, it was confirmed that the conformational changes induced in AChBP by nicotinic acetyl choline receptor (nAChR) agonists and antagonists were qualitatively different. A 1056 fragment library was subsequently screened against all variants and conformational modulators of AChBP were successfully identified, with hit rates from 9-22%, depending on the AChBP variant. A subset of four hits was selected for orthogonal validation and structural analysis. A time-resolved grating-coupled interferometry-based biosensor assay confirmed the interaction to be a reversible 1-step 1\u2009:\u20091 interaction, and provided estimates of affinities and interaction kinetic rate constants (KD= 0.28-63 \u03bcM,ka= 0.1-6 \u03bcM\u22121s\u22121,kd=1 s\u22121). X-ray crystallography of two of the fragments confirmed their binding at a previously described conformationally dynamic site, corresponding to the regulatory site of LGICs. These results reveal that SHG has the sensitivity to identify fragments that induce conformational changes in a protein. A selection of fragment hits with a response profile different to known LGIC regulators was characterized and confirmed to bind to dynamic regions of the protein."

  "description": "Validating differential volatilome profiles in Parkinson's diseaseParkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that does not currently have a robust clinical diagnostic test. Nonmotor symptoms such as skin disorders have long since been associated with the disease, and more recently a characteristic odor emanating from the skin of people with Parkinson's has been identified. Here, dynamic head space (DHS) thermal desorption (TD) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is implemented to directly measure the volatile components of sebum on swabs sampled from people with Parkinson's-both drug na\u00efve and those on PD medications (n = 100) and control subjects (n = 29). Supervised multivariate analyses of data showed 84.4% correct classification of PD cases using all detected volatile compounds. Variable importance in projection (VIP) scores were generated from these data, which revealed eight features with VIP > 1 and p < 0.05 which all presented a downregulation within the control cohorts. Purified standards based on previously annotated analytes of interest eicosane and octadecanal did not match to patient sample data, although multiple metabolite features are annotated with these compounds all with high spectral matches indicating the presence of a series of similar structured species. DHS-TD-GC-MS analysis of a range of lipid standards has revealed the presence of common hydrocarbon species rather than differentiated intact compounds which are hypothesized to be breakdown products of lipids. This replication study validates that a differential volatile profile between control and PD cohorts can be measured using an analytical method that measures volatile compounds directly from skin swabs."

F- activates the nitrilimine, not CO2 as proposed in the literature, and imparts a significant rate enhancement for the cycloaddition. The origin of this catalysis is in the strength of the primary orbital interactions between the reactants. The Lewis base activated nitrilimine-F- has high-lying filled FMOs. The smaller FMO-LUMO gap promotes a rapid nucleophilic attack and overall cycloaddition with CO2. "

  "description": "Site-Specific N-Linked Glycosylation Analysis of Human Carcinoembryonic Antigen by Sheathless Capillary Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass SpectrometryWith 28 potential N-glycosylation sites, human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) bears an extreme amount of N-linked glycosylation, and approximately 60% of its molecular mass can be attributed to its carbohydrates. CEA is often overexpressed and released by many solid tumors, including colorectal carcinomas. CEA displays an impressive heterogeneity and variability in sugar content; however, site-specific distribution of carbohydrate structures has not been reported so far. The present study investigated CEA samples purified from human colon carcinoma and human liver metastases and enabled the characterization of 21 out of 28 potential N-glycosylation sites with respect to their occupancy. The coverage was achieved by a multienzymatic digestion approach with specific enzymes, such as trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and the nonspecific enzyme, Pronase, followed by analysis using sheathless CE-MS/MS. In total, 893 different N-glycopeptides and 128 unique N-glycan compositions were identified. Overall, a great heterogeneity was found both within (micro) and in between (macro) individual N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, notable differences were found on certain N-glycosylation sites between primary adenocarcinoma and metastatic tumor in regard to branching, bisection, sialylation, and fucosylation. Those features, if further investigated in a targeted manner, may pave the way toward improved diagnostics and monitoring of colorectal cancer progression and recurrence. Raw mass spectrometric data and Skyline processed data files that support the findings of this study are available in the MassIVE repository with the identifier MSV000086774 [DOI: 10.25345/C5Z50X]. "

  "description": "Generalization of Intrinsic Orbitals to Kramers-Paired Quaternion Spinors, Molecular Fragments, and Valence Virtual SpinorsLocalization of molecular orbitals finds its importance in the representation of chemical bonding (and antibonding) and in the local correlation treatments beyond mean-field approximation. In this paper, we generalize the intrinsic atomic and bonding orbitals [G. Knizia, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 11, 4834-4843] to relativistic applications using complex and quaternion spinors, as well as to molecular fragments instead of atomic fragments only. By performing a singular value decomposition, we show how localized valence virtual orbitals can be expressed on this intrinsic minimal basis. We demonstrate our method on systems of increasing complexity, starting from simple cases such as benzene, acrylic acid, and ferrocene molecules, and then demonstrate the use of molecular fragments and inclusion of relativistic effects for complexes containing heavy elements such as tellurium, iridium, and astatine. The aforementioned scheme is implemented into a standalone program interfaced with several different quantum chemistry packages."

  "description": "How metallylenes activate small moleculesWe have studied the activation of dihydrogen by metallylenes using relativistic density functional theory (DFT). Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses have quantified the physical factors behind the decreased reactivity of the metallylene on going down Group 14, from carbenes to stannylenes. Along this series, the reactivity decreases due to a worsening of the back-donation interaction between the filled lone-pair orbital of the metallylene and the \u03c3*-orbital of H2, which, therefore, reduces the metallylene-substrate interaction and increases the reaction barrier. As the metallylene ligand is varied from nitrogen to phosphorus to arsenic a significant rate enhancement is observed for the activation of H2due to (i) a reduced steric (Pauli) repulsion between the metallylene and the substrate; and (ii) less activation strain, as the metallylene becomes increasingly more predistorted. Using a rationally designed metallylene with an optimal Group 14 atom and ligand combination, we show that a number of small molecules (i.e.HCN, CO2, H2, NH3) may also be readily activated. For the first time, we show the ability of our H2activated designer metallylenes to hydrogenate unsaturated hydrocarbons. The results presented herein will serve as a guide for the rational design of metallylenes toward the activation of small molecules and subsequent reactions."

At odds with the commonly accepted view of chalcogen bonding as a predominantly electrostatic phenomenon, we find that chalcogen bonds, just as hydrogen and halogen bonds, have a significant covalent character stemming from strong HOMO\u2212LUMO interactions. Besides providing significantly to the bond strength, these orbital interactions are also manifested by the structural distortions they induce as well as the associated charge transfer from A\u2212 to D2Ch."

Our Kohn-Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) analyses reveal that hyperconjugative orbital interactions favor the gauche conformation in all cases (X = F\u2212I), not only for X = F as in the current model of this so-called gauche effect. We show that, instead, it is the interplay of hyperconjugation with Pauli repulsion between lone-pair-type orbitals on the halogen substituents that constitutes the causal mechanism for the gauche effect. Thus, only in the case of the relatively small fluorine atoms, steric Pauli repulsion is too weak to overrule the gauche preference of the hyperconjugative orbital interactions. For the larger halogens, X\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5X steric Pauli repulsion becomes sufficiently destabilizing to shift the energetic preference from gauche to anti, despite the opposite preference of hyperconjugation."

This modelling approach was applied to the South African Angora goat, that suffers from hypocortisolism caused by altered adrenal function. These animals are extremely vulnerable to cold stress, leading to substantial monetary loss in the mohair industry. The Angora goat has increased CYP17A1 17,20-lyase enzyme activity in comparison with hardy livestock species. Determining the effect of this altered adrenal function on adrenal steroidogenesis during a cold stress response is difficult. We developed a model describing adrenal steroidogenesis under control conditions, and under altered steroidogenic conditions where the animal suffers from hypocortisolism. The model is parameterised with experimental data from in vitro enzyme characterisations of a hardy control species. The increased 17,20-lyase activity of the Angora goat CYP17A1 enzyme was subsequently incorporated into the model and the response to physiological stress is simulated under both control and altered adrenal steroidogenic conditions."

A novel method for providing the test materials in aluminium strips was used. Thirty laboratories (88%) submitted data using their own method of choice, resulting in a variety of identification and quantification methods (n = 7). The majority of the labs (53\u2013100%) correctly identified the type of polymer in all samples but one. The performance of the laboratories in quantifying and weighing the pellets was very good. The analysis of the number of the particles in the soda tablets varied considerably between laboratories (29\u201391%). The results of this study highlight the complexity of microplastics analysis and the need for harmonization of both reporting format and methods. Continued development and assessment of the comparability among analytical methods and laboratories are urgently needed to support monitoring programmes, research and decision-making."

BDE209 was detected in most of the glaucous gull and sparrow hawk eggs but neither increasing nor decreasing trends in these BDE209 levels were observed. An indication for debromination of BDE209 in sparrowhawk eggs was found. BDE209 concentrations in sediments ranged from very low ng/g (88 ng/g on an organic carbon (OC) basis) concentrations, in the rivers Elbe, Ems, Seine and the Outer Humber, to high \u03bcg/g (120 \u03bcg/g OC), in the Western Scheldt, Liverpool Bay and River Mersey. Apart from decreasing values in the Western Scheldt sediment no further decreases in BDE209 concentrations were observed over time, neither in sediment nor in sewage sludge showing that the voluntary emissions control program of the bromine industry only had a local effect. In contrast to the sewage sludge samples from the Netherlands (mean 355 ng/g dry weight (dw) or 1026 ng/g OC), the BDE209 concentrations in the UK increased at all sites from 2006 to 2011 (8092 ng/g dw or 22,367 ng/g OC). The BDE209 levels in several UK sediments and sewage sludge were still very high at the end of the program in 2012, most likely caused by frequent use of BDE209 in the textile industry. This may be indicative of the persistence of BDE209 and the limited degradation into lower brominated congeners in sediment, although it cannot be excluded that ongoing BDE209 emissions have played a role as well."

  "description": "Optimization of a low flow sampler for improved assessment of gas and particle bound exposure to chlorinated paraffinsAn optimized low volume sampler was developed to determine both gas- and particle bound concentrations of short and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (S/MCCPs). Background contamination was limited by the sampler design, providing method quantification limits (MQLs) at least two orders of magnitude lower than other studies within the gas (MQL: 500 pg (\u03a3SCCPs), 1.86 ng (\u03a3MCCPs)) and particle (MQL: 500 pg (\u03a3SCCPs), 1.72 ng (\u03a3MCCPs) phases. Good repeatability was observed between parallel indoor measurements (RSD \u2264 9.3% (gas), RSD \u2264 14% (particle)) with no breakthrough/saturation observed after a week of continuous sampling. For indoor air sampling, SCCPs were dominant within the gas phase (17 \u00b1 4.9 ng/m3) compared to MCCPs (2.7 \u00b1 0.8 ng/m3) while the opposite was observed in the particle bound fraction (0.28 \u00b1 0.11 ng/m3 (\u03a3SCCPs) vs. 2.7 \u00b1 1.0 ng/m3 (\u03a3MCCPs)). Only SCCPs in the gas phase could be detected reliably during outdoor sampling and were considerably lower compared to indoor concentrations (0.27 \u00b1 0.10 ng/m3). Separation of the gas and particle bound phase was found to be crucial in applying the appropriate response factors for quantification based on the deconvoluted S/MCCP sample profile, thus avoiding over- (gas phase) or underestimation (particle phase) of reported concentrations. Very short chain chlorinated paraffins (vSCCPs, C5-C9) were also detected at equal or higher abundance compared to SCCP congener groups (C10-C13) congener groups, indicating an additional human indoor inhalation risk."

  "description": "Analysis of recycled rubber: Development of an analytical method and determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic compounds in rubber matricesRecycled crumb rubber (CR) is rich in compounds with unrecognized toxic potency; this study aims at the development of an analytical method that would allow identification and quantification of a very wide range of organic compounds extractable from the complex rubber matrix. The analytical set-up includes target analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and methyl-PAHs and suspect screening of raw extracts to tentatively identify primary organic compounds present, but not included in the standard target analysis of recycled rubber, followed by analytical method development and target analysis of identified compounds. Analyzed samples included weathered and new CR originating from football turf granulates, rubber mats, and end-of-life car tires (ELTs). The developed analytical method involves sonication extraction, followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) fractionation that enables simple and efficient separation of analytes with broad polarity scale. The application of SPE fractionation resolves coelution problems and simplifies the chromatograms. This analytical approach allowed to identify and quantify 46 sample specific compounds, including several heterocyclic PAHs like 2-methylthiobenzothiazole, benzonapthothiophenes, benzonaphthofuranes and aromatic amines like diphenylamine and N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine, which to our knowledge were not determined before. The PAHs concentrations determined in CR tiles purchased in Dutch and Spanish shops exceed the EU limits for articles marketed for use by the public. Furthermore, sets of methylated PAHs, dibenzothiazoles and aromatic amines were identified and quantified, and several other compounds were tentatively identified. The obtained results stress the need for expanding the list of target compounds analyzed in CR and the need for longitudinal studies on weathering processes taking place in CR."

Under net reductive conditions using commercial Hantzsch ester, the \u03b1-amino radical species underwent a single stereoselective cyclisation to give trans-configured amino-indane structures in good yield, whereas using a substituted Hantzsch ester as a milder reductant afforded cis-fused tetracyclic tetrahydroquinoline frameworks, resulting from two consecutive radical cyclisations. Judicious choice of the reaction conditions allowed libraries of both single and dual cyclisation products to be synthesised with high selectivity, notable predictability, and good-to-excellent yields. Computational analysis employing DFT revealed the reaction pathway and mechanistic rationale behind this finely balanced yet readily controlled photocatalytic system."

Inverted repeats are found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and they have been linked with countless possible functions. Many international consortia provide a comprehensive description of common genetic variation making alternative sequence representations, such as IUPAC encoding, necessary for leveraging the full potential of such broad variation datasets. Results: We present IUPACpal, an exact tool for efficient identification of inverted repeats in IUPAC-encoded DNA sequences allowing also for potential mismatches and gaps in the inverted repeats. Conclusion: Within the parameters that were tested, our experimental results show that IUPACpal compares favourably to a similar application packaged with EMBOSS. We show that IUPACpal identifies many previously unidentified inverted repeats when compared with EMBOSS, and thatthis is also performed with orders of magnitude improved speed."

  "description": "Combined cellomics and proteomics analysis reveals shared neuronal morphology and molecular pathway phenotypes for multiple schizophrenia risk genesAn enigma in studies of neuropsychiatric disorders is how to translate polygenic risk into disease biology. For schizophrenia, where > 145 significant GWAS loci have been identified and only a few genes directly implicated, addressing this issue is a particular challenge. We used a combined cellomics and proteomics approach to show that polygenic risk can be disentangled by searching for shared neuronal morphology and cellular pathway phenotypes of candidate schizophrenia risk genes. We first performed an automated high-content cellular screen to characterize neuronal morphology phenotypes of 41 candidate schizophrenia risk genes. The transcription factors Tcf4 and Tbr1 and the RNA topoisomerase Top3b shared a neuronal phenotype marked by an early and progressive reduction in synapse numbers upon knockdown in mouse primary neuronal cultures. Proteomics analysis subsequently showed that these three genes converge onto the syntaxin-mediated neurotransmitter release pathway, which was previously implicated in schizophrenia, but for which genetic evidence was weak. We show that dysregulation of multiple proteins in this pathway may be due to the combined effects of schizophrenia risk genes Tcf4, Tbr1, and Top3b. Together, our data provide new biological functions for schizophrenia risk genes and support the idea that polygenic risk is the result of multiple small impacts on common neuronal signaling pathways."

  "description": "Effect of Extreme Weather Events on Contaminant Transport From Urban Run-Off to a Fjord SystemUrbanization has resulted in increased contaminant run-off in densely populated areas. Climate change is expected to result in a higher frequency of extreme weather events including torrential rainfall and storms. The contaminant levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), chlorinated paraffins (CPF) and selected metals, in a small urban river were monitored during snow-melting and rainfall events to quantify the contribution to the contamination load of receiving waters of the inner Oslo fjord, Norway. Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was characterized with respect to levels of contaminants as well as toxic response using a battery of bioassays. The contaminant flux from the river to the fjord was quantified and assessed relative to sediment data. Historic data for near-shore sediment samples from the fjord were used to document urban input. The results show a clear episodic response in contaminant load emitted from the river to the fjord. The main historic input to the fjord was found to be PAH from pyrogenic sources like coal and wood burning as well as traffic. A significant reduction in the level of PAH was observed since the 1980s. The measured flux of CPF is consistent with on-going societal use despite a ban on the use of short chain CPF imposed in Norway from 2002."

  "description": "The proteome of granulovacuolar degeneration and neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer\u2019s diseaseGranulovacuolar degeneration (GVD) is a common feature in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). The occurrence of GVD is closely associated with that of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and GVD is even considered to be a pre-NFT stage in the disease process of AD. Currently, the composition of GVD bodies, the mechanisms associated with GVD and how GVD exactly relates to NFTs is not well understood. By combining immunohistochemistry (IHC) and laser microdissection (LMD) we isolated neurons with GVD and those bearing tangles separately from human post-mortem AD hippocampus (n = 12) using their typical markers casein kinase (CK)1\u03b4 and phosphorylated tau (AT8). Control neurons were isolated from cognitively healthy cases (n = 12). 3000 neurons per sample were used for proteome analysis by label free LC\u2013MS/MS. In total 2596 proteins were quantified across samples and a significant change in abundance of 115 proteins in GVD and 197 in tangle bearing neurons was observed compared to control neurons. With IHC the presence of PPIA, TOMM34, HSP70, CHMP1A, TPPP and VXN was confirmed in GVD containing neurons. We found multiple proteins localizing specifically to the GVD bodies, with VXN and TOMM34 being the most prominent new protein markers for GVD bodies. In general, protein groups relatedto protein folding, proteasomal function, the endolysosomal pathway, microtubule and cytoskeletal related function, RNA processing and glycolysis were found to be changed in GVD neurons. In addition to these protein groups, tangle bearing neurons show a decrease in ribosomal proteins, as well as in various proteins related to protein folding. This study, for the first time, provides a comprehensive human based quantitative assessment of protein abundances in GVD and tangle bearing neurons. In line with previous functional data showing that tau pathology induces GVD, our data support the model that GVD is part of a pre-NFT stage representing a phase in which proteostasis and cellular homeostasis is disrupted. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms and cellular processes affected in GVD and its relation to the presence of tau pathology is highly relevant for the identification of new drug targets for therapy."

  "description": "In vitro biotransformation and evaluation of potential transformation products of chlorinated paraffins by high resolution accurate mass spectrometryChlorinated paraffins (CPs) are high production chemicals, which leads to their ubiquitous presence in the environment. To date, few studies have measured CPs in humans and typically at relatively low concentrations, despite indications that exposure may be high compared to various persistent organic pollutants. The aim of this study is to investigate the in vitro biotransformation of CPs by human liver fractions. We determined the changes of the CP concentrations after the enzymatic transformation with human liver microsomes using a two-tiered in vitro approach. CP concentrations decreased with human liver microsomes, with the decreases of 33\u201394% after incubating with different groups of enzymes for 2 h. The profiles of CP rapidly shifted after the incubation with human liver microsomes. In addition, the concentrations of CPs and the biotransformation products were tentatively measured using high-resolution mass spectrometric analysis, including very short CP (carbon chain length <10), alcohols, ketones, and carboxylic acids. C\u2012C bond cleavage is a potential transformation pathway for CPs, and ketones are potential products of CP biotransformation, especially for long-chain CPs (C>17). The ketone products may be investigated as CP exposure biomarker in biomonitoring studies."

  "description": "A flat embedding method for transmission electron microscopy reveals an unknown mechanism of tetracyclineTransmission electron microscopy of cell sample sections is a popular technique in microbiology. Currently, ultrathin sectioning is done on resin-embedded cell pellets, which consumes milli- to deciliters of culture and results in sections of randomly orientated cells. This is problematic for rod-shaped bacteria and often precludes large-scale quantification of morphological phenotypes due to the lack of sufficient numbers of longitudinally cut cells. Here we report a flat embedding method that enables observation of thousands of longitudinally cut cells per single section and only requires microliter culture volumes. We successfully applied this technique to Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium bovis, and Acholeplasma laidlawii. To assess the potential of the technique to quantify morphological phenotypes, we monitored antibiotic-induced changes in B. subtilis cells. Surprisingly, we found that the ribosome inhibitor tetracycline causes membrane deformations. Further investigations showed that tetracycline disturbs membrane organization and localization of the peripheral membrane proteins MinD, MinC, and MreB. These observations are not the result of ribosome inhibition but constitute a secondary antibacterial activity of tetracycline that so far has defied discovery."

  "description": "Differential Involvement of ACKR3 C-Tail in \u03b2-Arrestin Recruitment, Trafficking and InternalizationBackground: The atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3) belongs to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Unlike classical GPCRs, this receptor does not activate G proteins in most cell types but recruits \u03b2-arrestins upon activation. ACKR3 plays an important role in cancer and vascular diseases. As recruitment of \u03b2-arrestins is triggered by phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail of GPCRs, we studied the role of different potential phosphorylation sites within the ACKR3 C-tail to further delineate the molecular mechanism of internalization and trafficking of this GPCR. Methods: We used various bioluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based sensors and techniques in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T cells expressing WT or phosphorylation site mutants of ACKR3 to measure CXCL12-induced recruitment of \u03b2-arrestins and G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), receptor internalization and trafficking. Results: Upon CXCL12 stimulation, ACKR3 recruits both \u03b2-arrestin 1 and 2 with equivalent kinetic profiles. We identified interactions with GRK2, 3 and 5, with GRK2 and 3 being important for \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. Upon activation, ACKR3 internalizes and recycles back to the cell membrane. We demonstrate that \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to the receptor is mainly determined by a single cluster of phosphorylated residues on the C-tail of ACKR3, and that residue T352 and in part S355 are important residues for \u03b2-arrestin1 recruitment. Phosphorylation of the C-tail appears essential for ligand-induced internalization and important for differential \u03b2-arrestin recruitment. GRK2 and 3 play a key role in receptor internalization. Moreover, ACKR3 can still internalize when \u03b2-arrestin recruitment is impaired or in the absence of \u03b2-arrestins, using alternative internalization pathways. Our data indicate that distinct residues within the C-tail of ACKR3 differentially regulate CXCL12-induced \u03b2-arrestin recruitment, ACKR3 trafficking and internalization."

(Thio)ureas render the studied Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition reactions exo selective and induce a significant acceleration of this process by lowering the reaction barrier by up to 7 kcal mol\u22121. Our activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analyses uncover that these organocatalysts enhance the Diels\u2013Alder reactivity by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled \u03c0-orbitals of the diene and dienophile, by polarizing the \u03c0-orbitals away from the reactive center and not by making the orbital interactions between the reactants stronger. In addition, we establish that the unprecedented exo selectivity of the hydrogen bond donor-catalyzed Diels\u2013Alder reactions is directly related to the larger degree of asynchronicity along this reaction pathway, which is manifested in a relief of destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion."

In this study we investigated the association of gut microbiota composition with language development of three-year-old rural Ugandan children.Methods We studied the language ability in 139 children of 36 months in our controlled maternal education intervention trial to stimulate children\u2019s growth and development. The dataset includes 1170 potential predictors, including anthropometric and cognitive parameters at 24 months, 542 composition parameters of the children\u2019s gut microbiota at 24 months and 621 of these parameters at 36 months. We applied a novel computationally efficient version of the all-subsets regression methodology and identified predictors of language ability of 36-months-old children scored according to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III).Results The best three-term model, selected from more than 266 million models, includes the predictors Coprococcus eutactus at 24 months of age, Bifidobacterium at 36 months of age, and language development at 24 months. The top 20 four-term models, selected from more than 77 billion models, consistently include Coprococcus eutactus abundance at 24 months, while 14 of these models include the other two predictors as well. Mann-Whitney U tests further suggest that the abundance of gut bacteria in language non-impaired children (n = 78) differs from that in language impaired children (n = 61) at 24 months. While obligate anaerobic butyrate-producers, including Coprococcus eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Holdemanella biformis, Roseburia hominis are less abundant, facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Granulicatella elegans, Escherichia/Shigella and Campylobacter coli, are more abundant in language impaired children. The overall predominance of oxygen tolerant species in the gut microbiota of Ugandan children at the age 24 months, expressed as the Metagenomic Aerotolerant Predominance Index (MAPI), was slightly higher in the language impaired group than in the non-impaired group (P = 0.09).Conclusions Application of the all-subsets regression methodology to microbiota data established a correlation between the relative abundance of the anaerobic butyrate-producing gut bacterium Coprococcus eutactus and language development in Ugandan children. We propose that the gut redox potential and the overall bacterial butyrate-producing capacity could be factors of importance as gut microbiota members with a positive correlation to language development are mostly strictly anaerobic butyrate-producers, while microbiota members that correlate negatively, are predominantly oxygen tolerant with a variety of known adverse effects."

  "description": "Do Sulfonamides Interact with Aromatic Rings?Aromatic rings form energetically favorable interactions with many polar groups in chemical and biological systems. Recent molecular studies have shown that sulfonamides can chelate metal ions and form hydrogen bonds, however, it is presently not established whether the polar sulfonamide functionality also interacts with aromatic rings. Here, synthetic, spectroscopic, structural, and quantum chemical analyses on 2,6-diarylbenzenesulfonamides are reported, in which two flanking aromatic rings are positioned close to the central sulfonamide moiety. Fine-tuning the aromatic character by substituents on the flanking rings leads to linear trends in acidity and proton affinity of sulfonamides. This physical-organic chemistry study demonstrates that aromatic rings have a capacity to stabilize sulfonamides via through-space NH\u2013\u03c0 interactions. These results have implications in rational drug design targeting electron-rich aromatic rings in proteins."

  "description": "How Oriented External Electric Fields Modulate ReactivityA judiciously oriented external electric field (OEEF) can catalyze a wide range of reactions and can even induce endo/exo stereoselectivity of cycloaddition reactions. The Diels\u2013Alder reaction between cyclopentadiene and maleic anhydride is studied by using quantitative activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital theory to pinpoint the origin of these catalytic and stereoselective effects. Our quantitative model reveals that an OEEF along the reaction axis induces an enhanced electrostatic and orbital interaction between the reactants, which in turn lowers the reaction barrier. The stronger electrostatic interaction originates from an increased electron density difference between the reactants at the reactive center, and the enhanced orbital interaction arises from the promoted normal electron demand donor\u2013acceptor interaction driven by the OEEF. An OEEF perpendicular to the plane of the reaction axis solely stabilizes the exo pathway of this reaction, whereas the endo pathway remains unaltered and efficiently steers the endo/exo stereoselectivity. The influence of the OEEF on the inverse electron demand Diels\u2013Alder reaction is also investigated; unexpectedly, it inhibits the reaction, as the electric field now suppresses the critical inverse electron demand donor\u2013acceptor interaction."

  "description": "Genome-wide data implicate terminal fusion automixis in king cobra facultative parthenogenesisFacultative parthenogenesis (FP) is widespread in the animal kingdom. In vertebrates it was first described in poultry nearly 70years ago, and since then reports involving other taxa have increased considerably. In the last two decades, numerous reports of FP have emerged in elasmobranch fishes and squamate reptiles (lizards and snakes), including documentation in wild populations of both clades. When considered in concert with recent evidence of reproductive competence, the accumulating data suggest that the significance of FP in vertebrate evolution has been largely underestimated. Several fundamental questions regarding developmental mechanisms, nonetheless, remain unanswered. Specifically, what is the type of automixis that underlies the production of progeny and how does this impact the genomic diversity of the resulting parthenogens? Here, we addressed these questions through the application of next-generation sequencing to investigate a suspected case of parthenogenesis in a king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah). Our results provide the first evidence of FP in this species, and provide novel evidence that rejects gametic duplication and supports terminal fusion as a mechanism underlying parthenogenesis in snakes. Moreover, we precisely estimated heterozygosity in parthenogenetic offspring and found appreciable retained genetic diversity that suggests that FP in vertebrates has underappreciated evolutionary significance."

  "description": "Viral G Protein-Coupled Receptors: Attractive Targets for Herpesvirus-Associated DiseasesHerpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that establish lifelong, latent infections in their host. Spontaneous reactivation of herpesviruses is often asymptomatic or clinically manageable in healthy individuals, but reactivation events in immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals can lead to severe morbidity and mortality. Moreover, herpesvirus infections have been associated with multiple proliferative cardiovascular and post-transplant diseases. Herpesviruses encode viral G protein-coupled receptors (vGPCRs) that alter the host cell by hijacking cellular pathways and play important roles in the viral life cycle and these different disease settings. In this review, we discuss the pharmacological and signaling properties of these vGPCRs, their role in the viral life cycle, and their contribution in different diseases. Because of their prominent role, vGPCRs have emerged as promising drug targets, and the potential of vGPCR-targeting therapeutics is being explored. Overall, these vGPCRs can be considered as attractive targets moving forward in the development of antiviral, cancer, and/or cardiovascular disease treatments. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In the last decade, herpesvirus-encoded G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have emerged as interesting drug targets with the growing understanding of their critical role in the viral life cycle and in different disease settings. This review presents the pharmacological properties of these viral receptors, their role in the viral life cycle and different diseases, and the emergence of therapeutics targeting viral GPCRs."

  "description": "Dispersion without Many-Body Density Distortion: Assessment on Atoms and Small MoleculesThe \"fixed diagonal matrices\"(FDM) dispersion formalism [ Kooi, D. P.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2019, 10, 1537 ] is based on a supramolecular wave function constrained to leave the diagonal of the many-body density matrix of each monomer unchanged, reducing dispersion to a balance between kinetic energy and monomer-monomer interaction. The corresponding variational optimization leads to expressions for the dispersion energy in terms of the ground-state pair densities of the isolated monomers only, providing a framework to build new approximations without the need for polarizabilities or virtual orbitals. Despite the underlying microscopic real space mechanism being incorrect, as in the exact case there is density relaxation, the formalism has been shown to give extremely accurate (or even exact) dispersion coefficients for H and He. The question we answer in this work is how accurate the FDM expressions can be for isotropic and anisotropic C6 dispersion coefficients when monomer pair densities are used from different levels of theory, namely Hartree-Fock, MP2, and CCSD. For closed-shell systems, FDM with CCSD monomer pair densities yield a mean average percent error for isotropic C6 dispersion coefficients of about 7% and a maximum absolute error within 18%, with a similar accuracy for anisotropies. The performance for open-shell systems is less satisfactory, with CCSD pair densities performing sometimes worse than Hartree-Fock or MP2. In the present implementation, the computational cost on top of the monomer's ground-state calculations is O(N4). The results show little sensitivity to the basis set used in the monomer's calculations."

  "description": "The Pauli Repulsion-Lowering Concept in CatalysisConspectusOrganic chemistry has undoubtedly had a profound impact on humanity. Day in and day out, we find ourselves constantly surrounded by organic compounds. Pharmaceuticals, plastics, fuels, cosmetics, detergents, and agrochemicals, to name a few, are all synthesized by organic reactions. Very often, these reactions require a catalyst in order to proceed in a timely and selective manner. Lewis acids and organocatalysts are commonly employed to catalyze organic reactions and are considered to enhance the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) interactions. A vast number of textbooks and primary literature sources suggest that the binding of a Lewis acid or an iminium catalyst to a reactant (R1) stabilizes its LUMO and leads to a smaller HOMO(R2)-LUMO(R1) energy gap with the other reactant (R2), thus resulting in a faster reaction. This forms the basis for the so-called LUMO-lowering catalysis concept. Despite the simplicity and popularity of FMO theory, a number of deficiencies have emerged over the years, as a consequence of these FMOs not being the operative factor in the catalysis. LUMO-lowering catalysis is ultimately incomplete and is not always operative in catalyzed organic reactions. Our groups have recently undertaken a concerted effort to generate a unified framework to rationalize and predict chemical reactivity using a causal model that is rooted in quantum mechanics. In this Account, we propose the concept of Pauli repulsion-lowering catalysis to understand the catalysis in fundamental processes in organic chemistry. Our findings emerge from state-of-the-art computational methods, namely, the activation strain model (ASM) of reactivity in conjunction with quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital theory (KS-MO) and a matching energy decomposition analysis (EDA). The binding of the catalyst to the substrate not only leads to a stabilization of its LUMO but also induces a significant reduction of the two-orbital, four-electron Pauli repulsion involving the key molecular orbitals of both reactants. This repulsion-lowering originates, for the textbook Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction, from the catalyst polarizing the occupied \u03c0orbital of the dienophile away from the carbon atoms that form new bonds with the diene. This polarization of the occupied dienophile \u03c0orbital reduces the occupied orbital overlap with the diene and constitutes the ultimate physical factor responsible for the acceleration of the catalyzed process as compared to the analogous uncatalyzed reaction. We show that this physical mechanism is generally applicable regardless of the type of reaction (Diels-Alder and Michael addition reactions) and the way the catalyst is bonded to the reactants (i.e., from pure covalent or dative bonds to weaker hydrogen or halogen bonds). We envisage that the insights emerging from our analysis will guide future experimental developments toward the design of more efficient catalytic transformations. "

  "description": "Controlling the selectivity of aminergic GPCR ligands from the extracellular vestibuleIn addition to the orthosteric binding pocket (OBP) of GPCRs, recent structural studies have revealed that there are several allosteric sites available for pharmacological intervention. The secondary binding pocket (SBP) of aminergic GPCRs is located in the extracellular vestibule of these receptors, and it has been suggested to be a potential selectivity pocket for bitopic ligands. Here, we applied a virtual screening protocol based on fragment docking to the SBP of the orthosteric ligand-receptor complex. This strategy was employed for a number of aminergic receptors. First, we designed dopamine D3 preferring bitopic compounds from a D2 selective orthosteric ligand. Next, we designed 5-HT2B selective bitopic compounds starting from the 5-HT1B preferring ergoline core of LSD. Comparing the serotonergic profiles of the new derivatives to that of LSD, we found that these derivatives became significantly biased towards the desired 5-HT2B receptor target. Finally, addressing the known limitations of H1 antihistamines, our protocol was successfully used to eliminate the well-known side effects related to the muscarinic M1 activity of amitriptyline while preserving H1 potency in some of the designed bitopic compounds. These applications highlight the usefulness of our new virtual screening protocol and offer a powerful strategy towards bitopic GPCR ligands with designed receptor profiles."

  "description": "An annotation database for chemicals of emerging concern in exposome researchBackground: Chemicals of Emerging Concern (CECs) include a very wide group of chemicals that are suspected to be responsible for adverse effects on health, but for which very limited information is available. Chromatographic techniques coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can be used for non-targeted screening and detection of CECs, by using comprehensive annotation databases. Establishing a database focused on the annotation of CECs in human samples will provide new insight into the distribution and extent of exposures to a wide range of CECs in humans. Objectives: This study describes an approach for the aggregation and curation of an annotation database (CECscreen) for the identification of CECs in human biological samples. Methods: The approach consists of three main parts. First, CECs compound lists from various sources were aggregated and duplications and inorganic compounds were removed. Subsequently, the list was curated by standardization of structures to create \u201cMS-ready\u201d and \u201cQSAR-ready\u201d SMILES, as well as calculation of exact masses (monoisotopic and adducts) and molecular formulas. The second step included the simulation of Phase I metabolites. The third and final step included the calculation of QSAR predictions related to physicochemical properties, environmental fate, toxicity and Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME) processes and the retrieval of information from the US EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard. Results: All CECscreen database and property files are publicly available (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3956586). In total, 145,284 entries were aggregated from various CECs data sources. After elimination of duplicates and curation, the pipeline produced 70,397 unique \u201cMS-ready\u201d structures and 66,071 unique QSAR-ready structures, corresponding with 69,526 CAS numbers. Simulation of Phase I metabolites resulted in 306,279 unique metabolites. QSAR predictions could be performed for 64,684 of the QSAR-ready structures, whereas information was retrieved from the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard for 59,739 CAS numbers out of 69,526 inquiries. CECscreen is incorporated in the in silico fragmentation approach MetFrag. Discussion: The CECscreen database can be used to prioritize annotation of CECs measured in non-targeted HRMS, facilitating the large-scale detection of CECs in human samples for exposome research. Large-scale detection of CECs can be further improved by integrating the present database with resources that contain CECs (metabolites) and meta-data measurements, further expansion towards in silico and experimental (e.g., MassBank) generation of MS/MS spectra, and development of bioinformatics approaches capable of using correlation patterns in the measured chemical features."

Weakly interacting LAs accelerate the Diels-Alder reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 3 kcal mol\u22121 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The reaction barriers systematically increase from halogen<hydrogen<chalcogen<pnictogen-bonded LAs, i. e., the latter have the least catalytic effect. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that these LAs lower the Diels-Alder reaction barrier by increasing the asynchronicity of the reaction to relieve the otherwise destabilizing Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled \u03c0-orbitals of diene and dienophile. Notably, the reactivity can be further enhanced on going from a Period 3 to a Period 5 LA, as these species amplify the asynchronicity of the Diels-Alder reaction due to a stronger binding to the dienophile. These findings again demonstrate the generality of the Pauli repulsion-lowering catalysis concept."

  "description": "Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in Swedish household dust and exposure of pet catsPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are used in a wide range of products and have been found ubiquitously in our indoor environment, and there is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse endocrine effects, such as thyroid hormone disruption. Pet cats have a high dust intake due to their grooming behavior and have been shown to be a suitable sentinel species for assessment of toddler\u2019s exposure. Here we used paired household dust (n=46) and cat serum (n=27) samples to establish whether dust is a relevant exposure pathway to PFASs. An analytical method for PFAS analysis was optimized using a low volume of cat serum samples, combining solid-phase extraction and online sample cleanup. Dust was extracted with methanol by sonication and cleaned up by addition of active carbon. In total, 27 PFASs were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. The correlation between PFAS levels in dust and serum, serum lipids and thyroid hormone levels, and PFAS levels in dust between different rooms were statistically evaluated. PFOS and PFDA could be quantified in all cat serum samples (median 2300 pg/mL and 430 pg/mL, respectively), followed by PFOA (median 1100 pg/mL), quantified in 96% of the samples. The levels of 6:2 and 8:2 diPAPs were determined in 65% and 92% of the serum samples, respectively, and were an order of magnitude lower (1.4\u2013160 pg/mL). Household dust on the other hand was dominated by 6:2 and 8:2 diPAPs, with a median of 65 ng/g dust and 49 ng/g dust, respectively. PFOS (median 13 ng/g dust) and PFOA (median 9 ng/g dust) were quantified in 93% of the dust samples. Only eight PFASs were detected (>LOD) in at least 50% of the samples of both matrices and could be paired. Significant correlations between cat serum and dust were found for PFOA (rS=0.32, p<0.049) and PFUnDA (rS=0.55, p<0.001). Significant positive correlations were found between serum total thyroxine (rS=0.11, p<0.05) and PFNA and between serum cholesterol and PFHpA (rS=0.46, p<0.01), PFUnDA (rS=0.40, p<0.05), PFDoDA (rS=0.44, p<0.01), and sum PFAS (rS=0.48, p<0.01). In conclusion, this study confirmed that dust is a relevant exposure pathway for the ingestion of some PFASs for cats, and the serum levels of PFASs could be of relevance for the cat\u2019s health."

This first study shows that cured do-it-yourself spray one-component SPFs (OCFs) often contain chlorinated paraffins (C14-C37), and tris (1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TCIPP), ranging 0.2\u201350%, and 0.9\u201330% w/w, respectively. Six OCFs contained CP levels ranging 22\u201350% w/w, whereas nine OCFs used for similar applications only contained CP levels ranging 2\u201317% w/w. It is unclear if the combination CPs/TCIPP is meant to improve the flame retardancy of products, and could suggest an unnecessary use of high CPs/TCIPP concentrations in OCFs. The two-component SPFs (TCFs) contained only TCIPP with levels ranging from 7.0% to 9.0%. The CPs and TCIPP were easily transferred from cured OCFs to the hands. Levels up to 590 \u00b5g per hand for CPs and up to 2.7 \u00b5g per hand for TCIPP were found. After end-of-life, it is challenging to recycle used SPFs. They may, therefore, end up at landfills where the TCIPP/CPs may leach into the environment. Therefore, further investigation is needed to assess potential exposure risks associated with general and occupational use, and the impact of landfill leaching on the environment."

  "description": "Conventional and high resolution chemical characterization to assess refinery effluent treatment performanceRefinery effluents represent an emission source of hydrocarbons (HCs) and other constituents to the environment. Thus, characterisation of effluent quality in terms of concentrations of key parameters relative to permitted standards is important and for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), the specific composition of the HC mixture can affect its toxicity to aquatic organisms. Therefore, this study was designed to analyse TPH, benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, xylenes (BTEX), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), (bio) chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen, total suspended solids and selected metals before, and after, treatment steps to demonstrate removal efficiencies across 13 refineries with variable wastewater treatment systems. Final discharge concentrations of the measured parameters were by 97% within the so called Best Available Technique Associated Emission Levels (BAT-AELs). Further, TPH composition was characterised using high-resolution two-dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) analysis to understand the mass distribution by carbon number and specific chemical class. Measurements were compared to SimpleTreat model predictions for validation. SimpleTreat successfully predicted the shape of the effluent composition since it is essentially a removal constant applied to the influent composition. The predictions were of similar magnitude as, or were greater than, the effluent concentrations since SimpleTreat is based on typical performance and is intended to be conservative. This was especially true for aromatic constituents. Reduction in potential HC exposures also coincided with a decrease in predicted toxicity using a mechanistic oil toxicity model, PETROTOX. Overall, the results indicate that EU petroleum refineries are likely to achieve a high performance level regarding effluent treatment."

  "description": "Business model innovation for sustainability: The role of stakeholder interaction and managerial cognitive changeBusiness model innovations emerge over time and are influenced by managerial interaction with stakeholders. Especially with regard to business model innovation for sustainability, manager\u2013stakeholder interaction can radically change a company\u2019s business model and underlying logic. However, the majority of the literature shows how manager\u2013stakeholder interaction may limit business model innovation when stakeholders reinforce existing managerial cognitions. In this chapter we study how stakeholders can also stimulate business model innovation by affecting managerial cognitive change. Through three case studies, we find that this can occur through three shaping processes: market approach shaping, product/service offering shaping, and credibility shaping. We also find that the impact of new or latent stakeholders is greater than that of existing stakeholders. We end the chapter by sketching a research agenda to further unravel the role of stakeholders affecting managerial cognition around business model innovation for sustainability."

  "description": "Designing Rh(I)-Half-Sandwich Catalysts for Alkyne [2+2+2] CycloadditionsMetal-mediated [2+2+2] cycloadditions of unsaturated molecules to cyclic and polycyclic organic compounds are a versatile synthetic route affording good yields and selectivity under mild conditions. In the last two decades, in silico investigations have unveiled important details about the mechanism and the energetics of the whole catalytic cycle. Particularly, a number of computational studies address the topic of half-sandwich catalysts which, due to their structural fluxionality, have been widely employed, since the 1980s. In these organometallic species, the metal is coordinated to an aromatic ring, typically the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl anion, C 5H 5-(Cp) or to the Cp moiety of a larger polycyclic aromatic ligand (Cp\u2032). During the catalytic process, the metal continuously 'slips' on the ring, changing its hapticity. This phenomenon of metal slippage and its implications for the catalyst's performance are discussed in this work, referring to the most important computational mechanistic studies reported in literature for Rh(I) half-metallocenes, with the purpose of providing hints for a rational design of this class of compounds. 1 Introduction 2 Mechanism of Metal-Catalyzed Acetylene [2+2+2] Cycloaddition to Benzene and the Problem of the Indenyl Effect 2.1 Acetylene-Acetonitrile [2+2+2] Co-cycloaddition to 2-Methylpyridine: Evidence of the Indenyl Effect 2.2 Heteroaromatic Catalysts and the Evidence of a Reverse Indenyl Effect 2.3 Booth's Mechanistic Hypothesis and the Evidence of the Indenyl Effect 3 Structure-Reactivity Correlation: The Slippage-Span Model 4 Conclusions and Perspectives."

  "description": "Heterologous Expression of ethA and katG in Mycobacterium marinum Enables the Rapid Identification of New Prodrugs Active against Mycobacterium tuberculosisScreening strategies for antituberculosis compounds using Mycobacterium tuberculosis are time consuming and require biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities, which makes the development of high-throughput assays difficult and expensive. Mycobacterium marinum, a close genetic relative of M. tuberculosis, possesses several advantages as a suitable model for tuberculosis drug screening. However, despite the high genetic similarity, there are some obvious differences in susceptibility to some tuberculosis drugs between these two species, especially for the prodrugs ethionamide and isoniazid. In this study, we aimed to improve M. marinum as a model for antituberculosis drug identification by heterologous expression of two common drug activators, EthA and KatG. These two activators were overexpressed in M. marinum, and the strains were tested against ethionamide, isoniazid, and a library of established antimycobacterial compounds from TB Alliance to compare drug susceptibility. Both in vitro and in vivo using zebrafish larvae, these genetically modified M. marinum strains showed significantly higher susceptibility against ethionamide and isoniazid, which require activation by EthA and KatG. More importantly, a strain overexpressing both ethA and katG was potentially more susceptible to approximately 20% of the antituberculosis hit compounds from the TB Alliance library. Most of these compounds were activated by EthA in M. marinum. Four of these compounds were selected for further analysis, and three of them showed obvious EthA-dependent activity against M. tuberculosis. Overall, our developed M. marinum strains are valuable tools for high-throughput discovery of potential novel antituberculosis prodrugs."

  "description": "Proton Transfer and SN2 Reactions as Steps of Fast Selenol and Thiol Oxidation in Proteins: A Model Molecular Study Based on GPxThe so-called peroxidatic cysteines and selenocysteines in proteins reduce hydroperoxides through a dual attack to the peroxide bond in a two-step mechanism. First, a proton dislocation from the thiol/selenol to a close residue of the enzymatic pocket occurs. Then, a nucleophilic attack of the anionic cysteine/selenocysteine to one O atom takes place, while the proton is shuttled back to the second O atom, promoting the formation of a water molecule. In this computational study, we use a molecular model of GPx to demonstrate that the enzymatic environment significantly lowers the barrier of the latter SN2 step. Particularly, in our Se-based model the energy barriers for the two steps are 29.82 and 2.83 kcal mol\u22121, both higher than the corresponding barriers computed in the enzymatic cluster, i. e., 21.60 and null, respectively. Our results, obtained at SMD-B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311+G(d,p), cc-pVTZ//B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-311G(d,p), cc-pVTZ level of theory, show that the mechanistic details can be well reproduced using an oversimplified model, but the energetics is definitively more favorable in the GPx active site. In addition, we pinpoint the role of the chalcogen in the peroxide reduction process, rooting the advantages of the presence of selenium in its acidic and nucleophilic properties."

  "description": "Structure Activity Relationship of N-Substituted Phenyldihydropyrazolones Against Trypanosoma cruzi AmastigotesCurrent drugs for Chagas disease have long treatment regimens with occurrence of adverse drug effects leading to poor treatment compliance. Novel and efficacious medications are therefore highly needed. We previously reported on the discovery of NPD-0227 (2-isopropyl-5-(4-methoxy-3-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one) as a potent in vitro inhibitor of Trypanosoma cruzi (pIC50 = 6.4) with 100-fold selectivity over human MRC-5 cells. The present work describes a SAR study on the exploration of substituents on the phenylpyrazolone nitrogen. Modifications were either done directly onto this pyrazolone nitrogen or alternatively by introducing a piperidine linker. Attention was pointed toward the selection of substituents with a cLogP preferably below NPD-0227s cLogP of 3.5. Generally the more apolar compounds showed better activities then molecules with cLogPs <2.0. Several new compounds were identified with potencies that are in the same range as NPD-0227 (pIC50 = 6.4) and promising selectivities. While the potency could not be improved, valuable SAR was obtained. Furthermore the introduction of a piperidine linker offers new opportunities for derivatization as valuable novel starting points for future T. cruzi drug discovery."

  "description": "Analysis of missense variants in the human histamine receptor family reveals increased constitutive activity of e4106.30\u00d730k variant in the histamine h1 receptorThe Exome Aggregation Consortium has collected the protein-encoding DNA sequences of almost 61,000 unrelated humans. Analysis of this dataset for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) proteins (available at GPCRdb) revealed a total of 463 naturally occurring genetic missense variations in the histamine receptor family. In this research, we have analyzed the distribution of these missense variations in the four histamine receptor subtypes concerning structural segments and sites important for GPCR function. Four missense variants R1273.52\u00d752H, R13934.57\u00d757H, R4096.29\u00d729H, and E4106.30\u00d730 K, were selected for the histamine H1 receptor (H1R) that were hypothesized to affect receptor activity by interfering with the interaction pattern of the highly conserved D(E)RY motif, the so-called ionic lock. The E4106.30\u00d730 K missense variant displays higher constitutive activity in G protein signaling as compared to wild-type H1R, whereas the opposite was observed for R1273.52\u00d752H, R13934.57\u00d757H, and R4096.29\u00d729H. The E4106.30\u00d730 K missense variant displays a higher affinity for the endogenous agonist histamine than wild-type H1R, whereas antagonist affinity was not affected. These data support the hypothesis that the E4106.30\u00d730 K mutation shifts the equilibrium towards active conformations. The study of these selected missense variants gives additional insight into the structural basis of H1R activation and, moreover, highlights that missense variants can result in pharmacologically different behavior as compared to wild-type receptors and should consequently be considered in the drug discovery process."

  "description": "Proteome constraints reveal targets for improving microbial fitness in nutrient-rich environmentsCells adapt to different conditions via gene expression that tunes metabolism for maximal fitness. Constraints on cellular proteome may limit such expression strategies and introduce trade-offs. Resource allocation under proteome constraints has explained regulatory strategies in bacteria. It is unclear, however, to what extent these constraints can predict evolutionary changes, especially for microorganisms that evolved under nutrient-rich conditions, i.e., multiple available nitrogen sources, such as Lactococcus lactis. Here, we present a proteome-constrained genome-scale metabolic model of L.lactis (pcLactis) to interpret growth on multiple nutrients. Through integration of proteomics and flux data, in glucose-limited chemostats, the model predicted glucose and arginine uptake as dominant constraints at low growth rates. Indeed, glucose and arginine catabolism were found upregulated in evolved mutants. At high growth rates, pcLactis correctly predicted the observed shutdown of arginine catabolism because limited proteome availability favored lactate for ATP production. Thus, our model-based analysis is able to identify and explain the proteome constraints that limit growth rate in nutrient-rich environments and thus form targets of fitness improvement."

  "description": "Combining High-Resolution Gas Chromatographic Continuous Fraction Collection with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: Possibilities of Analyzing a Whole GC ChromatogramThis study presents, for the first time, the successful application of analyzing a whole gas chromatography (GC) chromatogram by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy using a continuous repeatable and stable (n = 280) high-resolution (HR) GC fractionation platform with a 96-well plate. Typically with GC- or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, (isomer) standards and/or additional NMR analysis are needed to confirm the identification and/or structure of the analyte of interest. In the case of complex substances (e.g., UVCBs), isomer standards are often unavailable and NMR spectra too complex to achieve this. This proof of concept study shows that a HR GC fractionation collection platform was successfully applied to separate, purify, and enrich isomers in complex substances from a whole GC chromatogram, which would facilitate NMR analysis. As a model substance, a chlorinated paraffin (CP) mixture (>8,000 isomers) was chosen. NMR spectra were obtained from all 96 collected fractions, which provides important information for unravelling their full structure. As a proof of concept, a spectral interpretation of a few NMR spectra was made to assign sub-structures. More research is ongoing for the full characterization of CP isomers using multivariate statistical analysis. For the first time, up to only a few CP isomers per fraction were isolated from a highly complex mixture. These may be further purified and certified as standards, which are urgently needed, and can also be used for persistency, bioaccumulation, or toxicity studies. "

  "description": "Short\u2010 and long\u2010term social recognition memory are differentially modulated by neuronal histamineThe ability of recognizing familiar conspecifics is essential for many forms of social interaction including reproduction, establishment of dominance hierarchies, and pair bond formation in monogamous species. Many hormones and neurotransmitters have been suggested to play key roles in social discrimination. Here we demonstrate that disruption or potentiation of histaminergic neu-rotransmission differentially affects short (STM) and long\u2010term (LTM) social recognition memory. Impairments of LTM, but not STM, were observed in histamine\u2010deprived animals, either chronically (Hdc\u2212/\u2212 mice lacking the histamine\u2010synthesizing enzyme histidine decarboxylase) or acutely (mice treated with the HDC irreversible inhibitor \u03b1\u2010fluoromethylhistidine). On the contrary, restriction of histamine release induced by stimulation of the H3R agonist (VUF16839) impaired both STM and LTM. H3R agonism\u2010induced amnesic effect was prevented by pre\u2010treatment with donepezil, an ac-etylcholinesterase inhibitor. The blockade of the H3R with ciproxifan, which in turn augmented histamine release, resulted in a procognitive effect. In keeping with this hypothesis, the procognitive effect of ciproxifan was absent in both Hdc\u2212/\u2212 and \u03b1FMH\u2010treated mice. Our results suggest that brain histamine is essential for the consolidation of LTM but not STM in the social recognition test. STM impairments observed after H3R stimulation are probably related to their function as heterorecep-tors on cholinergic neurons."

  "description": "Online biophysical predictions for SARS-CoV-2 proteinsBACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, consists of an assembly of proteins that determine its infectious and immunological behavior, as well as its response to therapeutics. Major structural biology efforts on these proteins have already provided essential insights into the mode of action of the virus, as well as avenues for structure-based drug design. However, not all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, or regions thereof, have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, and as such might exhibit ambiguous, dynamic behaviour that is not evident from static structure representations, nor from molecular dynamics simulations using these structures. MAIN: We present a website ( https://bio2byte.be/sars2/ ) that provides protein sequence-based predictions of the backbone and side-chain dynamics and conformational propensities of these proteins, as well as derived early folding, disorder, \u03b2-sheet aggregation, protein-protein interaction and epitope propensities. These predictions attempt to capture the inherent biophysical propensities encoded in the sequence, rather than context-dependent behaviour such as the final folded state. In addition, we provide the biophysical variation that is observed in homologous proteins, which gives an indication of the limits of their functionally relevant biophysical behaviour.CONCLUSION: The https://bio2byte.be/sars2/ website provides a range of protein sequence-based predictions for 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, enabling researchers to form hypotheses about their possible functional modes of action."

  "description": "How does the composition of a PAH influence its microsolvation? A rotational spectroscopy study of the phenanthrene-water and phenanthridine-water clustersWe report on the noncovalent intermolecular interactions established between the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phenanthrene and phenanthridine with water. Such noncovalent interactions involving extended aromatic systems and water molecules are ubiquitous in a variety of chemical and biological systems. Our study provides spectroscopic results on simple model systems to understand the impact that an extended aromatic surface and the presence of a heteroatom have on the nature of the noncovalent interactions established with the solvent. Microhydrated phenanthrene and phenanthridine clusters with up to three water molecules have been observed and unambiguously characterised by means of broadband rotational spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the backbone of phenanthridine remarkably affects the geometries of the water clusters and the interaction networks at play, with O-H\u22efN and C-H\u22efO interactions becoming preferred in the phenanthridine-water clusters over the O-H\u22ef\u03c0 interactions seen in the phenanthrene-water clusters. The presence of this heteroatom induces nuclear quadrupole coupling, which was used to understand the cooperativity effects found with increasing cluster size. Our results provide important insight to draw a more complete picture of the noncovalent interactions involving solvent molecules and aromatic systems larger than benzene, and they can be significant to enhance our understanding of the aromatic-polar interactions at play in a myriad of chemical and biological contexts."

The absolute configuration of these compounds is, however, hard to determine as they only crystallize as racemic mixtures. In this work a Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) study is reported that provides an unambiguous determination of the absolute configuration of these compounds. An in-depth General Coupled Oscillator (GCO) analysis of the source of the VCD signal reveals that the unusual structure of these binaphthyl compounds inherently leads to strong and robust VCD bands. Combined with linear transit calculations, our VCD studies allow for the determination of key structural parameters."

  "description": "Anticoagulant Activity of Naja nigricollis Venom Is Mediated by Phospholipase A2 Toxins and Inhibited by VarespladibBites from elapid snakes typically result in neurotoxic symptoms in snakebite victims. Neurotoxins are, therefore, often the focus of research relating to understanding the pathogenesis of elapid bites. However, recent evidence suggests that some elapid snake venoms contain anticoagulant toxins which may help neurotoxic components spread more rapidly. This study examines the effects of venom from the West African black-necked spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis) on blood coagulation and identifies potential coagulopathic toxins. An integrated RPLC-MS methodology, coupled with nanofractionation, was first used to separate venom components, followed by MS, proteomics and coagulopathic bioassays. Coagulation assays were performed on both crude and nanofractionated N. nigricollis venom toxins as well as PLA2s and 3FTx purified from the venom. Assays were then repeated with the addition of either the phospholipase A2 inhibitor varespladib or the snake venom metalloproteinase inhibitor marimastat to assess whether either toxin inhibitor is capable of neutralizing coagulopathic venom activity. Subsequent proteomic analysis was performed on nanofractionated bioactive venom toxins using tryptic digestion followed by nanoLC-MS/MS measurements, which were then identified using Swiss-Prot and species-specific database searches. Varespladib, but not marimastat, was found to significantly reduce the anticoagulant activity of N. nigricollis venom and MS and proteomics analyses confirmed that the anticoagulant venom components mostly consisted of PLA2 proteins. We, therefore, conclude that PLA2s are the most likely candidates responsible for anticoagulant effects stimulated by N. nigricollis venom."

  "description": "Understanding FBA solutions under multiple nutrient limitationsGenome-scale stoichiometric modeling methods, in particular Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) and variations thereof, are widely used to investigate cell metabolism and to optimize biotechno-logical processes. Given (1) a metabolic network, which can be reconstructed from an organism\u2019s genome sequence, and (2) constraints on reaction rates, which may be based on measured nutrient uptake rates, FBA predicts which reactions maximize an objective flux, usually the production of cell components. Although FBA solutions may accurately predict the metabolic behavior of a cell, the actual flux predictions are often hard to interpret. This is especially the case for conditions with many constraints, such as for organisms growing in rich nutrient environments: it remains unclear why a certain solution was optimal. Here, we rationalize FBA solutions by explaining for which properties the optimal combination of metabolic strategies is selected. We provide a graphical formalism in which the selection of solutions can be visualized; we illustrate how this perspective provides a glimpse of the logic that underlies genome-scale modeling by applying our formalism to models of various sizes."

  "description": "Characterization of a liquid-core waveguide cell for studying the chemistry of light-induced degradationMany organic compounds undergo changes under the influence of light. This might be beneficial in, for example, water purification, but undesirable when cultural-heritage objects fade or when food ingredients (e.g., vitamins) degrade. It is often challenging to establish a strong link between photodegradation products and their parent molecules due to the complexity of the sample. To allow effective study of light-induced degradation (LID), a low-volume exposure cell was created in which solutes are efficiently illuminated (especially at low concentrations) while simultaneously analysed by absorbance spectroscopy. The new LID cell encompasses a gas-permeable liquid-core waveguide (LCW) connected to a spectrograph allowing collection of spectral data in real-time. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the overall performance of the LID cell by assessing its transmission characteristics, the absolute photon flux achieved in the LCW, and its capacity to study solute degradation in presence of oxygen. The potential of the LID set-up for light-exposure studies was successfully demonstrated by monitoring the degradation of the dyes eosin Y and crystal violet."

  "description": "Synergistic DNA- and Protein-Based Recognition Promote an RNA-Templated Bio-orthogonal ReactionBiomolecular assemblies composed of proteins and oligonucleotides play a central role in biological processes. While in nature, oligonucleotides and proteins usually assemble via non-covalent interactions, synthetic conjugates have been developed which covalently link both modalities. The resulting peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates have facilitated novel biological applications as well as the design of functional supramolecular systems and materials. However, despite the importance of concerted protein/oligonucleotide recognition in nature, conjugation approaches have barely utilized the synergistic recognition abilities of such complexes. Herein, the structure-based design of peptide-DNA conjugates that bind RNA through Watson-Crick base pairing combined with peptide-mediated major groove recognition is reported. Two distinct conjugate families with tunable binding characteristics have been designed to adjacently bind a particular RNA sequence. In the resulting ternary complex, their peptide elements are located in proximity, a feature that was used to enable an RNA-templated click reaction. The introduced structure-based design approach opens the door to novel functional biomolecular assemblies."

  "description": "A centrifugation-based clearing method allows high-throughput acidification and growth-rate measurements in milkThe turbidity of milk prohibits the use of optical density measurements for strain characterizations. This often limits research to laboratory media. Here, we cleared milk through centrifugation to remove insoluble milk solids. This resulted in a clear liquid phase, termed milk serum, in which optical density measurements can be used to track microbial growth until a pH of 5.2 is reached. At pH 5.2 coagulation of the soluble protein occurs, making the medium opaque again. We found that behavior in milk serum was predictive of that in milk for 39 Lactococcus lactis (R2 = 0.81) and to a lesser extent for 42 Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (formerly Lactobacillus plantarum; R2 = 0.49) strains. Hence, milk serum can be used as an optically clear alternative to milk for comparison of microbial growth and metabolic characteristics. Characterization of the growth rate, specific acidification rate for optical density at a wavelength of 600 nm, and the amount of acid produced per unit of biomass for all these strains in milk serum, showed that almost all strains could grow in milk, with higher specific acidification and growth rates of Lc. lactis strains compared with Lb. plantarum strains. Nondairy Lc. lactis isolates had a lower growth and specific acidification rate than dairy isolates. The amount of acid produced per unit biomass was relatively high and similar for Lc. lactis dairy and nondairy isolates, as opposed to Lb. plantarum isolates. Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis showed slightly lower growth and acidification rates when compared with ssp. cremoris. For Lc. lactis strains a doubling of the specific acidification rate occurred with a doubling of the maximum growth rate. This relation was not found for Lb. plantarum strains, where the acidification rate remained relatively constant across 39 strains with growth rates ranging from 0.2 h\u22121 to 0.3 h\u22121. We conclude that milk serum is a valuable alternative to milk for high-throughput strain characterization during milk fermentation."

  "description": "Characterisation of (anti-)progestogenic and (anti-)androgenic activities in surface and wastewater using high resolution effectdirected analysisThe quality of surface waters is threatened by pollution with low concentrations of bioactive chemicals, among which those interfering with steroid hormone systems. Induced by reports of anti-progestogenic activity in surface waters, a two-year four-weekly survey of (anti-)progestogenic activity was performed at three surface water locations in the Netherlands that serve as abstraction points for the production of drinking water. As certain endogenous and synthetic progestogenic compounds are also potent (anti-)androgens, these activities were also investigated. Anti-progestogenic and anti-androgenic activities were detected in the majority of the monitoring samples, sometimes in concentrations exceeding effect-based trigger values, indicating the need for further research. To characterize the compounds responsible for the activities, a high resolution Effect-Directed Analysis (hr-EDA) panel was combined with PR and AR CALUX bioassays, performed in agonistic and antagonistic modes. The influent and effluent of a domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) were included as effluent is a possible emission source of active compounds. As drivers for androgenic and progestogenic activities several native and synthetic steroid hormones were identified in the WWTP samples, namely androstenedione, testosterone, DHT, levonorgestrel and cyproterone acetate. The pesticides metolachlor and cyazofamid were identified as contributors to both the anti-progestogenic and anti-androgenic activities in surface water. In addition, epiconazole contributed to the anti-progestogenic activities in the rivers Rhine and Enclosed Meuse. This study showed the strength of hr-EDA for the identification of bioactive compounds in environmental samples and shed light on the drivers of (anti-)progestogenic and (anti-)androgenic activities in the aquatic environment."

We here report that CL activated detergent-solubilized cytochrome bd, a terminal oxidase from Escherichia coli. CL enhanced the oxygen consumption activity ~ twofold and decreased the apparent KM value for ubiquinol-1 as substrate from 95\u00b5M to 35\u00b5M. Activation by CL was also observed for cytochrome bd from two Gram-positive species, Geobacillus thermodenitrificans and Corynebacterium glutamicum, and for cytochrome bo3 from E. coli.

  "description": "Evaluation of chemicals of environmental concern in crumb rubber and water leachates from several types of synthetic turf football pitchesNowadays concern exists about the safety for both football players and the environment of recycled tire rubber used as infill in synthetic turf football pitches. In this study 40 target compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), plasticizers, antioxidants and vulcanization agents were determined in 50 synthetic football pitches of diverse characteristics to estimate environmental risks. This is the first study of crumb rubber sport facilities in Portugal. Analyses were performed by ultrasound-assisted extraction followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UAE-GC-MS/MS). To evaluate the transfer of the target chemicals from the crumb rubber to the runoff water, water leachates collected from several football pitches were analyzed by solid-phase microextraction (SPME-GC-MS/MS). In addition, lab-scale runoff simulation experiments were performed to assess whether a persistent inflow of the target compounds from the football pitches into the runoff water wcould exist. Results revealed the presence of most of the target PAHs in crumb rubber at total concentrations up to 57 \u03bcg g\u22121, next to a high number of plasticizers and vulcanization agents. Runoff water collected from the football pitches contained up to 13 PAHs as well as other chemicals of environmental concern. In addition, continuous leaching of chemicals from the crumb rubber to the surrounding water was demonstrated. The transfer of target chemicals into the runoff water poses a potential risk for the aquatic environment."

  "description": "Lysosome-targeted photodynamic treatment induces primary keratinocyte differentiationPhotodynamic therapy is an attractive technique for various skin tumors and non-cancerous skin lesions. However, while the aim of photodynamic therapy is to target and damage only the malignant cells, it unavoidably affects some of the healthy cells surrounding the tumor as well. However, data on the effects of PDT to normal cells are scarce, and the characterization of the pathways activated after the photodamage of normal cells may help to improve clinical photodynamic therapy. In our study, primary human epidermal keratinocytes were used to evaluate photodynamic treatment effects of photosensitizers with different subcellular localization. We compared the response of keratinocytes to lysosomal photodamage induced by phthalocyanines, aluminum phthalocyanine disulfonate (AlPcS2a) or aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AlPcS4), and cellular membrane photodamage by m-tetra(3-hydroxyphenyl)-chlorin (mTHPC). Our data showed that mTHPC-PDT promoted autophagic flux, whereas lysosomal photodamage induced by aluminum phthalocyanines evoked differentiation and apoptosis. Photodamage by AlPcS2a, which is targeted to lysosomal membranes, induced keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis more efficiently than AlPcS4, which is targeted to lysosomal lumen. Computational analysis of the interplay between these molecular pathways revealed that keratin 10 is the coordinating molecular hub of primary keratinocyte differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy."

  "description": "Bioactivation of trichloroethylene to three regioisomeric glutathione conjugates by liver fractions and recombinant human glutathione transferases: Species differences and implications for human risk assessmentEnzymatic conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to trichloroethylene (TCE) followed by catabolism to the corresponding cysteine-conjugate, S-(dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC), and subsequent bioactivation by renal cysteine conjugate beta-lyases is considered to play an important role in the nephrotoxic effects observed in TCE-exposed rat and human. In this study, it is shown for the first time that three regioisomers of GSH-conjugates of TCE are formed by rat and human liver fractions, namely S-(1,2-trans-dichlorovinyl)-glutathione (1,2-trans-DCVG), S-(1,2-cis-dichlorovinyl)-glutathione (1,2-cis-DCVG) and S-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-glutathione (2,2-DCVG). In incubations of TCE with rat liver fractions their amounts decreased in order of 1,2-cis-DCVG > 1,2-trans-DCVG > 2,2-DCVG. Human liver cytosol showed a more than 10-fold lower activity of GSH-conjugation, with amounts of regioisomers decreasing in order 2,2-DCVG > 1,2-trans-DCVG > 1,2-cis-DCVG. Incubations with recombinant human GSTs suggest that GSTA1-1 and GSTA2-2 play the most important role in human liver cytosol. GSTP1-1, which produces regioisomers in order 1,2-trans-DCVG > 2,2-cis-DCVG > 1,2-cis-DCVG, is likely to contribute to extrahepatic GSH-conjugation of TCE. Analysis of the products formed by a beta-lyase mimetic model showed that both 1,2-trans-DCVC and 1,2-cis-DCVC are converted to reactive products that form cross-links between the model nucleophile 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)-pyridine (NBP) and thiol-species. No NBP-alkylation was observed with 2,2-DCVC corresponding to its low cytotoxicity and mutagenicity. The lower activity of GSH-conjugation of TCE by human liver fractions, in combination with the lower fraction of potential nephrotoxic and mutagenic 1,2-DCVG-isomers, suggest that humans are at much lower risk for TCE-associated nephrotoxic effects than rats."

  "description": "IL-1R1-Dependent Signals Improve Control of Cytosolic Virulent Mycobacteria In VivoMycobacterium tuberculosis infections claim more than a million lives each year, and better treatments or vaccines are required. A crucial pathogenicity factor is translocation from phagolysosomes to the cytosol upon phagocytosis by macrophages. Translocation from the phagolysosome to the cytosol is an ESX-1-dependent process, as previously shown in vitro Here, we show that in vivo, mycobacteria also translocate to the cytosol but mainly when host immunity is compromised. We observed only low numbers of cytosolic bacilli in mice, armadillos, zebrafish, and patient material infected with M. tuberculosis, M. marinum, or M. leprae In contrast, when innate or adaptive immunity was compromised, as in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1)-deficient mice, significant numbers of cytosolic M. tuberculosis bacilli were detected in the lungs of infected mice. Taken together, in vivo, translocation to the cytosol of M. tuberculosis is controlled by adaptive immune responses as well as IL-1R1-mediated signals.IMPORTANCE For decades, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been one of the deadliest pathogens known. Despite infecting approximately one-third of the human population, no effective treatment or vaccine is available. A crucial pathogenicity factor is subcellular localization, as M. tuberculosis can translocate from phagolysosome to the cytosol in macrophages. The situation in vivo is more complicated. In this study, we establish that high-level cytosolic escape of mycobacteria can indeed occur in vivo but mainly when host resistance is compromised. The IL-1 pathway is crucial for the control of the number of cytosolic mycobacteria. The establishment that immune signals result in the clearance of cells containing cytosolic mycobacteria connects two important fields, cell biology and immunology, which is vital for the understanding of the pathology of M. tuberculosis."

Here, we extend our previously developed sequence-based predictors for homodimer and heterodimer PPI interfaces to predict epitope residues that have the potential to bind an antibody.RESULTS: We collected and curated a high quality epitope dataset from the SAbDab database. Our generic PPI heterodimer predictor obtained an AUC-ROC of 0.666 when evaluated on the epitope test set. We then trained a random forest model specifically on the epitope dataset, reaching AUC 0.694. Further training on the combined heterodimer and epitope datasets, improves our final predictor to AUC 0.703 on the epitope test set. This is better than the best state-of-the-art sequence-based epitope predictor BepiPred-2.0. On one solved antibody-antigen structure of the COVID19 virus spike RNA binding domain, our predictor reaches AUC 0.778. We added the SeRenDIP-CE Conformational Epitope predictors to our webserver, which is simple to use and only requires a single antigen sequence as input, which will help make the method immediately applicable in a wide range of biomedical and biomolecular research.AVAILABILITY: Webserver, source code and datasets at www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/serendipwww/."

  "description": "Exploring the Effect of Cyclization of Histamine H1Receptor Antagonists on Ligand Binding KineticsThere is an increasing interest in guiding hit optimization by considering the target binding kinetics of ligands. However, compared to conventional structure-activity relationships, structure-kinetics relationships have not been as thoroughly explored, even for well-studied archetypical drug targets such as the histamine H1 receptor (H1R), a member of the family A G-protein coupled receptor. In this study, we show that the binding kinetics of H1R antagonists at the H1R is dependent on the cyclicity of both the aromatic head group and the amine moiety of H1R ligands, the chemotypes that are characteristic for the first-generation H1R antagonists. Fusing the two aromatic rings of H1R ligands into one tricyclic aromatic head group prolongs the H1R residence time for benchmark H1R ligands as well as for tailored synthetic analogues. The effect of constraining the aromatic rings and the basic amines is systematically explored, leading to a coherent series and detailed discussions of structure-kinetics relationships. This study shows that cyclicity has a pronounced effect on the binding kinetics. "

  "description": "Noncovalent Interactions from Models for the M\u00f8ller-Plesset Adiabatic ConnectionGiven the omnipresence of noncovalent interactions (NCIs), their accurate simulations are of crucial importance across various scientific disciplines. Here we construct accurate models for the description of NCIs by an interpolation along the M\u00f8ller-Plesset adiabatic connection (MP AC). Our interpolation approximates the correlation energy, by recovering MP2 at small coupling strengths and the correct large-coupling strength expansion of the MP AC, recently shown to be a functional of the Hartree-Fock density. Our models are size consistent for fragments with nondegenerate ground states, have the same cost as double hybrids, and require no dispersion corrections to capture NCIs accurately. These interpolations greatly reduce large MP2 errors for typical \u03c0-stacking complexes (e.g., benzene-pyridine dimers) and for the L7 data set. They are also competitive with state-of-the-art dispersion enhanced functionals and can even significantly outperform them for a variety of data sets, such as CT7 and L7."

The protective cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria is a major permeability barrier that contributes to the problem by restricting the uptake of antibiotics. On the other hand, its unique architecture also makes it a suitable target for antibiotic interference. In particular, essential multiprotein machines that are required for biogenesis of the outer membrane have attracted attention in antibacterial design strategies. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of inhibitors of the \u03b2-barrel assembly machine (BAM) complex. Here, we summarize the current state of drug development efforts targeting the BAM complex in pursuit of new antibiotics."

  "description": "Different resource allocation in a bacillus subtilis population displaying bimodal motilityTo cope with sudden changes in their environment, bacteria can use a bet-hedging strategy by dividing the population into cells with different properties. This so-called bimodal or bistable cellular differentiation is generally controlled by positive feedback regulation of transcriptional activators. Due to the continuous increase in cell volume, it is difficult for these activators to reach an activation threshold concentration when cells are growing exponentially. This is one reason why bimodal differentiation is primarily observed from the onset of the stationary phase, when exponential growth ceases. An exception is the bimodal induction of motility in Bacillus subtilis, which occurs early during exponential growth. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain this, including double-negative feedback regulation and the stability of the mRNA molecules involved. In this study, we used fluorescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS) to compare the transcriptomes of motile and nonmotile cells and noted that expression of ribosomal genes is lower in motile cells. This was confirmed using an unstable green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter fused to the strong ribosomal rpsD promoter. We propose that the reduction in ribosomal gene expression in motile cells is the result of a diversion of cellular resources to the synthesis of the chemotaxis and motility systems. In agreement with this, single-cell microscopic analysis showed that motile cells are slightly shorter than nonmotile cells, an indication of slower growth. We speculate that this growth rate reduction can contribute to the bimodal induction of motility during exponential growth."

We determined the developmental toxicity profile of ultrapure PCB 180 in developing offspring following in utero and lactational exposure with the focus on endocrine, metabolic and retinoid system alterations. Pregnant rats were given total doses of 0, 10, 30, 100, 300 or 1000 mg PCB 180/kg bw on gestational days 7-10 by oral gavage, and the offspring were sampled on postnatal days (PND) 7, 35 and 84. Decreased serum testosterone and triiodothyronine concentrations on PND 84, altered liver retinoid levels, increased liver weights and induced 7-pentoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (PROD) activity were the sensitive effects used for margin of exposure (MoE) calculations. Liver weights were increased together with induction of the metabolizing enzymes cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B1, CYP3A1, and CYP1A1. Less sensitive effects included decreased serum estradiol and increased luteinizing hormone levels in females, decreased prostate and seminal vesicle weight and increased pituitary weight in males, increased cortical bone area and thickness of tibial diaphysis in females and decreased cortical bone mineral density in males. Developmental toxicity profiles were partly different in male and female offspring, males being more sensitive to increased liver weight, PROD induction and decreased thyroxine concentrations. MoE assessment indicated that the 95th percentile of current maternal PCB 180 concentrations do not exceed the estimated tolerable human lipid-based PCB 180 concentration. Although PCB 180 is much less potent than dioxin-like compounds, it shares several toxicological targets suggesting a potential for interactions."

Children provided two saliva samples at 11:30 on consecutive days at the end of the study. Analyses revealed that the probiotic group had lower cortisol than the placebo or diet-as-usual groups (p =.015); CRP levels were comparable across groups (p =.549). Exploratory analyses suggested that dose and regularity of consumption may impact the biomarkers as well. This study provides the first evidence that a probiotic milk product may lower cortisol in a sample of young, economically-disadvantaged children."

  "description": "FRET Analysis of RNA \u2013Protein Interactions Using Spinach AptamersThe method development to analyze direct RNA\u2013protein interaction is of high importance as not many homogeneous assay formats are available. The discovery of fluorescent light-up aptamers (FLAPs), short RNA aptamers that switch the fluorescence of small, cell-permeable, and nontoxic organic chromophores on, paved the road for their utilization in direct RNA\u2013protein interactions. The combination with fluorescent proteins as biological fluorophores enabled the development of homogeneous assays that are in principle even encodable on genomic level. Here the rules and methods to design a homogeneous in vitro assay for the detection and quantification of a direct RNA\u2013protein interaction will be described. The design and application of a homogeneous assay to observe and quantify the interaction of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage coat protein 7 (PP7) with its binding RNA sequence (pp7-RNA) will be shown. For this, the Spinach-DFHBI aptamer as RNA fusion and the red fluorescent mCherry as protein fusion was used. The methods presented here do not require any chemical modification of proteins or RNAs which make them relatively easy to use and to adopt on other systems. As all fluorophores are fusion tags to the according biomolecules, standard cloning strategies and molecular biology technologies are sufficient and make this method available for a broad community of researchers."

The current awareness that GPCR ligands may display bias toward G protein signaling or \u03b2-arrestin recruitment makes \u03b2-arrestin recruitment assays important additions to the drug discovery toolbox. This chapter describes two NanoLuc-based methods to monitor \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment to the human histamine H1 receptor by measuring bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and enzyme-fragment complementation in real-time on living cells with reasonable high throughput. In addition to the detection of agonism, both assay formats can be used to qualitatively evaluate the binding kinetics of antihistamines on the human histamine H1 receptor."

Using BBB cell assays makes it possible to investigate whether a compound is likely to compromise BBBs functionality, thereby probably resulting in neurotoxicity. Recently, several protocols to obtain human brain-like endothelial cells (BLECs) from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been reported. Within the framework of the European MSCA-ITN in3 project, we explored the possibility to use an iPSC-derived BBB model to assess the effects of repeated dose treatment with chemicals, using Cyclosporine A (CsA) as a model compound. The BLECs were found to exhibit important BBB characteristics up to 15 days after the end of the differentiation and could be used to assess the effects of repeated dose treatment. Although BLECs were still undergoing transcriptional changes over time, a targeted transcriptome analysis (TempO-Seq) indicated a time and concentration dependent activation of ATF4, XBP1, Nrf2 and p53 stress response pathways under CsA treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that this iPSC-derived BBB model and iPSC-derived models in general hold great potential to study the effects of repeated dose exposure with chemicals, allowing personalized and patient-specific studies in the future."

  "description": "Growth, dormancy and lysis: the complex relation of starter culture physiology and cheese flavour formationFast acidification and growth are desired from lactic acid bacteria starter cultures during food fermentation to minimise the risk of spoilage and process failure. In addition, starter cultures play a predominant role in the formation of flavour volatiles. Recent studies in different microbial species have shown that high growth rates come at the expense of the expression level of metabolic enzymes and/or stress proteins. In starter cultures, such a trade-off would affect flavour formation, which depends on the level of flavour-forming enzymes and the prolonged survival of cells. Moreover, starter culture performance during cheese ripening could also be influenced by its cultivation history due to the low number of divisions during cheese manufacturing and limited proteome adjustment during ripening. These findings indicate that changes in (pre)-culture conditions can modulate proteome allocation and metabolic stability in starter cultures, and thereby provide novel approaches to steer flavour formation."

  "description": "Limited lactosylation of beta-lactoglobulin from cow\u2019s milk exerts strong influence on antigenicity and degranulation of mast cellsBackground: beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) is one of the major cow\u2019s milk proteins and the most abundant allergen in whey. Heating is a common technologic treatment applied during milk transformational processes. Maillardation of BLG in the presence of reducing sugars and elevated temperatures may influence its antigenicity and allergenicity. Primary objective: to analyze and identify lactosylation sites by capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry (CE-MS). Secondary objective: to assess the effect of lactosylated BLG on antigenicity and degranulation of mast cells. Methods: BLG was lactosylated at pH 7, a water activity (aw) of 0.43, and a temperature of 65\u25e6C using a molar ratio BLG:lactose of 1:1 by incubating for 0, 3, 8, 16 or 24 h. For the determination of the effect on antibody-binding capacity of lactosylated BLG, an ELISA was performed. For the assessment of degranulation of the cell-line RBL-h\u03b5Ia-2B12 transfected with the human \u03b1-chain, Fc\u03b5 receptor type 1 (Fc\u03b5RI) was used. Results: BLG showed saturated lactosylation between 8 and 16 incubation hours in our experimental setup. Initial stage lactosylation sites L1 (N-terminus)\u2014K47, K60, K75, K77, K91, K138 and K141\u2014have been identified using CE-MS. Lactosylated BLG showed a significant reduction of both the IgG binding (p = 0.0001) as well as degranulation of anti-BLG IgE-sensitized RBL-h\u03b5Ia-2B12 cells (p < 0.0001). Conclusions and clinical relevance: this study shows that lactosylation of BLG decreases both the antigenicity and degranulation of mast cells and can therefore be a promising approach for reducing allergenicity of cow\u2019s milk allergens provided that the process is well-controlled."

  "description": "Model Selection Reveals the Butyrate-Producing Gut Bacterium Coprococcus eutactus as Predictor for Language Development in 3-Year-Old Rural Ugandan ChildrenIntroduction: The metabolic activity of the gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the gut-brain axis through the effects of bacterial metabolites on brain function and development. In this study we investigated the association of gut microbiota composition with language development of 3-year-old rural Ugandan children. Methods: We studied the language ability in 139 children of 36 months in our controlled maternal education intervention trial to stimulate children\u2019s growth and development. The dataset includes 1170 potential predictors, including anthropometric and cognitive parameters at 24 months, 542 composition parameters of the children\u2019s gut microbiota at 24 months and 621 of these parameters at 36 months. We applied a novel computationally efficient version of the all-subsets regression methodology and identified predictors of language ability of 36-months-old children scored according to the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III). Results: The best three-term model, selected from more than 266 million models, includes the predictors Coprococcus eutactus at 24 months of age, Bifidobacterium at 36 months of age, and language development at 24 months. The top 20 four-term models, selected from more than 77 billion models, consistently include C. eutactus abundance at 24 months, while 14 of these models include the other two predictors as well. Mann\u2013Whitney U tests suggest that the abundance of gut bacteria in language non-impaired children (n = 78) differs from that in language impaired children (n = 61). While anaerobic butyrate-producers, including C. eutactus, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Holdemanella biformis, Roseburia hominis are less abundant, facultative anaerobic bacteria, including Granulicatella elegans, Escherichia/Shigella and Campylobacter coli, are more abundant in language impaired children. The overall predominance of oxygen tolerant species in the gut microbiota was slightly higher in the language impaired group than in the non-impaired group (P = 0.09). Conclusion: Application of the all-subsets regression methodology to microbiota data established a correlation between the relative abundance of the anaerobic butyrate-producing gut bacterium C. eutactus and language development in Ugandan children. We propose that the gut redox potential and the overall bacterial butyrate-producing capacity in the gut are important factors for language development."

Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied for example, as inhibitors of protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs). Even though \u03b2-sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure-based design of \u03b2-sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein \u03b2-catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of \u03b2-catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with \u03b2-catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic \u03b2-sheet mimetics employing a late-stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to \u03b2-catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other \u03b2-sheet-mediated PPIs."

  "description": "A yeast FRET biosensor enlightens cAMP signalingThe cAMP-PKA signaling cascade in budding yeast regulates adaptation to changing environments. We developed yEPAC, a FRET-based biosensor for cAMP measurements in yeast. We used this sensor with flow cytometry for high-throughput single cell-level quantification during dynamic changes in response to sudden nutrient transitions. We found that the characteristic cAMP peak differentiates between different carbon source transitions and is rather homogenous among single cells, especially for transitions to glucose. The peaks are mediated by a combination of extracellular sensing and intracellular metabolism. Moreover, the cAMP peak follows the Weber-Fechner law; its height scales with the relative, and not the absolute, change in glucose. Last, our results suggest that the cAMP peak height conveys information about prospective growth rates. In conclusion, our yEPAC-sensor makes possible new avenues for understanding yeast physiology, signaling, and metabolic adaptation."

  "description": "Developmental neurotoxicity of environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals and mixtures thereof in a zebrafish embryo behavioural testHumans are exposed daily to complex mixtures of chemical substances via food intake, inhalation, and dermal contact. Developmental neurotoxicity is an understudied area and entails one of the most complex areas in toxicology. Animal studies for developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) are hardly performed in the context of regular hazard studies, as they are costly and time consuming and provide only limited information as to human relevance. There is a need for a combination of in vitro and in silico tests for the assessment of chemically induced DNT in humans. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo (ZFE) provides a powerful model to study DNT because it shows fast neurodevelopment with a large resemblance to the higher vertebrate, including the human system. One of the suitable readouts for DNT testing in the zebrafish is neurobehaviour (stimulus-provoked locomotion) since this provides integrated information on the functionality and status of the entire nervous system of the embryo. In the current study, environmentally relevant pharmaceuticals and their mixtures were investigated using the zebrafish light-dark transition test. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to three neuroactive compounds of concern, carbamazepine (CBZ), fluoxetine (FLX), and venlafaxine (VNX), as well as their main metabolites, carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide (CBZ 10,11E), norfluoxetine (norFLX), and desvenlafaxine (desVNX). All the studied compounds, except CBZ 10,11E, dose-dependently inhibited zebrafish locomotor activity, providing a distinct behavioural phenotype. Mixture experiments with these pharmaceuticals identified that dose addition was confirmed for all the studied binary mixtures (CBZ-FLX, CBZ-VNX, and VNX-FLX), thereby supporting the zebrafish embryo as a model for studying the cumulative effect of chemical mixtures in DNT. This study shows that pharmaceuticals and a mixture thereof affect locomotor activity in zebrafish. The test is directly applicable in environmental risk assessment; however, further studies are required to assess the relevance of these findings for developmental neurotoxicity in humans."

This study aims to illuminate the detailed components of managing service innovations at OTAs.Design/methodology/approachAn in-depth case study is conducted at Trip, the largest OTA in China. A coherent framework of managing service innovations at OTAs is proposed through refining an existing framework from new service development (NSD), and concerning the success factors of service innovation. Based on theoretical synthesis and empirical analysis, the NSD framework is adapted, restructured and refined for service innovation management at OTAs.FindingsThe proposed framework contains three facets and associated managerial elements: (1) resources, including stakeholders, technologies and systems; (2) contexts, including innovation strategy, structure and culture; and (3) ideation, including idea generation and idea application. Different success factors are attached to the managerial elements. The facets, managerial elements and success factors serve as the components in the framework.Research limitations/implicationsThis study provides academia with an analytical framework to understand and interpret service innovation management at OTAs, which can be used as a point of departure for future research.Practical implicationsThe analytical framework inspires OTA managers to adopt a structured approach in service innovation management, and policymakers to design related interventions.Originality/valueThis study offers a first step toward the investigation of service innovation management at OTAs, specifically in China. The proposed framework is potentially applicable to other industries.[With also Chinese summary, see DOI.]"

  "description": "Origin of the \u03b1-Effect in SN2 ReactionsThe \u03b1-effect is a term used to explain the dramatically enhanced reactivity of \u03b1-nucleophiles (R\u2212Y\u2212X:\u2212) compared to their parent normal nucleophile (R\u2212X:\u2212) by deviating from the classical Br\u00f8nsted-type reactivity-basicity relationship. The exact origin of this effect is, however, still heavily under debate. In this work, we have quantum chemically analyzed the \u03b1-effect of a set of anionic nucleophiles, including O-, N- and S-based normal and \u03b1-nucleophiles, participating in an SN2 reaction with ethyl chloride using relativistic density functional theory at ZORA-OLYP/QZ4P. Our activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analyses identified two criteria an \u03b1-nucleophile needs to fulfill in order to show \u03b1-effect: (i) a small HOMO lobe on the nucleophilic center, pointing towards the substrate, to reduce the repulsive occupied\u2013occupied orbital overlap and hence (steric) Pauli repulsion with the substrate; and (ii) a sufficiently high energy HOMO to overcome the loss of favorable HOMO\u2013LUMO orbital overlap with the substrate, as a consequence of the first criterion, by reducing the HOMO\u2013LUMO orbital energy gap. If one of these two criteria is not fulfilled, one can expect no \u03b1-effect or inverse \u03b1-effect."

  "description": "Association of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants and children's behavior at a median age of 18 monthsExposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants (FRs) could have adverse effects on neurodevelopment in children. Some organophosphate (OPFRs) are used as alternatives for the phased-out decabromodiphenylether such as resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate (PBDPP) and bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate (BPA-BDPP). This study aims to investigate the relationship between indoor OPFR exposure and neurodevelopmental behavior in children. OPFRs were measured in house dust and hand wipes from 42 children, aged 8-16 months, from the LInking maternal Nutrition to Child health (LINC) study. At the median age of 18 months, the children's behavior was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, using three composite behavior scales: externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and total problems. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for maternal education and smoking by the partner. Children with higher BPA-BDPP, PBDPP, and tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) house dust concentrations were found to have higher scores on the behavioral problems scales. A 10-fold increase in BPA-BDPP and PBDPP concentration was associated with a 4.1 and 2.6 point increase on the internalizing problems scale (respectively p=0.004 and p=0.042). Increased BPA-BDPP concentrations were associated with elevated scores on the externalizing problems scale and total behavioral problems scale (respectively 7.6 and 16 points increase per 10-fold BPA-BDPP concentration increase, p=0.015 and p=0.007). TCEP dust concentrations were associated with the externalizing problems scale (13 point increase per 10-fold TCEP concentration increase, p=0.043). This study showed the importance of investigating the health effects of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants. Further research on neurodevelopmental health effects of OPFR exposure is warranted."

  "description": "SARS-CoV-2 infects an upper airway model derived from induced pluripotent stem cellsAs one of the primary points of entry of xenobiotic substances and infectious agents into the body, the lungs are subject to a range of dysfunctions and diseases that together account for a significant number of patient deaths. In view of this, there is an outstanding need for in vitro systems in which to assess the impact of both infectious agents and xenobiotic substances of the lungs. To address this issue, we have developed a protocol to generate airway epithelial basal-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells, which simplifies the manufacture of cellular models of the human upper airways. Basal-like cells generated in this study were cultured on transwell inserts to allow formation of a confluent monolayer and then exposed to an air-liquid interface to induce differentiation into a pseudostratified epithelial construct with a marked similarity to the upper airway epithelium in vivo. These constructs contain the component cell types required of an epithelial model system, produce mucus and functional cilia, and can support SARS-CoV-2 infection/replication and the secretion of cytokines in a manner similar to that of in vivo airways. This method offers a readily accessible and highly scalable protocol for the manufacture of upper airway models that could find applications in development of therapies for respiratory viral infections and the assessment of drug toxicity on the human lungs."

  "description": "A review of bottom-up and top-down emission estimates of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in different parts of the worldHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are widespread alternatives for the ozone-depleting substances chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. They are used mainly as refrigerants or as foam-blowing agents. HFCs do not deplete the ozone layer, but they are very potent greenhouse gases, already contributing to global warming. Since 2019 HFCs are regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which demands reliable emission estimates to monitor the phase-down. Quantification of emissions is performed with two methods: bottom-up from product inventories or data on chemical sales; or top-down, inferred from atmospheric measurements by inverse modelling or interspecies correlation. Here, we review and compare the two methods and give an overview of HFC emissions from different parts of the world. Emission estimates reported by the different methods vary considerably. HFC emissions of developed countries (Annex I) are reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These bottom-up estimates add up to only half of global emissions estimated from atmospheric data. Several studies with regional top-down estimates have shown that this gap is not owed to large-scale underreporting of emissions from developed countries, but mostly due to emissions from developing countries (non-Annex I). China accounts for a large fraction of the emissions causing the gap, but not entirely. Bottom-up and top-down estimations of emissions from other developing countries that could identify other large emitters are largely unavailable. Especially South America, West-, Central- and East-Africa, India, the Arabian Peninsula and Northern Australia are not well covered by measurement stations that could provide atmospheric data for top-down estimates."

To better understand these processes, it would be advantageous to generate renal tissues from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Here, we report the differentiation and characterization of iPSC lines into proximal tubular-like cells (PTL). The protocol is a step wise exposure of small molecules and growth factors, including the GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), the retinoic acid receptor activator (TTNPB), FGF9 and EGF, to drive iPSC to PTL via cell stages representing characteristics of early stages of renal development. Genome-wide RNA sequencing showed that PTL clustered within a kidney phenotype. PTL expressed proximal tubular-specific markers, including megalin (LRP2), showed a polarized phenotype, and were responsive to parathyroid hormone. PTL could take up albumin and exhibited ABCB1 transport activity. The phenotype was stable for up to 7days and was maintained after passaging. This protocol will form the basis of an optimized strategy for molecular investigations using iPSC derived PTL."

  "description": "Stimulated Raman scattering simulation for imaging optimizationTwo simulation programs of a stimulated Raman scattering microscopy (SRS) imaging system with lock-in amplifier (LIA) detection were developed. SRS is an imaging technique based on the vibrational Raman cross-section as the contrast mechanism and enables fast, label-free imaging. Most SRS implementations are based on LIA detection of a modulated signal. However, building and operating such SRS set-ups still poses a challenge when selecting the LIA parameter settings for optimized acquisition speed or image quality. Moreover, the type of sample, e.g. a sparse sample vs. a densely packed sample, the required resolution as well as the Raman cross-section and the laser powers affect the parameter choice.A simulation program was used to find these optimal parameters. The focal spot diameters of the individual lasers (pump and Stokes) were used to estimate the effective SRS signal focal spot and the (optical) spatial resolution. By calibrating the signal and noise propagation through an SRS system for a known molecule, we estimated the signal and noise input to the LIA. We used a low pass filter model to simulate the LIA behavior in order to find the optimal parameters (i.e. filter order and time constant).Optimization was done for either image quality (expressed as contrast to noise ratio) or acquisition time. The targeted object size was first determined as a measure for the required resolution. The simulation output consisted of the LIA parameters, pixel dwell time and contrast to noise ratio.In a second simulation we evaluated SRS imaging based on the same principles as the optimal setting simulation, i.e. the signals were propagated through an imaging system and LIA detection. The simulated images were compared to experimental SRS images of polystyrene beads.Finally, the same software was used to simulate multiplexed SRS imaging. In this study we modeled a six-channel frequency-encoded multiplexed SRS system demodulated with six LIA channels. We evaluated the inter-channel crosstalk as a function of chosen LIA parameters, which in multiplex SRS imaging also needs to be considered.These programs to optimize the contrast to noise ratio, acquisition speed, resolution and crosstalk will be useful for operating stimulated Raman scattering imaging setup, as well as for designing novel setups."

  "description": "Seasonal Changes in Hemolymph Parameters of the Bivalve Modiolus kurilensis Bernard, 1983 from Vostok Bay, Sea of JapanAbstract: Hemolymph is one of the main tissues providing invertebrates\u2019 immunity and homeostasis. Earlier, we showed that some of the hemolymph immune parameters of the common Far Eastern mollusk Modiolus kurilensis are sensitive to bacterial and anthropogenic challenges. In this work, a number of cellular parameters such as total hemocyte count (THC), hemocyte phagocytic activity (PA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and humoral parameters such as hemagglutination (HA) and hemolytic (HL) activity of plasma, as well as its protein concentration (CP) and profiling in M. kurilensis were studied depending on the season and environmental indicators (temperature, salinity, and oxygen concentration). The total hemocyte count was weakly correlated with water oxygen concentration (R = \u20130.25) and temperature (R = 0.27), and the 36 kDa plasma protein was weakly correlated with temperature (R = \u20130.33). Also, there was a correlation (R = 0.38) between hemagglutination activity and the 19 kDa protein fraction. The minimum values for a number of parameters were noted in January (THC, PA, ROS, HA, HL), while the maximum values were observed in late spring (THC, PA, ROS, HA, HL). At the same time, in other months, these and most other parameters had metastable values. Thus, the indicators that were identified in previous studies (THC, PA, ROS, HA, HL, CP, protein fractions 55 and 124 kDa) are suitable for assessing the physiological state of M. kurilensis during most of the year."

  "description": "Constructing strings avoiding forbidden substringsWe consider the problem of constructing strings over an alphabet \u03a3 that start with a given prefix u, end with a given suffix v, and avoid occurrences of a given set of forbidden substrings. In the decision version of the problem, given a set Sk of forbidden substrings, each of length k, over \u03a3, we are asked to decide whether there exists a string x over \u03a3 such that u is a prefix of x, v is a suffix of x, and no s \u03f5 Sk occurs in x. Our first result is an O(|u| + |v| + k|Sk|)-time algorithm to decide this problem. In the more general optimization version of the problem, given a set S of forbidden arbitrary-length substrings over \u03a3, we are asked to construct a shortest string x over S such that u is a prefix of x, v is a suffix of x, and no s \u03f5 S occurs in x. Our second result is an O(|u| + |v| + ||S|| \u00b7 |\u03a3|)-time algorithm to solve this problem, where ||S|| denotes the total length of the elements of S. Interestingly, our results can be directly applied to solve the reachability and shortest path problems in complete de Bruijn graphs in the presence of forbidden edges or of forbidden paths. Our algorithms are motivated by data privacy, and in particular, by the data sanitization process. In the context of strings, sanitization consists in hiding forbidden substrings from a given string by introducing the least amount of spurious information. We consider the following problem. Given a string w of length n over \u03a3, an integer k, and a set Sk of forbidden substrings, each of length k, over \u03a3, construct a shortest string y over \u03a3 such that no s \u03f5 Sk occurs in y and the sequence of all other length-k fragments occurring in w is a subsequence of the sequence of the length-k fragments occurring in y. Our third result is an O(nk|Sk| \u00b7 |\u03a3|)-time algorithm to solve this problem."

  "description": "String sanitization under edit distance: Improved and generalizedLet W be a string of length n over an alphabet S, k be a positive integer, and S be a set of length-k substrings of W. The ETFS problem (Edit distance, Total order, Frequency, Sanitization) asks us to construct a string XEDsuch that: (i) no string of S occurs in XED; (ii) the order of all other length-k substrings over \u03a3 (and thus the frequency) is the same in W and in XED; and (iii) XEDhas minimal edit distance to W. When W represents an individual's data and S represents a set of confidential patterns, the ETFS problem asks for transforming W to preserve its privacy and its utility [Bernardini et al., ECML PKDD 2019]. ETFS can be solved in O(n2k) time [Bernardini et al., CPM 2020]. The same paper shows that ETFS cannot be solved in O(n2-\u03b4) time, for any \u03b4 > 0, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is false. Our main results can be summarized as follows: An O(n2log2k)-time algorithm to solve ETFS. An O(n2log2n)-time algorithm to solve AETFS (Arbitrary lengths, Edit distance, Total order, Frequency, Sanitization), a generalization of ETFS in which the elements of S can have arbitrary lengths. Our algorithms are thus optimal up to subpolynomial factors, unless SETH fails. In order to arrive at these results, we develop new techniques for computing a variant of the standard dynamic programming (DP) table for edit distance. In particular, we simulate the DP table computation using a directed acyclic graph in which every node is assigned to a smaller DP table. We then focus on redundancy in these DP tables and exploit a tabulation technique according to dyadic intervals to obtain an optimal alignment in O(n2) total time1. Beyond string sanitization, our techniques may inspire solutions to other problems related to regular expressions or context-free grammars."

  "description": "PPE38-Secretion-Dependent Proteins of M. tuberculosis Alter NF-kB Signalling and Inflammatory Responses in MacrophagesIt was previously shown that secretion of PE-PGRS and PPE-MPTR proteins is abolished in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates with a deletion in the ppe38-71 operon, which is associated with increased virulence. Here we investigate the proteins dependent on PPE38 for their secretion and their role in the innate immune response using temporal proteomics and protein turnover analysis in a macrophage infection model. A decreased pro-inflammatory response was observed in macrophages infected with PPE38-deficient M. tuberculosis CDC1551 as compared to wild type bacteria. We could show that dampening of the pro-inflammatory response is associated with activation of a RelB/p50 pathway, while the canonical inflammatory pathway is active during infection with wild type M. tuberculosis CDC1551. These results indicate a molecular mechanism by which M. tuberculosis PE/PPE proteins controlled by PPE38 have an effect on modulating macrophage responses through NF-kB signalling."

However, reactivation of latent HCMV in immunosuppressed solid organ and stem cell transplant patients often results in morbidity. Here, we report the killing of latently infected cells via a virus-specific nanobody (VUN100bv) that partially inhibits signaling of the viral receptor US28. VUN100bv reactivates immediate early gene expression in latently infected cells without inducing virus production. This allows recognition and killing of latently infected monocytes by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes from HCMV-seropositive individuals, which could serve as a therapy to reduce the HCMV latent reservoir of transplant patients."

  "description": "Uncovering the effects of heterogeneity and parameter sensitivity on within-host dynamics of disease: malaria as a case studyBackground: The fidelity and reliability of disease model predictions depend on accurate and precise descriptions of processes and determination of parameters. Various models exist to describe within-host dynamics during malaria infection but there is a shortage of clinical data that can be used to quantitatively validate them and establish confidence in their predictions. In addition, model parameters often contain a degree of uncertainty and show variations between individuals, potentially undermining the reliability of model predictions. In this study models were reproduced and analysed by means of robustness, uncertainty, local sensitivity and local sensitivity robustness analysis to establish confidence in their predictions.Results: Components of the immune system are responsible for the most uncertainty in model outputs, while disease associated variables showed the greatest sensitivity for these components. All models showed a comparable degree of robustness but displayed different ranges in their predictions. In these different ranges, sensitivities were well-preserved in three of the four models.Conclusion: Analyses of the effects of parameter variations in models can provide a comparative tool for the evaluation of model predictions. In addition, it can assist in uncovering model weak points and, in the case of disease models, be used to identify possible points for therapeutic intervention."

  "description": "Torpor enhances synaptic strength and restores memory performance in a mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s diseaseHibernation induces neurodegeneration-like changes in the brain, which are completely reversed upon arousal. Hibernation-induced plasticity may therefore be of great relevance for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, but remains largely unexplored. Here we show that a single torpor and arousal sequence in mice does not induce dendrite retraction and synapse loss as observed in seasonal hibernators. Instead, it increases hippocampal long-term potentiation and contextual fear memory. This is accompanied by increased levels of key postsynaptic proteins and mitochondrial complex I and IV proteins, indicating mitochondrial reactivation and enhanced synaptic plasticity upon arousal. Interestingly, a single torpor and arousal sequence was also sufficient to restore contextual fear memory in an APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Our study demonstrates that torpor in mice evokes an exceptional state of hippocampal plasticity and that naturally occurring plasticity mechanisms during torpor provide an opportunity to identify unique druggable targets for the treatment of cognitive impairment."

  "description": "GW100: A Slater-Type Orbital PerspectiveWe calculate complete basis set (CBS) limit-extrapolated ionization potentials (IPs) and electron affinities (EA) with Slater-type basis sets for the molecules in the GW100 database. To this end, we present two new Slater-type orbital (STO) basis sets of triple-(TZ) and quadruple-\u03b6 (QZ) quality, whose polarization is adequate for correlated-electron methods and which contain extra diffuse functions to be able to correctly calculate EAs of molecules with a positive lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). We demonstrate that going from TZ to QZ quality consistently reduces the basis set error of our computed IPs and EAs, and we conclude that a good estimate of these quantities at the CBS limit can be obtained by extrapolation. With mean absolute deviations (MAD) from 70 to 85 meV, our CBS limit-extrapolated IP are in good agreement with results from FHI-AIMS, TURBOMOLE, VASP, and WEST, while they differ by more than 130 meV on average from nanoGW. With a MAD of 160 meV, our EA are also in good agreement with the WEST code. Especially for systems with positive LUMOs, the agreement is excellent. With respect to other codes, the STO-type basis sets generally underestimate EAs of small molecules with strongly bound LUMOs. With 62 meV for IPs and 93 meV for EAs, we find much better agreement with CBS limit-extrapolated results from FHI-AIMS for a set of 250 medium to large organic molecules."

The computed half-lives of the meta-stable LB compounds vary between minutes to nanoseconds at cryogenic conditions. Accordingly, we predict that the long bond structures are practically impossible to isolate or characterize, which agrees with previous matrix-isolation experiments."

  "description": "Efficient workflow for the investigation of the catalytic cycle of water oxidation catalysts: Combining GFN-xTB and density functional theoryPhotocatalytic water oxidation remains the bottleneck in many artificial photosynthesis devices. The efficiency of this challenging process is inherently linked to the thermodynamic and electronic properties of the chromophore and the water oxidation catalyst (WOC). Computational investigations can facilitate the search for favorable chromophore-catalyst combinations. However, this remains a demanding task due to the requirements on the computational method that should be able to correctly describe different spin and oxidation states of the transition metal, the influence of solvation and the different rates of the charge transfer and water oxidation processes. To determine a suitable method with favorable cost/accuracy ratios, the full catalytic cycle of a molecular ruthenium based WOC is investigated using different computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT) with different functionals (GGA, Hybrid, Double Hybrid) as well as the semi-empirical tight binding approach GFN-xTB. A workflow with low computational cost is proposed that combines GFN-xTB and DFT and provides reliable results. GFN-xTB geometries and frequencies combined with single-point DFT energies give free energy changes along the catalytic cycle that closely follow the full DFT results and show satisfactory agreement with experiment, while significantly decreasing the computational cost. This workflow allows for cost efficient determination of energetic, thermodynamic and dynamic properties of WOCs."

  "description": "Cross platform solutions to improve the zebrafish polar metabolome coverage using LC-QTOF MS: Optimization of separation mechanisms, solvent additives, and resuspension solventsUntargeted metabolomics has been widely used for studies with zebrafish embryos. Until now, the number of analytical approaches to determine metabolites in zebrafish is limited, and there is a lack of consensus on the best platforms for comprehensive metabolomics analysis of zebrafish embryos. In addition, the capacity of these methods to detect metabolites is unsatisfactory and the confidence level for identifying compounds is relatively low. To improve the metabolome coverage, we mainly focused on the optimization of separation mechanisms, mobile phase additives, and resuspension solvents based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupling to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) techniques. Moreover, the procedures for optimizing methods were assessed when taking metabolite profiles in both positive and negative ionization modes into account. Four LC columns were studied: C18, T3, PFP, and HILIC. In positive ionization mode, it was strongly recommended to employ the HILIC approach operated at the neutral condition, which led to the presence of more than 4700 features and the annotation of 151 metabolites, mainly zwitterionic and basic compounds, in comparison to reverse phase (RP)-based methods with less than 1000 features. In negative ionization mode, the PFP column operated at 0.02% acetic acid showed the best performance in terms of metabolite coverage: 3100 metabolic features were detected and 218 metabolites were annotated in zebrafish embryos. Metabolite profiles mainly contained acidic and zwitterionic compounds. HILIC-based platforms were complementary to RP columns when analyzing highly polar metabolites. Additionally, it was preferable to reconstitute zebrafish extracts in 100% water for analysis of metabolites on RP columns, with a 20\u201330% increase in the number of identified metabolites compared to a 50% water in methanol solution. However, water/methanol (1:9, v/v), as resuspension solution, was advantageous over water/methanol (1:1, v/v) for HILIC analysis showing an 8\u201315% increase in detected metabolites. In total 336 polar metabolites were annotated by the combination of the optimized HILIC (positive) and PFP (negative) approaches. The largest metabolome coverage of polar metabolites in zebrafish embryos was obtained when three approaches were combined (negative PFP and HILIC, and HILIC positive) resulting in more than 420 annotated compounds."

  "description": "Nonadditivity in public and inhouse data: implications for drug designNumerous ligand-based drug discovery projects are based on structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, such as Free-Wilson (FW) or matched molecular pair (MMP) analysis. Intrinsically they assume linearity and additivity of substituent contributions. These techniques are challenged by nonadditivity (NA) in protein\u2013ligand binding where the change of two functional groups in one molecule results in much higher or lower activity than expected from the respective single changes. Identifying nonlinear cases and possible underlying explanations is crucial for a drug design project since it might influence which lead to follow. By systematically analyzing all AstraZeneca (AZ) inhouse compound data and publicly available ChEMBL25 bioactivity data, we show significant NA events in almost every second assay among the inhouse and once in every third assay in public data sets. Furthermore, 9.4% of all compounds of the AZ database and 5.1% from public sources display significant additivity shifts indicating important SAR features or fundamental measurement errors. Using NA data in combination with machine learning showed that nonadditive data is challenging to predict and even the addition of nonadditive data into training did not result in an increase in predictivity. Overall, NA analysis should be applied on a regular basis in many areas of computational chemistry and can further improve rational drug design."

  "description": "Bioenergetics theory and components | Periplasmic electron-transport systems in bacteriaThe periplasmic compartment lies between the inner (cytoplasmic) and outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria. It is frequently termed the \u2018periplasmic space\u2019, but this is a misnomer as the term \u2018space\u2019 suggests a void and the periplasmic compartment is far from that. In fact, it is a highly metabolically active compartment where many important respiratory electron-transfer proteins are located. In bacteria these periplasmic redox proteins result in a great respiratory diversity, as they can facilitate electron transfer between a range of electron donors (e.g., formate, hydrogen, reduced nitrogen species, and reduced sulfur species) and electron acceptors (e.g., nitrogen and sulfur oxyanions, dimethylsulfoxide, and trimethylamine N oxide). This underlies the success of bacteria in colonizing a wide range of the Earth\u05f3s oxic and anoxic environments and the important contribution of bacteria to critical biogeochemical element cycles, such as the nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon cycles."

G-quadruplex (G4)/hemin DNAzymes are of particular interest owing to their structural programmability and chemical robustness. However, optimized catalytic efficiency is still bottleneck and the activation mechanism is unclear. Herein, we have designed a series of parallel G4s with different proximal cytosine (dC) derivatives to fine-tune the hemin-binding pocket for G4-DNAzymes. Combining theoretical and experimental methods, we have assessed the dependence of catalytic enhancement on the electronic properties of proximal dCs and demonstrated how proximal dCs activate catalytic proficiency. These results provide interesting clues in recapitulating the push\u2013pull mechanism as the basis of peroxidase activity and help to devise a new strategy to design highly competent DNA catalysts whose performances are of the same order as protease."

  "description": "Bistability in fatty-acid oxidation resulting from substrate inhibitionIn this study we demonstrated through analytic considerations and numerical studies that the mitochondrial fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation can exhibit bistable-hysteresis behavior. In an experimentally validated computational model we identified a specific region in the parameter space in which two distinct stable and one unstable steady state could be attained with different fluxes. The two stable states were referred to as low-flux (disease) and high-flux (healthy) state. By a modular kinetic approach we traced the origin and causes of the bistability back to the distributive kinetics and the conservation of CoA, in particular in the last rounds of the \u03b2-oxidation. We then extended the model to investigate various interventions that may confer health benefits by activating the pathway, including (i) activation of the last enzyme MCKAT via its endogenous regulator p46-SHC protein, (ii) addition of a thioesterase (an acyl-CoA hydrolysing enzyme) as a safety valve, and (iii) concomitant activation of a number of upstream and downstream enzymes by short-chain fatty-acids (SCFA), metabolites that are produced from nutritional fibers in the gut. A high concentration of SCFAs, thioesterase activity, and inhibition of the p46Shc protein led to a disappearance of the bistability, leaving only the high-flux state. A better understanding of the switch behavior of the mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation process between a low- and a high-flux state may lead to dietary and pharmacological intervention in the treatment or prevention of obesity and or non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease."

Also, we compared DNA extraction kits from Qiagen and Zymo-Research. The types of samples were defined strains, both as single species and mixtures, as well as undefined indigenous microbial communities from soil. We show that the use of a preservation solution resulted in substantial changes in the 16S rRNA gene profiles either due to an overrepresentation of Gram-positive bacteria or to an underrepresentation of Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, 16S rRNA gene profiles were substantially different depending on the type of kit that was used for extraction. The kit from Zymo extracted DNA from different types of bacteria in roughly equal amounts. In contrast, the kit from Qiagen preferentially extracted DNA from Gram-negative bacteria while DNA from Gram-positive bacteria was extracted less effectively. These differences in kit performance strongly influenced the interpretation of our microbial ecology studies."

The computed activation energy systematically decreases as the basic sites of the diene progressively become protonated. Our activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses traced the origin of this enhanced reactivity to i) \u201cPauli-lowering catalysis\u201d for mono-protonated 2-aza-dienes due to the induction of an asynchronous, but still concerted, reaction pathway that reduces the Pauli repulsion between the reactants; and ii) \u201cLUMO-lowering catalysis\u201d for multi-protonated 2-aza-dienes due to their highly stabilized LUMO(s) and more concerted synchronous reaction path that facilitates more efficient orbital overlaps in IED interactions. In all, we illustrate how the novel concept of \u201cPauli-lowering catalysis\u201d can be overruled by the traditional concept of \u201cLUMO-lowering catalysis\u201d when the degree of LUMO stabilization is extreme as in the case of multi-protonated 2-aza-dienes."

  "description": "Using functional annotations to study pairwise interactions in urinary tract infection communitiesThe behaviour of microbial communities depends on environmental factors and on the interactions of the community members. This is also the case for urinary tract infection (UTI) microbial communities. Here, we devise a computational approach that uses indices of complementarity and competition based on metabolic gene annotation to rapidly predict putative interactions between pair of organisms with the aim to explain pairwise growth effects. We apply our method to 66 genomes selected from online databases, which belong to 6 genera representing members of UTI communities. This resulted in a selection of metabolic pathways with high correlation for each pairwise combination between a complementarity index and the experimentally derived growth data. Our results indicated that Enteroccus spp. were most complemented in its metabolism by the other members of the UTI community. This suggests that the growth of Enteroccus spp. can potentially be enhanced by complementary metabolites produced by other community members. We tested a few putative predicted interactions by experimental supplementation of the relevant predicted metabolites. As predicted by our method, folic acid supplementation led to the increase in the population density of UTI Enterococcus isolates. Overall, we believe our method is a rapid initial in silico screening for the prediction of metabolic interactions in microbial communities."

  "description": "Bidirectional string anchors: A new string sampling mechanismThe minimizers sampling mechanism is a popular mechanism for string sampling introduced independently by Schleimer et al. [SIGMOD 2003] and by Roberts et al. [Bioinf. 2004]. Given two positive integers w and k, it selects the lexicographically smallest length-k substring in every fragment of w consecutive length-k substrings (in every sliding window of length w + k \u2212 1). Minimizers samples are approximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. Although they do not have good worst-case guarantees on their size, they are often small in practice. They thus have been successfully employed in several string processing applications. Two main disadvantages of minimizers sampling mechanisms are: first, they also do not have good guarantees on the expected size of their samples for every combination of w and k; and, second, indexes that are constructed over their samples do not have good worst-case guarantees for on-line pattern searches. To alleviate these disadvantages, we introduce bidirectional string anchors (bd-anchors), a new string sampling mechanism. Given a positive integer \u2113, our mechanism selects the lexicographically smallest rotation in every length-\u2113 fragment (in every sliding window of length \u2113). We show that bd-anchors samples are also approximately uniform, locally consistent, and computable in linear time. In addition, our experiments using several datasets demonstrate that the bd-anchors sample sizes decrease proportionally to \u2113; and that these sizes are competitive to or smaller than the minimizers sample sizes using the analogous sampling parameters. We provide theoretical justification for these results by analyzing the expected size of bd-anchors samples. We also show that by using any bd-anchors sample, we can construct, in near-linear time, an index which requires linear (extra) space in the size of the sample and answers on-line pattern searches in near-optimal time. We further show, using several datasets, that a simple implementation of our index is consistently faster for on-line pattern searches than an analogous implementation of a minimizers-based index [Grabowski and Raniszewski, Softw. Pract. Exp. 2017]. Finally, we highlight the applicability of bd-anchors by developing an efficient and effective heuristic for top-K similarity search under edit distance. We show, using synthetic datasets, that our heuristic is more accurate and more than one order of magnitude faster in top-K similarity searches than the state-of-the-art tool for the same purpose [Zhang and Zhang, KDD 2020]."

  "description": "Faster algorithms for longest common substringIn the classic longest common substring (LCS) problem, we are given two strings S and T, each of length at most n, over an alphabet of size \u03c3, and we are asked to find a longest string occurring as a fragment of both S and T. Weiner, in his seminal paper that introduced the suffix tree, presented an O(nlog \u03c3)-time algorithm for this problem [SWAT 1973]. For polynomially-bounded integer alphabets, the linear-time construction of suffix trees by Farach yielded an O(n)-time algorithm for the LCS problem [FOCS 1997]. However, for small alphabets, this is not necessarily optimal for the LCS problem in the word RAM model of computation, in which the strings can be stored in O(nlog \u03c3/log n) space and read in O(nlog \u03c3/log n) time. We show that, in this model, we can compute an LCS in time O(nlog \u03c3/\u221alog n), which is sublinear in n if \u03c3 = 2o(\u221alog n) (in particular, if \u03c3 = O(1)), using optimal space O(nlog \u03c3/log n). We then lift our ideas to the problem of computing a k-mismatch LCS, which has received considerable attention in recent years. In this problem, the aim is to compute a longest substring of S that occurs in T with at most k mismatches. Flouri et al. showed how to compute a 1-mismatch LCS in O(nlog n) time [IPL 2015]. Thankachan et al. extended this result to computing a k-mismatch LCS in O(nlogk n) time for k = O(1) [J. Comput. Biol. 2016]. We show an O(nlogk\u22121/2 n)-time algorithm, for any constant integer k > 0 and irrespective of the alphabet size, using O(n) space as the previous approaches. We thus notably break through the well-known nlogk n barrier, which stems from a recursive heavy-path decomposition technique that was first introduced in the seminal paper of Cole et al. [STOC 2004] for string indexing with k errors."

  "description": "Orbital transformations to reduce the 1-norm of the electronic structure Hamiltonian for quantum computing applicationsReducing the complexity of quantum algorithms to treat quantum chemistry problems is essential to demonstrate an eventual quantum advantage of noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices over their classical counterpart. Significant improvements have been made recently to simulate the time-evolution operator U(t)=ei\u0124t, where \u0124 is the electronic structure Hamiltonian, or to simulate \u0124 directly (when written as a linear combination of unitaries) by using block encoding or qubitization techniques. A fundamental measure quantifying the practical implementation complexity of these quantum algorithms is the so-called 1-norm of the qubit representation of the Hamiltonian, which can be reduced by writing the Hamiltonian in factorized or tensor-hypercontracted forms, for instance. In this paper, we investigate the effect of classical preoptimization of the electronic structure Hamiltonian representation, via single-particle basis transformation, on the 1-norm. Specifically, we employ several localization schemes and benchmark the 1-norm of several systems of different sizes (number of atoms and active space sizes). We also derive a formula for the 1-norm as a function of the electronic integrals and use this quantity as a cost function for an orbital-optimization scheme that improves over localization schemes. This paper gives more insights about the importance of the 1-norm in quantum computing for quantum chemistry and provides simple ways of decreasing its value to reduce the complexity of quantum algorithms."

The complexity and interdependence of the networks of regulation of chemical substances have ensured that public health and wellbeing in the EU have continuously improved.

  "description": "Effects of ligands on (de-)enhancement of plasmonic excitations of silver, gold and bimetallic nanoclusters: TD-DFT+TB calculationsMetal nanoclusters can be synthesized in various sizes and shapes and are typically protected with ligands to stabilize them. These ligands can also be used to tune the plasmonic properties of the clusters as the absorption spectrum of a protected cluster can be significantly altered compared to the bare cluster. In this paper, we computationally investigate the influence of thiolate ligands on the plasmonic intensity for silver, gold and alloy clusters. Using time-dependent density functional theory with tight-binding approximations, TD-DFT+TB, we show that this level of theory can reproduce the broad experimental spectra of Au144(SR)60 and Ag53Au91(SR)60 (R = CH3) compounds with satisfactory agreement. As TD-DFT+TB does not depend on atom-type parameters we were able to apply this approach on large ligand-protected clusters with various compositions. With these calculations we predict that the effect of ligands on the absorption can be a quenching as well as an enhancement. We furthermore show that it is possible to unambiguously identify the plasmonic peaks by the scaled Coulomb kernel technique and explain the influence of ligands on the intensity (de-)enhancement by analyzing the plasmonic excitations in terms of the dominant orbital contributions."

The resulting ExaCorr module is primarily intended for calculations of molecules with one or more heavy elements, as relativistic effects on the electronic structure are included from the outset. In the current work, we thereby focus on exact two-component methods and demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the software. The module can be used as a stand-alone program requiring a set of molecular orbital coefficients as the starting point, but it is also interfaced to the DIRAC program that can be used to generate these. We therefore also briefly discuss an improvement of the parallel computing aspects of the relativistic self-consistent field algorithm of the DIRAC program."

The Nrf2 response returned to baseline within 24 h. The Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) regulated genes HSPA6 and FOSL-1 followed the Nrf2 time course. While the MTF1 genes also spiked at 4 h, they remained strongly elevated over the entire exposure period. The data and cell culture model utilised will be useful in further research aimed at the refinement of safe human exposure limits for cadmium, other metals and their mixtures."

Most inhibitors of NNMT described to date are structurally related to one or both of its substrates. In the search for structurally diverse NNMT inhibitors, an mRNA display screening technique was used to identify macrocyclic peptides which bind to NNMT. Several of the cyclic peptides identified in this manner show potent inhibition of NNMT with IC50 values as low as 229 nM. The peptides were also found to downregulate MNA production in cellular assays. Interestingly, substrate competition experiments reveal that these cyclic peptide inhibitors are noncompetitive with either SAM or NA indicating they may be the first allosteric inhibitors reported for NNMT."

  "description": "Atypical and Asymmetric 1,3-P,N Ligands: Synthesis, Coordination and Catalytic Performance of CycloiminophosphanesNovel seven-membered cyclic imine-based 1,3-P,N ligands were obtained by capturing a Beckmann nitrilium ion intermediate generated in situ from cyclohexanone with benzotriazole, and then displacing it by a secondary phosphane under triflic acid promotion. These \u201ccycloiminophosphanes\u201d possess flexible non-isomerizable tetrahydroazepine rings with a high basicity; this sets them apart from previously reported iminophophanes. The donor strength of the ligands was investigated by using their P-\u03ba1- and P,N-\u03ba2-tungsten(0) carbonyl complexes, by determining the IR frequency of the trans-CO ligands. Complexes with [RhCp*Cl2]2 demonstrated the hemilability of the ligands, giving a dynamic equilibrium of \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 species; treatment with AgOTf gives full conversion to the \u03ba2 complex. The potential for catalysis was shown in the RuII-catalyzed, solvent-free hydration of benzonitrile and the RuII- and IrI-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of cyclohexanone in isopropanol. Finally, to enable access to asymmetric catalysts, chiral cycloiminophosphanes were prepared from l-menthone, as well as their P,N-\u03ba2-RhIII and a P-\u03ba1-RuII complexes."

  "description": "Imaging and modelling of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) synthesis in Paracoccus denitrificansPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) granule formation in Paracoccus denitrificans Pd1222 was investigated by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) and gas chromatography analysis. Cells that had been starved for 2days were free of PHB granules but resynthesized them within 30min of growth in fresh medium with succinate. In most cases, the granules were distributed randomly, although in some cases they appeared in a more organized pattern. The rates of growth and PHB accumulation were analyzed within the frame of a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GSMM) containing 781 metabolic genes, 1403 reactions and 1503 metabolites. The model was used to obtain quantitative predictions of biomass yields and PHB synthesis during aerobic growth on succinate as sole carbon and energy sources. The results revealed an initial fast stage of PHB accumulation, during which all of the acetyl-CoA originating from succinate was diverted to PHB production. The next stage was characterized by a tenfold lower PHB production rate and the simultaneous onset of exponential growth, during which acetyl-CoA was predominantly drained into the TCA cycle. Previous research has shown that PHB accumulation correlates with cytosolic acetyl-CoA concentration. It has also been shown that PHB accumulation is not transcriptionally regulated. Our results are consistent with the mentioned findings and suggest that, in absence of cell growth, most of the cellular acetyl-CoA is channeled to PHB synthesis, while during exponential growth, it is drained to the TCA cycle, causing a reduction of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool and a concomitant decrease of the synthesis of acetoacetyl-CoA (the precursor of PHB synthesis)."

  "description": "Inter-laboratory mass spectrometry dataset based on passive sampling of drinking water for non-target analysisNon-target analysis (NTA) employing high-resolution mass spectrometry is a commonly applied approach for the detection of novel chemicals of emerging concern in complex environmental samples. NTA typically results in large and information-rich datasets that require computer aided (ideally automated) strategies for their processing and interpretation. Such strategies do however raise the challenge of reproducibility between and within different processing workflows. An effective strategy to mitigate such problems is the implementation of inter-laboratory studies (ILS) with the aim to evaluate different workflows and agree on harmonized/standardized quality control procedures. Here we present the data generated during such an ILS. This study was organized through the Norman Network and included 21 participants from 11 countries. A set of samples based on the passive sampling of drinking water pre and post treatment was shipped to all the participating laboratories for analysis, using one pre-defined method and one locally (i.e. in-house) developed method. The data generated represents a valuable resource (i.e. benchmark) for future developments of algorithms and workflows for NTA experiments."

This problem has been formalized by Bernardini et al.[ALENEX 2020] as it is the core computational problem in several string processing applications. It can be solved in O(n\u03c9) arithmetic operations by applying the well-known BEST theorem, where \u03c9&lt; 2.373 denotes the matrix multiplication exponent. The algorithmic challenge is: Can we solve this problem faster for certain values of m and z? Namely, we want to design a combinatorial algorithm for assessing whether # ET(G) \u2265 z, which does not resort to the BEST theorem and has a predictably bounded cost as a function of m and z. We address this challenge here by providing a combinatorial algorithm requiring O(m\u00b7 min { z, # ET(G) }) time."

  "description": "Ion Homeostasis and Metabolome Analysis of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 Quadruple Mutants to Salt StressSalinity is one of the major abiotic stresses that limits agricultural productivity worldwide. Many proteins with defined functions in salt stress adaptation are controlled through interactions with members of the 14-3-3 family. In the present study, we generated three 14-3-3 quadruple knockout mutants (qKOs: klpc, klun, and unpc) to study the role of six non-epsilon group 14-3-3 proteins for salt stress adaptation. The relative growth inhibition under 100 mM of NaCl stress was the same for wild-type (Wt) and qKOs, but the accumulation of Na+ in the shoots of klpc was significantly lower than that in Wt. This difference correlated with the higher expression of the HKT1 gene in klpc. Considering the regulatory role of 14-3-3 proteins in metabolism and the effect of salt stress on metabolite accumulation, we analyzed the effect of a 24-h salt treatment on the root metabolome of nutrient solution-grown genotypes. The results indicated that the klpc mutant had metabolome responses that were different from those of Wt. Notably, the reducing sugars, glucose and fructose, were lower in klpc under control and salt stress. On the other hand, their phosphorylated forms, glucose-6P and fructose-6P, were lower under salt stress as compared to Wt. This study provided insight into the functions of the 14-3-3 proteins from non-epsilon group members. In summary, it was found that these proteins control ion homeostasis and metabolite composition under salt stress conditions and non-stressed conditions. The analyses of single, double, and triple mutants that modify subsets from the most effective qKO mutant (klpc) may also reveal the potential redundancy for the observed phenotypes."

  "description": "Low-Order Scaling Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW for MoleculesLow-order scaling GW implementations for molecules are usually restricted to approximations with diagonal self-energy. Here, we present an all-electron implementation of quasiparticle self-consistent GW for molecular systems. We use an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the self-energy in imaginary time, from which a static non-local exchange-correlation potential is calculated via analytical continuation. By using a direct inversion of iterative subspace method, fast and stable convergence is achieved for almost all molecules in the GW100 database. Exceptions are systems which are associated with a breakdown of the single quasiparticle picture in the valence region. The implementation is proven to be starting point independent and good agreement of QP energies with other codes is observed. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of the new implementation by calculating the quasiparticle spectrum of a DNA oligomer with 1,220 electrons using a basis of 6,300 atomic orbitals in less than 4days on a single compute node with 16 cores. We use then our implementation to study the dependence of quasiparticle energies of DNA oligomers consisting of adenine-thymine pairs on the oligomer size. The first ionization potential in vacuum decreases by nearly 1 electron volt and the electron affinity increases by 0.4eV going from the smallest to the largest considered oligomer. This shows that the DNA environment stabilizes the hole/electron resulting from photoexcitation/photoattachment. Upon inclusion of the aqueous environment via a polarizable continuum model, the differences between the ionization potentials reduce to 130meV, demonstrating that the solvent effectively compensates for the stabilizing effect of the DNA environment. The electron affinities of the different oligomers are almost identical in the aqueous environment."

  "description": "Fluorescent tagging of endogenous Heme oxygenase-1 in human induced pluripotent stem cells for high content imaging of oxidative stress in various differentiated lineagesTagging of endogenous stress response genes can provide valuable in vitro models for chemical safety assessment. Here, we present the generation and application of a fluorescent human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) reporter line for Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), which is considered a sensitive and reliable biomarker for the oxidative stress response. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to insert an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) at the C-terminal end of the endogenous HMOX1 gene. Individual clones were selected and extensively characterized to confirm precise editing and retained stem cell properties. Bardoxolone-methyl (CDDO-Me) induced oxidative stress caused similarly increased expression of both the wild-type and eGFP-tagged HMOX1 at the mRNA and protein level. Fluorescently tagged hiPSC-derived proximal tubule-like, hepatocyte-like, cardiomyocyte-like and neuron-like progenies were treated with CDDO-Me (5.62-1000 nM) or diethyl maleate (5.62-1000 \u00b5M) for 24 h and 72 h. Multi-lineage oxidative stress responses were assessed through transcriptomics analysis, and HMOX1-eGFP reporter expression was carefully monitored using live-cell confocal imaging. We found that eGFP intensity increased in a dose-dependent manner with dynamics varying amongst lineages and stressors. Point of departure modelling further captured the specific lineage sensitivities towards oxidative stress. We anticipate that the newly developed HMOX1 hiPSC reporter will become a valuable tool in understanding and quantifying critical target organ cell-specific oxidative stress responses induced by (newly developed) chemical entities."

  "description": "Origin of asynchronicity in Diels-Alder reactionsAsynchronicity in Diels-Alder reactions plays a crucial role in determining the height of the reaction barrier. Currently, the origin of asynchronicity is ascribed to the stronger orbital interaction between the diene and the terminal carbon of an asymmetric dienophile, which shortens the corresponding newly formed C-C bond and hence induces asynchronicity in the reaction. Here, we show, using the activation strain model and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital theory at ZORA-BP86/TZ2P, that this rationale behind asynchronicity is incorrect. We, in fact, found that following a more asynchronous reaction mode costs favorable HOMO-LUMO orbital overlap and, therefore, weakens (not strengthens) these orbital interactions. Instead, it is the Pauli repulsion that induces asynchronicity in Diels-Alder reactions. An asynchronous reaction pathway also lowers repulsive occupied-occupied orbital overlap which, therefore, reduces the unfavorable Pauli repulsion. As soon as this mechanism of reducing Pauli repulsion dominates, the reaction begins to deviate from synchronicity and adopts an asynchronous mode. The eventual degree of asynchronicity, as observed in the transition state of a Diels-Alder reaction, is ultimately achieved when the gain in stability, as a response to the reduced Pauli repulsion, balances with the loss of favorable orbital interactions."

  "description": "A method to monitor the NAD+ metabolome\u2014from mechanistic to clinical applicationsNicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its reduced form (NADH) are coenzymes employed in hundreds of metabolic reactions. NAD+ also serves as a substrate for enzymes such as sirtuins, poly(ADP\u2010ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and ADP\u2010ribosyl cyclases. Given the pivotal role of NAD(H) in health and disease, studying NAD+ metabolism has become essential to monitor ge-netic\u2010 and/or drug\u2010induced perturbations related to metabolic status and diseases (such as ageing, cancer or obesity), and its possible therapies. Here, we present a strategy based on liquid chroma-tography\u2010tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2010MS/MS), for the analysis of the NAD+ metabolome in biological samples. In this method, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) was used to sep-arate a total of 18 metabolites belonging to pathways leading to NAD+ biosynthesis, including pre-cursors, intermediates and catabolites. As redox cofactors are known for their instability, a sample preparation procedure was developed to handle a variety of biological matrices: cell models, rodent tissues and biofluids, as well as human biofluids (urine, plasma, serum, whole blood). For clinical applications, quantitative LC\u2010MS/MS for a subset of metabolites was demonstrated for the analysis of the human whole blood of nine volunteers. Using this developed workflow, our methodology allows studying NAD+ biology from mechanistic to clinical applications."

  "description": "Dipolar repulsion in \u03b1-halocarbonyl compounds revisitedThe concept of dipolar repulsion has been widely used to explain several phenomena in organic chemistry, including the conformational preferences of carbonyl compounds. This model, in which atoms and bonds are viewed as point charges and dipole moment vectors, respectively, is however oversimplified. To provide a causal model rooted in quantitative molecular orbital theory, we have analyzed the rotational isomerism of haloacetaldehydes OHC-CH2X (X = F, Cl, Br, I), using relativistic density functional theory. We have found that the overall trend in the rotational energy profiles is set by the combined effects of Pauli repulsion (introducing a barrier around gauche that separates minima at syn and anti), orbital interactions (which can pull the anti minimum towards anticlinal to maximize hyperconjugation), and electrostatic interactions. Only for X = F, not for X = Cl-I, electrostatic interactions push the preference from syn to anti. Our bonding analyses show how this trend is related to the compact nature of F versus the more diffuse nature of the heavier halogens."

The studied LAs efficiently accelerate the ene reaction by lowering the reaction barrier up to 12 kcal mol\u22121 compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. Our detailed activation strain and Kohn-Sham molecular orbital analyses reveal that coordination of a LA catalyst to the enophile decreases the reaction barrier of the ene reaction by inducing an asymmetry in the \u03c0-electronic system, which increases the asynchronicity and hence relieves the otherwise highly destabilizing activation strain and Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled \u03c0-orbitals of the ene and enophile.

  "description": "Probing the formation of isolated cyclo-FF peptide clusters by far-infrared action spectroscopySmall cyclic peptides containing phenylalanine residues are prone to aggregate in the gas phase into highly hydrophobic chains. A combination of laser desorption, mass spectrometry and conformational selective IR-UV action spectroscopy allows us to obtain detailed structural insights into the formation processes of the cyclic l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine dipeptide (named cyclo-FF) aggregates. The rigid properties of cyclo-FF result in highly resolved IR spectra for the smaller clusters (n \u2264 3) and corresponding conformational assignments. For the higher order clusters (n > 3) the spectra are less resolved, however the observed ratios, peak positions and trends in IR shifts are key to make predictions on their structural details. Whereas the mid-IR spectral region between 1000-1800 cm-1 turns out to be undiagnostic for these small aggregates and the 3 \u03bcm region only for specific calculated structures, the far-IR contains valuable information that allows for clear assignments.

  "description": "Steering microbiomes by organic amendments towards climate-smart agricultural soilsWe steered the soil microbiome via applications of organic residues (mix of cover crop residues, sewage sludge + compost, and digestate + compost) to enhance multiple ecosystem services in line with climate-smart agriculture. Our result highlights the potential to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from agricultural soils by the application of specific organic amendments (especially digestate + compost). Unexpectedly, also the addition of mineral fertilizer in our mesocosms led to similar combined GHG emissions than one of the specific organic amendments. However, the application of organic amendments has the potential to increase soil C, which is not the case when using mineral fertilizer. While GHG emissions from cover crop residues were significantly higher compared to mineral fertilizer and the other organic amendments, crop growth was promoted. Furthermore, all organic amendments induced a shift in the diversity and abundances of key microbial groups. We show that organic amendments have the potential to not only lower GHG emissions by modifying the microbial community abundance and composition, but also favour crop growth-promoting microorganisms. This modulation of the microbial community by organic amendments bears the potential to turn soils into more climate-smart soils in comparison to the more conventional use of mineral fertilizers."

  "description": "A method for intuitively extracting macromolecular dynamics from structural disorderMacromolecular dynamics manifest as disorder in structure determination, which is subsequently accounted for by displacement parameters (also called temperature factors, or B-factors) or alternate conformations. Though B-factors contain detailed information about structural dynamics, they are the total of multiple sources of disorder, making them difficult to interpret and thus little-used in structural analysis. We report here an analytical approach for decomposing molecular disorder into a parsimonious hierarchical series of contributions, providing an intuitive basis for quantitative structural-dynamics analysis. We demonstrate the decomposition of disorder on example SARS-CoV-2 and STEAP4 structures, from both crystallographic and cryo-electron microscopy data, and reveal how understanding of the macromolecular disorder leads to deeper understanding of molecular motions and flexibility, and suggests hypotheses for molecular mechanisms."

Analytical methods should be developed to identify, characterize, and quantify sub-micron particulate plastic in biota to understand their biological fate in terms of biodistribution, localization, bioaccumulation and clearance. Here we give a perspective on a promising workflow of sample preparation methods and techniques that could enable analysis of sub-micron plastics in biological matrices and discuss their application for biological fate studies of particulate plastic in organisms. We also expect these methods to be largely transferrable to studies considering sub-micron plastics in food, consumer products, human and some environmental compartments."

  "description": "Population dynamics of microbial cross-feeding are determined by co-localization probabilities and cooperation-independent cheater growthAs natural selection acts on individual organisms the evolution of costly cooperation between microorganisms is an intriguing phenomenon. Introduction of spatial structure to privatize exchanged molecules can explain the evolution of cooperation. However, in many natural systems cells can also grow to low cell concentrations in the absence of these exchanged molecules, thus showing \u201ccooperation-independent background growth\u201d. We here serially propagated a synthetic cross-feeding consortium of lactococci in the droplets of a water-in-oil emulsion, essentially mimicking group selection with varying founder population sizes. The results show that when the growth of cheaters completely depends on cooperators, cooperators outcompete cheaters. However, cheaters outcompete cooperators when they can independently grow to only ten percent of the consortium carrying capacity. This result is the consequence of a probabilistic effect, as low founder population sizes in droplets decrease the frequency of cooperator co-localization. Cooperator-enrichment can be recovered by increasing the founder population size in droplets to intermediate values. Together with mathematical modelling our results suggest that co-localization probabilities in a spatially structured environment leave a small window of opportunity for the evolution of cooperation between organisms that do not benefit from their cooperative trait when in isolation or form multispecies aggregates."

However, due to its laborious and cost intensive nature, iPSC research is often plagued by limited sample size and putative large variability between clones, decreasing statistical power for detecting experimental effects. Here, we investigate the source and magnitude of variability in the proteome of parallel differentiated astrocytes using mass spectrometry. We compare three possible sources of variability: inter-donor variability, inter- and intra-clonal variability, at different stages of maturation. We show that the interclonal variability is significantly smaller than the inter-donor variability, and that including more donors has a much larger influence on statistical power than adding more clones per donor. Our results provide insight into the sources of variability at protein level between iPSC samples derived in parallel and will aid in optimizing iPSC studies."

  "description": "Project earthrise: Proceedings of the ninth annual conference of inVIVO planetary healthThe \u201cEarthrise\u201d photograph, taken on the 1968 Apollo 8 mission, became one of the most significant images of the 20th Century. It triggered a profound shift in environmental awareness and the potential for human unity\u2014inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970. Taking inspiration from these events 50 years later, we initiated Project Earthrise at our 2020 annual conference of inVIVO Planetary Health. This builds on the emergent concept of planetary health, which provides a shared narrative to integrate rich and diverse approaches from all aspects of society towards shared solutions to global challenges. The acute catastrophe of the COVID-19 pandemic has drawn greater attention to many other interconnected global health, environmental, social, spiritual, and economic problems that have been underappreciated or neglected for decades. This is accelerating opportunities for greater collaborative action, as many groups now focus on the necessity of a \u201cGreat Transition\u201d. While ambitious integrative efforts have never been more important, it is imperative to apply these with mutualistic value systems as a compass, as we seek to make wiser choices. Project Earthrise is our contribution to this important process. This underscores the imperative for creative ecological solutions to challenges in all systems, on all scales with advancing global urbanization in the digital age\u2014for personal, environmental, economic and societal health alike. At the same time, our agenda seeks to equally consider our social and spiritual ecology as it does natural ecology. Revisiting the inspiration of \u201cEarthrise\u201d, we welcome diverse perspectives from across all dimensions of the arts and the sciences, to explore novel solutions and new normative values. Building on academic rigor, we seek to place greater value on imagination, kindness and mutualism as we address our greatest challenges, for the health of people, places and planet."

  "description": "Electronic spectra of ytterbium fluoride from relativistic electronic structure calculationsWe report an investigation of the low-lying excited states of the YbF molecule-a candidate molecule for experimental measurements of the electron electric dipole moment-with 2-component based multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI), equation of motion coupled cluster (EOM-CCSD) and the extrapolated intermediate Hamiltonian Fock-space coupled cluster (XIHFS-CCSD). Specifically, we address the question of the nature of these low-lying states in terms of configurations containing filled or partially-filled Yb 4f shells. We show that while it does not appear possible to carry out calculations with both kinds of configurations contained in the same active space, reliable information can be extracted from different sectors of Fock space-that is, by performing electron attachment and detachment IHFS-CCSD and EOM-CCSD calculation on the closed-shell YbF+ and YbF- species, respectively. From these calculations we predict \u03a9 = 1/2, 3/2 states, arising from the 4f13\u03c326s, 4f145d1/6p1, and 4f135d1\u03c316s configurations to be able to interact as they appear in the same energy range around the ground-state equilibrium geometry. As these states are generated from different sectors of Fock space, they are almost orthogonal and provide complementary descriptions of parts of the excited state manifold. To obtain a comprehensive picture, we introduce a simple adiabatization model to extract energies of interacting \u03a9 = 1/2, 3/2 states that can be compared to experimental observations."

Here, via ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, we show that the PL in these 0D metal halides is thermally quenched well below 300 K via strong electron-phonon coupling. To unravel the source of green emission reported for bulk 0D systems, we further study two previously suggested candidate green emitters: (i) a Br vacancy, which we demonstrate to present a strong thermal emission quenching at room temperature; (ii) an impurity, based on octahedral connectivity, that succeeds in suppressing nonradiative quenching via a reduced electron-phonon coupling in the corner-shared lead bromide octahedral network. These findings contribute to unveiling the mechanism behind the temperature-dependent PL in lead halide materials of different dimensionality. "

One purpose is to obtain a set of consistent homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) for establishing accurate trends across the periodic table. The main objective is to elucidate the underlying physical factors behind these chemical bonding trends. On one hand, we confirm that, along a period (e. g., from C\u2212C to C\u2212F), bonds strengthen because the electronegativity difference across the bond increases. But, down a period, our findings constitute a paradigm shift. From C\u2212F to C\u2212I, for example, bonds do become weaker, however, not because of the decreasing electronegativity difference. Instead, we show that the effective atom size (via steric Pauli repulsion) is the causal factor behind bond weakening in this series, and behind the weakening in orbital interactions at the equilibrium distance. We discuss the actual bonding mechanism and the importance of analyzing this mechanism as a function of the bond distance."

PBs can contain high concentrations of antigen, are stable and relatively resistant to proteases, release antigen slowly and are cost-effective to manufacture. Yet, the capacity of PBs to provoke immune responses and protection in the upper respiratory tract, a major entry route of respiratory pathogens, is largely unknown. In this study, we vaccinated mice intranasally with PBs comprising antigens from Streptococcus pneumoniae and evaluated the level of protection against nasopharyngeal colonization. PBs composed of the \u03b1-helical domain of pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA\u03b1) provided superior protection against colonization with S. pneumoniae compared to soluble PspA\u03b1. Immunization with soluble protein or PBs induced differences in antibody binding to pneumococci as well as a highly distinct antigen-specific nasal cytokine profile upon in vivo stimulation with inactivated S. pneumoniae. Moreover, immunization with PBs composed of conserved putative pneumococcal antigens reduced colonization by S. pneumoniae in mice, both as a single- and as a multi-antigen formulation. In conclusion, PBs represent a vaccine formulation that elicits strong mucosal immune responses and protection. The versatility of this platform offers opportunities for development of next-generation vaccine formulations."

Here, we investigate three PAH molecules: fluorene, phenanthrene, and pyrene, using ultrafast XUV and IR laser pulses. Simultaneous measurements of the ion yields, ion momenta, and electron momenta as a function of laser pulse delay allow a detailed insight into the various molecular processes. We report relaxation times for the electronically excited PAH*, PAH+* and PAH2+* states, and show the time-dependent conversion between fragmentation pathways. Additionally, using recoil-frame covariance analysis between ion images, we demonstrate that the dissociation of the PAH2+ ions favors reaction pathways involving two-body breakup and/or loss of neutral fragments totaling an even number of carbon atoms."

  "description": "The escherichia coli outer membrane \u03b2-barrel assembly machinery (Bam) crosstalks with the divisomeThe BAM is a macromolecular machine responsible for the folding and the insertion of integral proteins into the outer membrane of diderm Gram-negative bacteria. In Escherichia coli, it consists of a transmembrane \u03b2-barrel subunit, BamA, and four outer membrane lipoproteins (BamB-E). Using BAM-specific antibodies, in E. coli cells, the complex is shown to localize in the lateral wall in foci. The machinery was shown to be enriched at midcell with specific cell cycle timing. The inhibition of septation by aztreonam did not alter the BAM midcell localization substantially. Furthermore, the absence of late cell division proteins at midcell did not impact BAM timing or localization. These results imply that the BAM enrichment at the site of constriction does not require an active cell division machinery. Expression of the Tre1 toxin, which impairs the FtsZ filamentation and therefore midcell localization, resulted in the complete loss of BAM midcell enrichment. A similar effect was observed for YidC, which is involved in the membrane insertion of cell division proteins in the inner membrane. The presence of the Z-ring is needed for preseptal peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. As BAM was shown to be embedded in the PG layer, it is possible that BAM is inserted preferentially simultaneously with de novo PG synthesis to facilitate the insertion of OMPs in the newly synthesized outer membrane."

The biogenic amines (BAs) cadaverine, putrescine and tyramine are known to be causative compounds. Recent reports suggest these compounds produced by pathogens might have a role beyond causing malodour; namely inhibiting the growth of lactobacilli bacteria that are crucial in the maintenance of vaginal homeostasis. The aim of this study was to identify whether certain lactobacilli strains could reduce BAs and to evaluate how Lactobacillus species were affected by these compounds. Using LC\u2013MS and HPLC-UV, five Lactobacillus crispatus strains were identified as being capable of significantly reducing BAs from the media under in vitro conditions. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing of vaginal swabs exposed to Bas, cadaverine was found to reduce the relative abundance of lactobacilli. When L. crispatus was exposed to media supplemented with BAs with an HCl adjusted lower pH, its growth was enhanced, demonstrating the relevance of the maintenance of an acidic vaginal environment. If strains are to be developed for probiotic application to alleviate bacterial vaginosis and other conditions affecting large numbers of women worldwide, their ability to adapt to Bas and regulate pH should be part of the experimentation."

  "description": "Age-related susceptibility to insulin resistance arises from a combination of CPT1B decline and lipid overloadBackground: The skeletal muscle plays a central role in glucose homeostasis through the uptake of glucose from the extracellular medium in response to insulin. A number of factors are known to disrupt the normal response to insulin leading to the emergence of insulin resistance (IR). Advanced age and a high-fat diet are factors that increase the susceptibility to IR, with lipid accumulation in the skeletal muscle being a key driver of this phenomenon. It is debated, however, whether lipid accumulation arises due to dietary lipid overload or from a decline of mitochondrial function. To gain insights into the interplay of diet and age in the flexibility of muscle lipid and glucose handling, we combined lipidomics, proteomics, mitochondrial function analysis and computational modelling to investigate young and aged mice on a low- or high-fat diet (HFD). Results: As expected, aged mice were more susceptible to IR when given a HFD than young mice. The HFD induced intramuscular lipid accumulation specifically in aged mice, including C18:0-containing ceramides and diacylglycerols. This was reflected by the mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation capacity, which was upregulated by the HFD in young, but not in old mice. Conspicuously, most \u03b2-oxidation proteins were upregulated by the HFD in both groups, but carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1B (CPT1B) declined in aged animals. Computational modelling traced the flux control mostly to CPT1B, suggesting a CPT1B-driven loss of flexibility to the HFD with age. Finally, in old animals, glycolytic protein levels were reduced and less flexible to the diet. Conclusion: We conclude that intramuscular lipid accumulation and decreased insulin sensitivity are not due to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction or nutritional overload alone, but rather to their combined effects. Moreover, we identify CPT1B as a potential target to counteract age-dependent intramuscular lipid accumulation and thereby IR."

  "description": "High biodiversity in a benzene-degrading nitrate-reducing culture is sustained by a few primary consumersA key question in microbial ecology is what the driving forces behind the persistence of large biodiversity in natural environments are. We studied a microbial community with more than 100 different types of species which evolved in a 15-years old bioreactor with benzene as the main carbon and energy source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. Using genome-centric metagenomics plus metatranscriptomics, we demonstrate that most of the community members likely feed on metabolic left-overs or on necromass while only a few of them, from families Rhodocyclaceae and Peptococcaceae, are candidates to degrade benzene. We verify with an additional succession experiment using metabolomics and metabarcoding that these few community members are the actual drivers of benzene degradation. As such, we hypothesize that high species richness is maintained and the complexity of a natural community is stabilized in a controlled environment by the interdependencies between the few benzene degraders and the rest of the community members, ultimately resulting in a food web with different trophic levels."

  "description": "High throughput screening of technological and biopreservation traits of a large set of wild lactic acid bacteria from Brazilian artisanal cheesesThis study aimed to evaluate technological (acidification, proteolysis, lipolysis, resistance to low pH, NaCl, and bile salts) and biopreservation (antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens) features of 1002 LAB by high throughput screening (HTS) methods. The LAB was isolated from 11 types of Brazilian artisanal cheeses (BAC) marketed in the main 5 producing regions. Remarkable intra-species variability in acidification rates have been found, which was most pronounced between isolates from Mina's artisanal cheeses, Caipira and Coalho cheeses. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei and Levilactobacillus brevis showed the fastest acidification rate; however, all isolates showed slower acidification rates than a lactococcal control strain (4.3 \u00d7 lower). When testing inhibitory effects, > 75% of LAB isolates could inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19095 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 7644. Two of these isolates, identified as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lentilactobacillus buchneri, the sterile and neutral supernatants alone, were sufficient to inhibit L. monocytogenes growth. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed the identification of functional groups based on proteolytic and lipolytic activity, osmotic stress resistance, and inhibition of L. monocytogenes. The type of cheese the isolates were recovered from influenced properties such as anti-listerial compounds and lipolytic enzyme production. The use of HTS and multivariate statistics allowed insights into a diverse set of LAB technological and biopreservation properties. These findings allow a profound knowledge of the heterogeneity of a large set of isolates, which can be further used to design starter cultures with varied and combined properties, such as biopreservation and technological features. Besides that, HTS makes it possible to analyze a vast panel of LAB strains, reducing costs and time within laboratory analysis, while avoiding the loss of information once all LAB are tested at the same time (differently from the traditional labor-intensive approach, in which a few numbers of strains is tested per time)."

  "description": "Metabolomics of sebum reveals lipid dysregulation in Parkinson\u2019s diseaseParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which is characterised by degeneration of distinct neuronal populations, including dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Here, we use a metabolomics profiling approach to identify changes to lipids in PD observed in sebum, a non-invasively available biofluid. We used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyse 274 samples from participants (80 drug na\u00efve PD, 138 medicated PD and 56 well matched control subjects) and detected metabolites that could predict PD phenotype. Pathway enrichment analysis shows alterations in lipid metabolism related to the carnitine shuttle, sphingolipid metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. This study shows sebum can be used to identify potential biomarkers for PD."

  "description": "Overproducing the BAM complex improves secretion of difficult-to-secrete recombinant autotransporter chimerasMonomeric autotransporters have been used extensively to transport recombinant proteins or protein domains to the cell surface of Gram-negative bacteria amongst others for antigen display. Genetic fusion of such antigens into autotransporters has yielded chimeras that can be used for vaccination purposes. However, not every fusion construct is transported efficiently across the cell envelope. Problems occur in particular when the fused antigen attains a relatively complex structure in the periplasm, prior to its translocation across the outer membrane. The latter step requires the interaction with periplasmic chaperones and the BAM (\u03b2-barrel assembly machinery) complex in the outer membrane. This complex catalyzes insertion and folding of \u03b2-barrel outer membrane proteins, including the \u03b2-barrel domain of autotransporters. Here, we investigated whether the availability of periplasmic chaperones or the BAM complex is a limiting factor for the surface localization of difficult-to-secrete chimeric autotransporter constructs. Indeed, we found that overproduction of in particular the BAM complex, increases surface display of difficult-to-secrete chimeras. Importantly, this beneficial effect appeared to be generic not only for a number of monomeric autotransporter fusions but also for fusions to trimeric autotransporters. Therefore, overproduction of BAM might be an attractive strategy to improve the production of recombinant autotransporter constructs."
