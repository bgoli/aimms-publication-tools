  "description": "Facilities that make the PDB data collection more powerfulWe describe a series of databases and tools that directly or indirectly support biomedical research on macromolecules, with focus on their applicability in protein structure bioinformatics research. DSSP, that determines secondary structures of proteins, has been updated to work well with extremely large structures in multiple formats. The PDBREPORT database that lists anomalies in protein structures has been remade to remove many small problems. These reports are now available as PDF-formatted files with a computer-readable summary. The VASE software has been added to analyze and visualize HSSP multiple sequence alignments for protein structures. The Lists collection of databases has been extended with a series of databases, most noticeably with a database that gives each protein structure a grade for usefulness in protein structure bioinformatics projects. The PDB-REDO collection of reanalyzed and re-refined protein structures that were solved by X-ray crystallography has been improved by dealing better with sugar residues and with hydrogen bonds, and adding many missing surface loops. All academic software underlying these protein structure bioinformatics applications and databases are now publicly accessible, either directly from the authors or from the GitHub software repository."

  "description": "Real-time imaging of multivesicular body\u2013plasma membrane fusion to quantify exosome release from single cellsExosomes are small extracellular vesicles with a diameter of 40\u2013150 nm, and are implicated in cellular homeostasis and cell\u2013cell communication. They can be secreted in bulk in response to cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic signals that cause multivesicular body (MVB) fusion with the plasma membrane (PM). However, research on the regulation of exosome release is hampered by the failure of current methods to capture the dynamics of exosome release. Here we describe how live imaging with tetraspanin-based pH-sensitive fluorescent reporters can quantify the MVB\u2013PM fusion rate of single cells. Our approach enables identification of exogenous stimuli, signaling pathways, and fusion complexes, and can map subcellular sites of fusion events. In addition, dual-color imaging can be used to assess simultaneous release of different cargo by MVB exocytosis. This protocol describes the complete imaging experiment, consisting of transient expression of tetraspanin reporters (2 d), live-cell (dual-color) total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (30\u201360 min per condition), and semiautomatic image analysis by using a newly developed ImageJ macro (\u00b130 min per condition)."

  "description": "Analytics for bioactivity profiling of complex mixtures with a focus on venomsThis chapter introduces bioactivity and bioaffinity terms in relation to mixture profiling and gives the significance of bioactivity and/or bioaffinity profiling of biologically active mixtures in general, and for bioactive mixtures in drug discovery research in particular. Further, the chapter gives an overview of the common and less common analytical approaches for bioactivity profiling of bioactive mixtures. Special focus is put on bioassay-guided fractionation as the standard technique employed (in identification and purification of bioactive molecules from a bioactive mixture), and on state-of-the-art post-column bioactivity profiling approaches, also providing examples and limitations of these analytical methods. On-column and pre-column bioactivity profiling analytics is also discussed. Examples of bioactive molecules identified and purified from different natural products are given with emphasis on molecules isolated from animal venoms. Finally, this chapter briefly discusses the importance of bioactivity profiling of metabolic mixtures in drug discovery."

  "description": "Elementary Growth Modes provide a molecular description of cellular self-fabricationIn this paper we try to describe all possible molecular states (phenotypes) for a cell that fabricates itself at a constant rate, given its enzyme kinetics and the stoichiometry of all reactions. For this, we must understand the process of cellular growth: steady-state self-fabrication requires a cell to synthesize all of its components, including metabolites, enzymes and ribosomes, in proportions that match its own composition. Simultaneously, the concentrations of these components affect the rates of metabolism and biosynthesis, and hence the growth rate. We here derive a theory that describes all phenotypes that solve this circular problem. All phenotypes can be described as a combination of minimal building blocks, which we call Elementary Growth Modes (EGMs). EGMs can be used as the theoretical basis for all models that explicitly model self-fabrication, such as the currently popular Metabolism and Expression models. We then use our theory to make concrete biological predictions. We find that natural selection for maximal growth rate drives microorganisms to states of minimal phenotypic complexity: only one EGM will be active when growth rate is maximised. The phenotype of a cell is only extended with one more EGM whenever growth becomes limited by an additional biophysical constraint, such as a limited solvent capacity of a cellular compartment. The theory presented here extends recent results on Elementary Flux Modes: the minimal building blocks of cellular growth models that lack the self-fabrication aspect. Our theory starts from basic biochemical and evolutionary considerations, and describes unicellular life, both in growth-promoting and in stress-inducing environments, in terms of EGMs."

  "description": "Identification of mutagenic and endocrine disrupting compounds in surface water and wastewater treatment plant effluents using high-resolution effect-directed analysisEffect-directed analysis (EDA) has shown its added value for the detection and identification of compounds with varying toxicological properties in water quality research. However, for routine toxicity assessment of multiple toxicological endpoints, current EDA is considered labor intensive and time consuming. To achieve faster EDA and identification, a high-throughput (HT) EDA platform, coupling a downscaled luminescent Ames and cell-based reporter gene assays with a high-resolution fraction collector and UPLC-QTOF MS, was developed. The applicability of the HT-EDA platform in the analysis of aquatic samples was demonstrated by analysis of extracts from WWTP influent, effluent and surface water. Downscaled assays allowed detection of mutagenicity and androgen, estrogen and glucocorticoid agonism following high-resolution fractionation in 228 fractions. From 8 masses tentatively identified through non-target analysis, 2 masses were further investigated and chemically and biologically confirmed as the mutagen 1,2,3-benzotriazole and the androgen androstenedione. The compatibility of the high-throughput EDA platform with analysis of water samples and the incorporation of mutagenic and endocrine disruption endpoints allow for future application in routine monitoring in drinking water quality control and improved identification of (emerging) mutagens and endocrine disruptors."

  "description": "NIST Interlaboratory Study on Glycosylation Analysis of Monoclonal Antibodies: Comparison of Results from Diverse Analytical MethodsGlycosylation is a topic of intense current interest in the development of biopharmaceuticals because it is related to drug safety and efficacy. This work describes results of an interlaboratory study on the glycosylation of the Primary Sample (PS) of NISTmAb, a monoclonal antibody reference material. Seventy-six laboratories from industry, university, research, government, and hospital sectors in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia submitted a total of 103 reports on glycan distributions. The principal objective of this study was to report and compare results for the full range of analytical methods presently used in the glycosylation analysis of mAbs. Therefore, participation was unrestricted, with laboratories choosing their own measurement techniques. Protein glycosylation was determined in various ways, including at the level of intact mAb, protein fragments, glycopeptides, or released glycans, using a wide variety of methods for derivatization, separation, identification, and quantification. Consequently, the diversity of results was enormous, with the number of glycan compositions identified by each laboratory ranging from 4 to 48. In total, one hundred sixteen glycan compositions were reported, of which 57 compositions could be assigned consensus abundance values. These consensus medians provide community-derived values for NISTmAb PS. Agreement with the consensus medians did not depend on the specific method or laboratory type. The study provides a view of the current state-of-the-art for biologic glycosylation measurement and suggests a clear need for harmonization of glycosylation analysis methods."

In this study the \u01a9SCCPs, \u01a9MCCPs, and \u01a9LCCP concentrations are reported for South African indoor dust and pet cat hair. The median concentrations of the \u01a9CPs (C9-C37) ranged from 33 to 663\u202f\u03bcg/g for freshly collected dust (FD), 36-488\u202f\u03bcg/g for dust collected from household vacuum cleaner bags (VD), and 1.2-15\u202f\u03bcg/g for cat hair (CH) samples. MCCPs were the dominant CP group, followed by SCCPs and LCCPs. The \u01a9MCCP concentration ranged from 13 to 498\u202f\u03bcg/g in dust and 0.6-6.5\u202f\u03bcg/g in cat hair. SCCPs with shorter carbon chains and lower chlorine substitution were observed in cat hair. LCCPs with carbon chains\u202f>\u202fC20 were detected in dust and hair samples, possibly indicating the use of wax grade LCCP formulations. Non-traditional Kendrick mass defect plots were used to obtain information on the magnitude of CPs and provide evidence of possible interfering compounds. This is the first report on the occurrence of SCCPs, MCCPs, and LCCPs in the South African indoor environment."

  "description": "Stitching the synapse: Cross-linking mass spectrometry into resolving synaptic protein interactionsSynaptic transmission is the predominant form of communication in the brain. It requires functionally specialized molecular machineries constituted by thousands of interacting synaptic proteins. Here, we made use of recent advances in cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) in combination with biochemical and computational approaches to reveal the architecture and assembly of synaptic protein complexes from mouse brain hippocampus and cerebellum. We obtained 11,999 unique lysine-lysine cross-links, comprising connections within and between 2362 proteins. This extensive collection was the basis to identify novel protein partners, to model protein conformational dynamics, and to delineate within and between protein interactions of main synaptic constituents, such as Camk2, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor, and associated proteins. Using XL-MS, we generated a protein interaction resource that we made easily accessible via a web-based platform (http://xlink.cncr.nl) to provide new entries into exploration of all protein interactions identified."

  "description": "The world is your oyster: low-dose, long-term microplastic exposure of juvenile oystersBivalve filter feeders, such as oysters, filter large volumes of water and are particularly exposed to microplastics (MP). Consequently, these animals digest and assimilate high levels of MP in their bodies that may likely impact their physiology, and potentially affect shellfish stocks, benthic habitats and, indirectly, the health status of the marine ecosystem and human consumers. In this study we exposed juvenile oysters, Crassostrea gigas, to 3 different MP concentrations (104, 105 and 106 particles L\u22121), represented by 6\u03bcm Polystyrene (PS) microbeads, compared to a control treatment receiving no MP. The study ran for a period of 80 days to test for the impacts of MP on growth, Condition Index and Lysosomal Stability. From histological analysis, microbeads were detected in the intestines of exposed oysters and in the digestive tubules, but no cellular inflammatory features were observed over time. Weight and shell length remained comparable between the different treatments and control. We found that Condition Index in the highest concentration increased initially but significantly reduced over time. The oysters in the highest MP exposure also showed the lowest mean Lysosomal Stability score throughout the experiment. Lysosomes play a vital role in the cells defense mechanisms and breakdown of constituents, crucial for the oysters\u2019 wellbeing. Most importantly, we detected an increased mortality in those oysters who were chronically exposed to the highest loads of MP."

  "description": "Fermented foods in a global age: East meets WestFermented foods and alcoholic beverages have long been an important part of the human diet in nearly every culture on every continent. These foods are often well-preserved and serve as stable and significant sources of proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Despite these common features, however, many differences exist with respect to substrates and products and the types of microbes involved in the manufacture of fermented foods and beverages produced globally. In this review, we describe these differences and consider the influence of geography and industrialization on fermented foods manufacture. Whereas fermented foods produced in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand usually depend on defined starter cultures, those made in Asia and Africa often rely on spontaneous fermentation. Likewise, in developing countries, fermented foods are not often commercially produced on an industrial scale. Although many fermented products rely on autochthonous microbes present in the raw material, for other products, the introduction of starter culture technology has led to greater consistency, safety, and quality. The diversity and function of microbes present in a wide range of fermented foods can now be examined in detail using molecular and other omic approaches. The nutritional value of fermented foods is now well-appreciated, especially in resource-poor regions where yoghurt and other fermented foods can improve public health and provide opportunities for economic development. Manufacturers of fermented foods, whether small or large, should follow Good Manufacturing Practices and have sustainable development goals. Ultimately, preferences for fermented foods and beverages depend on dietary habits of consumers, as well as regional agricultural conditions and availability of resources."

  "description": "Aggregation induced emission of a new naphthyridine-ethynyl-gold(i) complex as a potential tool for sensing guanosine nucleotides in aqueous mediaA new organometallic alkynyl-gold(i) complex capable of exhibiting aggregation induced emission was designed and synthesized. The linear complex structure possesses a central Au(i) atom, bearing two axial ligands: (1) 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane and (2) 2-acetamido-7-ethynyl-1,8-naphthyridine. While the former accounts for its partial solubility in an aqueous environment, the latter acts as a receptor unit for binding guanosine nucleotides and derivatives via multiple hydrogen bonding interactions. At high concentrations, aggregation of the complex was observed by the formation of new absorption (\u03bbmax \u223c 400 nm) and emission bands (550-700 nm). Formation of aggregates of ca. 60 nm diameter was confirmed by Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Disruption of the aggregates in the presence of guanosine derivatives resulted in a ratiometric signal with apparent association constants in the order of 105 M-1 and high sensitivity (around 63% signal change) which are, to the best of our knowledge, in line with the highest values recorded for nucleotide sensors based on hydrogen bonding and capable of working in water. Computational studies indicate the presence of additional hydrogen bonding interactions that account for the strong binding of the Au(i) complex to phosphorylated guanosine nucleotides."

  "description": "Quantum collapse as reduction from a continuum of conditional amplitudes in an entangled state to a single actualized amplitude in the collapsed stateAccording to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics a measurement leads to the collapse of a quantum system. A unified description of a quantum system before and after measurement of the position r1a and the spin s1a of one of its electrons is proposed based on the conditional amplitude and its density. Quantum collapse is described as reduction from continuum of the conditional amplitudes {\u03c6(x2,\u22ef,xN|r1h,s1h)} in an initial quantum state to the single actualized amplitude \u03c6(x2, \u22ef,xN|r1a,s1a) in a collapsed state. The latter state contains the information about quantum entanglement, the extraction of which with fragment entanglement measure is demonstrated for the realistic valence bond models of the dissociating dihydrogen and ethylene molecules."

  "description": "Mutagenesis-Based Characterization and Improvement of a Novel Inclusion Body TagWhereas, bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) for long were regarded as undesirable aggregates emerging during recombinant protein production, they currently receive attention as promising nanoparticulate biomaterials with diverse applications in biotechnology and biomedicine. We previously identified ssTorA, a signal sequence that normally directs protein export via the Tat pathway in E. coli, as a tag that induces the accumulation of fused proteins into IBs under overexpression conditions. Here, we used targeted mutagenesis to identify features and motifs being either critical or dispensable for IB formation. We found that IB formation is neither related to the function of ssTorA as a Tat-signal sequence nor is it a general feature of this family of signal sequences. IB formation was inhibited by co-overexpression of ssTorA binding chaperones TorD and DnaK and by amino acid substitutions that affect the propensity of ssTorA to form an \u03b1-helix. Systematic deletion experiments identified a minimal region of ssTorA required for IB formation in the center of the signal sequence. Unbiased genetic screening of a library of randomly mutagenized ssTorA sequences for reduced aggregation properties allowed us to pinpoint residues that are critical to sustain insoluble expression. Together, the data point to possible mechanisms for the aggregation of ssTorA fusions. Additionally, they led to the design of a tag with superior IB-formation properties compared to the original ssTorA sequence."

  "description": "Understanding chemical reactivity using the activation strain modelUnderstanding chemical reactivity through the use of state-of-the-art computational techniques enables chemists to both predict reactivity and rationally design novel reactions. This protocol aims to provide chemists with the tools to implement a powerful and robust method for analyzing and understanding any chemical reaction using PyFrag 2019. The approach is based on the so-called activation strain model (ASM) of reactivity, which relates the relative energy of a molecular system to the sum of the energies required to distort the reactants into the geometries required to react plus the strength of their mutual interactions. Other available methods analyze only a stationary point on the potential energy surface, but our methodology analyzes the change in energy along a reaction coordinate. The use of this methodology has been proven to be critical to the understanding of reactions, spanning the realms of the inorganic and organic, as well as the supramolecular and biochemical, fields. This protocol provides step-by-step instructions\u2014starting from the optimization of the stationary points and extending through calculation of the potential energy surface and analysis of the trend-decisive energy terms\u2014that can serve as a guide for carrying out the analysis of any given reaction of interest within hours to days, depending on the size of the molecular system."

  "description": "Antivenom neutralization of coagulopathic snake venom toxins assessed by bioactivity profiling using nanofractionation analyticsVenomous snakebite is one of the world\u2019s most lethal neglected tropical diseases. Animal-derived antivenoms are the only standardized specific therapies currently available for treating snakebite envenoming, but due to venom variation, often this treatment is not effective in counteracting all clinical symptoms caused by the multitude of injected toxins. In this study, the coagulopathic toxicities of venoms from the medically relevant snake species Bothrops asper, Calloselasma rhodostoma, Deinagkistrodon acutus, Daboia russelii, Echis carinatus and Echis ocellatus were assessed. The venoms were separated by liquid chromatography (LC) followed by nanofractionation and parallel mass spectrometry (MS). A recently developed high-throughput coagulation assay was employed to assess both the pro- and anticoagulant activity of separated venom toxins. The neutralization capacity of antivenoms on separated venom components was assessed and the coagulopathic venom peptides and enzymes that were either neutralized or remained active in the presence of antivenom were identified by correlating bioassay results with the MS data and with off-line generated proteomics data. The results showed that most snake venoms analyzed contained both procoagulants and anticoagulants. Most anticoagulants were identified as phospholipases A2s (PLA2s) and most procoagulants correlated with snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and serine proteases (SVSPs). This information can be used to better understand antivenom neutralization and can aid in the development of next-generation antivenom treatments."

  "description": "Snake Venom Gland OrganoidsWnt dependency and Lgr5 expression define multiple mammalian epithelial stem cell types. Under defined growth factor conditions, such adult stem cells (ASCs) grow as 3D organoids that recapitulate essential features of the pertinent epithelium. Here, we establish long-term expanding venom gland organoids from several snake species. The newly assembled transcriptome of the Cape coral snake reveals that organoids express high levels of toxin transcripts. Single-cell RNA sequencing of both organoids and primary tissue identifies distinct venom-expressing cell types as well as proliferative cells expressing homologs of known mammalian stem cell markers. A hard-wired regional heterogeneity in the expression of individual venom components is maintained in organoid cultures. Harvested venom peptides reflect crude venom composition and display biological activity. This study extends organoid technology to reptilian tissues and describes an experimentally tractable model system representing the snake venom gland."

  "description": "GUI Implementation of VCDtools, A Program to Analyze Computed Vibrational Circular Dichroism SpectraAs computing power increases, vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) calculations on molecules of larger sizes and complexities become possible. At the same time, the spectra resulting from these computations become increasingly more cumbersome to analyze. Here, we describe the GUI implementation into the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) software package of VCDtools, a toolbox that provides a user-friendly means to analyze VCD spectra. Key features are the use of the generalized coupled oscillator analysis methods, as well as an easy visualization of the atomic electric and magnetic transition dipole moments which together provide detailed insight in the origin of the VCD intensity. Using several prototypical examples we demonstrate the functionalities of the program. In particular, we show how the spectra can be analyzed to detect differences between theory and experiment arising from large-amplitude motions or incorrect molecular structures and, most importantly, how the program can be used to prevent incorrect enantiomeric assignments."

  "description": "Science-based entrepreneurship education as a means for university-industry technology transferThis paper explores the potential of university-industry technology transfer through science-based entrepreneurship education (SBEE). The scientific literature focuses mostly on enabling university-industry technology transfer via university-industry collaboration in research, and not so much in (science) education. The paper identifies four strands of relevant literature for further theorizing SBEE principles to research its contribution to industry-technology transfer: 1. Embedding entrepreneurship education in universities; 2. Balancing theory and practice of entrepreneurship education; 3. Cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset through entrepreneurship education; and 4. Creating spin-offs through entrepreneurship education. One of the main theoretical contributions of this paper is, that SBEE is different from regular entrepreneurship education in its need for being firmly embedded in a science, technology and R&D environment, both within and outside the university. This is important in order to give SBEE students the opportunity to gain experience with handling the hurdles for successful university-industry technology transfer. The main empirical finding is that elements in the program, related to for example the balance between teaching entrepreneurship through theory and experiential learning, are not systematically covered. It means that fundamental questions such as: Can entrepreneurship be indeed taught? Which elements of entrepreneurship can be taught through theory, and which ones must be experienced in practice? are currently left unanswered. Systematic coverage of these questions enables a better exploitation of the possibilities that SBEE offers for university-industry technology transfer."

  "description": "Transthyretin-binding activity of complex mixtures representing the composition of thyroid-hormone disrupting contaminants in house dust and human serumBACKGROUND: House dust contains many organic contaminants that can compete with the thyroid hormone (TH) thyroxine (T4) for binding to trans-thyretin (TTR). How these contaminants work together at levels found in humans and how displacement from TTR in vitro relates to in vivo T4-TTR binding is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Our aims were to determine the TTR-binding potency for contaminant mixtures as found in house dust, maternal serum, and infant se-rum; to study whether the TTR-binding potency of the mixtures follows the principle of concentration addition; and to extrapolate the in vitro TTR-binding potency to in vivo inhibition levels of T4-TTR binding in maternal and infant serum. METHODS: Twenty-five contaminants were tested for their in vitro capacity to compete for TTR-binding with a fluorescent FITC-T4 probe. Three mixtures were reconstituted proportionally to median concentrations for these chemicals in house dust, maternal serum, or infant serum from Nordic countries. Measured concentration\u2013response curves were compared with concentration\u2013response curves predicted by concentration addition. For each reconstituted serum mixture, its inhibitor\u2013TTR dissociation constant (Ki) was used to estimate inhibition levels of T4-TTR binding in human blood. RESULTS: The TTR-binding potency of the mixtures was well predicted by concentration addition. The \u223c 20% inhibition in FITC-T4 binding observed for the mixtures reflecting median concentrations in maternal and infant serum was extrapolated to 1.3% inhibition of T4-TTR binding in maternal and 1.5% in infant blood. For nontested mixtures reflecting high-end serum concentrations, these estimates were 6.2% and 4.9%, respectively. DISCUSSION: The relatively low estimated inhibition levels at median exposure levels may explain why no relationship between exposure to TTR-binding compounds and circulating T4 levels in humans has been reported, so far. We hypothesize, however, that 1.3% inhibition of T4-TTR binding may ultimately be decisive for reaching a status of maternal hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia associated with impaired neurodevelopment in children."

As demonstrated by systematic benchmarks, dimerization and isomerization energies obtained with our code using STO basis sets of triple-\u03b6-quality show mean absolute deviations from Gaussian type orbital, canonical, basis set limit extrapolated, global density fitting (DF)-MP2 results of less than 1 kcal/mol. Furthermore, we introduce a quadratic scaling atomic orbital based spin-opposite-scaled (SOS)-MP2 approach with a very small prefactor. Due to a worst-case scaling of [Formula: see text], our implementation is very fast already for small systems and shows an exceptionally early crossover to canonical SOS-PARI-MP2. We report computational wall time results for linear as well as for realistic three-dimensional molecules and show that triple-\u03b6 quality calculations on molecules of several hundreds of atoms are only a matter of a few hours on a single compute node, the bottleneck of the computations being the SCF rather than the post-SCF energy correction."

  "description": "Glycine Receptor Complex Analysis Using Immunoprecipitation-Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis-Mass SpectrometryThe pentameric glycine receptor (GlyR), comprising the \u03b11 and \u03b2 subunits, is a major inhibitory ionotropic receptor in brainstem and spinal cord. GlyRs interact with gephyrin (GPHN), a scaffold protein that anchors the GlyR in the plasma membrane and enables it to form clusters in glycinergic postsynapses. Using an interaction proteomics approach, evidence of the ArfGEFs IQ motif and Sec7 domain 3 (IQSEC3) and IQ motif and Sec7 domain 2 (IQSEC2) as two novel synaptic proteins interacting with GlyR complexes is provided. When the affinity-isolated GlyR complexes are fractionated by blue native gel electrophoresis and characterized by mass spectrometry, GlyR \u03b11\u03b2-GPHN appears as the most abundant complex with a molecular weight of \u22481 MDa, and GlyR \u03b11\u03b2-GPHN-IQSEC3 as a minor protein complex of \u22481.2 MDa. A third GlyR \u03b11\u03b2-GPHN-IQSEC2 complex exists at the lowest amount with a mass similar to the IQSEC3 containing complex. Using yeast two-hybrid it is demonstrated that IQSEC3 interacts with the GlyR complex by binding to the GPHN G domain at the N-terminal of the IQSEC3 IQ-like domain. The data provide direct evidence of the interaction of IQSEC3 with GlyR-GPHN complexes, underscoring a potential role of these ArfGEFs in the function of glycinergic synapses."

  "description": "Evaluation of the Alicyclic Gauche Effect in 2-Fluorocyclohexanone Analogs: a Combined NMR and DFT StudyHerein, we have investigated the effect of an endocyclic group (forming the N\u2013C\u2013C\u2013F fragment) on the conformational preferences of 2-fluorocyclohexanone analogs. A combined approach of nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional theory calculations was employed to assess the conformational equilibrium in several media. In turn, natural bond orbital analysis and the conformational behavior of other 2-halocyclohexanone analogs were used to get more insights about the intramolecular interactions governing the conformer stabilities. Our results reveal that any stabilization from interactions featured in the gauche effect is overcome by a short-range interaction of the fluorine substituent with the carbonyl group. Consequently, the gauche effect in heterocyclic compounds is not as stabilizing as in their acyclic counterparts. Only the electrostatic gauche effect takes place even in polar solvents owing to an attraction between the axial fluorine and an endocyclic quaternary ammonium group."

  "description": "Adapting free energy perturbation simulations for large macrocyclic ligands: how to dissect contributions from direct binding and free ligand flexibilityLarge and flexible ligands gain increasing interest in the development of bioactive agents. They challenge the applicability of computational ligand optimization strategies originally developed for small molecules. Free energy perturbation (FEP) is often used for predicting binding affinities of small molecule ligands, however, its use for more complex ligands remains limited. Herein, we report the structure-based design of peptide macrocycles targeting the protein binding site of human adaptor protein 14-3-3. We observe a surprisingly strong dependency of binding affinities on relatively small variations in substituent size. FEP was performed to rationalize observed trends. To account for insufficient convergence of FEP, restrained calculations were performed and complemented with extensive REST MD simulations of the free ligands. These calculations revealed that changes in affinity originate both from altered direct interactions and conformational changes of the free ligand. In addition, MD simulations provided the basis to rationalize unexpected trends in ligand lipophilicity. We also verified the anticipated interaction site and binding mode for one of the high affinity ligands by X-ray crystallography. The introduced fully-atomistic simulation protocol can be used to rationalize the development of structurally complex ligands which will support future ligand maturation efforts."

  "description": "Ambident Nucleophilic Substitution: Understanding Non-HSAB Behavior through Activation Strain and Conceptual DFT AnalysesThe ability to understand and predict ambident reactivity is key to the rational design of organic syntheses. An approach to understand trends in ambident reactivity is the hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB) principle. The recent controversy over the general validity of this principle prompted us to investigate the competing gas-phase SN2 reaction channels of archetypal ambident nucleophiles CN\u2212, OCN\u2212, and SCN\u2212 with CH3Cl (SN2@C) and SiH3Cl (SN2@Si), using DFT calculations. Our combined analyses highlight the inability of the HSAB principle to correctly predict the reactivity trends of these simple, model reactions. Instead, we have successfully traced reactivity trends to the canonical orbital-interaction mechanism and the resulting nucleophile\u2013substrate interaction energy. The HOMO\u2013LUMO orbital interactions set the trend in both SN2@C and SN2@Si reactions. We provide simple rules for predicting the ambident reactivity of nucleophiles based on our Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analysis."

Computed activation energies systematically decrease as the strength of the LA increases along the series I2<SnCl4<TiCl4<ZnCl2<BF3<AlCl3. Emerging from our activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital bonding analysis was an unprecedented finding, namely that the LAs accelerate the Diels\u2013Alder reaction by a diminished Pauli repulsion between the \u03c0-electron systems of the diene and dienophile.

  "description": "Pre-exascale accelerated application development: The ORNL Summit experienceHigh-performance computing (HPC) increasingly relies on heterogeneous architectures to achieve higher performance. In the Oak Ridge Leadership Facility (OLCF), Oak Ridge, TN, USA, this trend continues as its latest supercomputer, Summit, entered production in early 2019. The combination of IBM POWER9 CPU and NVIDIA V100 GPU, along with a fast NVLink2 interconnect and other latest technologies, pushes system performance to a new height and breaks the exascale barrier by certain measures. Due to Summit's powerful GPUs and much higher GPU-CPU ratio, offloading to accelerators becomes a requirement for any application, which intends to effectively use the system. To facilitate navigating a complex landscape of competing heterogeneous architectures, a collection of applications from a wide spectrum of scientific domains is selected for early adoption on Summit. In this article, the experience and lessons learned are summarized, in the hope of providing useful guidance to address new programming challenges, such as scalability, performance portability, and software maintainability, for future application development efforts on heterogeneous HPC systems."

  "description": "A Modified Arrhenius Approach to Thermodynamically Study Regioselectivity in Cytochrome P450-Catalyzed Substrate ConversionThe regio- (and stereo-)selectivity and specific activity of cytochrome P450s are determined by the accessibility of potential sites of metabolism (SOMs) of the bound substrate relative to the heme, and the activation barrier of the regioselective oxidation reaction(s). The accessibility of potential SOMs depends on the relative binding free energy (\u0394\u0394Gbind) of the catalytically active substrate-binding poses, and the probability of the substrate to adopt a transition-state geometry. An established experimental method to measure activation energies of enzymatic reactions is the analysis of reaction rate constants at different temperatures and the construction of Arrhenius plots. This is a challenge for multistep P450-catalyzed processes that involve redox partners. We introduce a modified Arrhenius approach to overcome the limitations in studying P450 selectivity, which can be applied in multiproduct enzyme catalysis. Our approach gives combined information on relative activation energies, \u0394\u0394Gbind values, and collision entropies, yielding direct insight into the basis of selectivity in substrate conversion."

  "description": "A proteome-integrated, carbon source dependent genetic regulatory network in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeIntegrated regulatory networks can be powerful tools to examine and test properties of cellular systems, such as modelling environmental effects on the molecular bioeconomy, where protein levels are altered in response to changes in growth conditions. Although extensive regulatory pathways and protein interaction data sets exist which represent such networks, few have formally considered quantitative proteomics data to validate and extend them. We generate and consider such data here using a label-free proteomics strategy to quantify alterations in protein abundance for S. cerevisiae when grown on minimal media using glucose, galactose, maltose and trehalose as sole carbon sources. Using a high quality-controlled subset of proteins observed to be differentially abundant, we constructed a proteome-informed network, comprising 1850 transcription factor interactions and 37 chaperone interactions, which defines the major changes in the cellular proteome when growing under different carbon sources. Analysis of the differentially abundant proteins involved in the regulatory network pointed to their significant roles in specific metabolic pathways and function, including glucose homeostasis, amino acid biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolic process. We noted strong statistical enrichment in the differentially abundant proteome of targets of known transcription factors associated with stress responses and altered carbon metabolism. This shows how such integrated analysis can lend further experimental support to annotated regulatory interactions, since the proteomic changes capture both magnitude and direction of gene expression change at the level of the affected proteins. Overall this study highlights the power of quantitative proteomics to help define regulatory systems pertinent to environmental conditions."

  "description": "Microdroplet screening and selection for improved microbial production of extracellular compoundsMicroorganisms produce extracellular compounds that affect the final product quality in fermentation processes. Selection of overproducing mutants requires coupling of the extracellular product to the producer genotype, which can be achieved by single-cell compartmentalization. Emulsions contain up to billions of microdroplets/mL which significantly increases the screening throughput compared to microtiter-plate-based selections. Factors affecting the success of screening in microdroplets include the nature of the producing organism (robust, no invasive growth), the product (not soluble in oil) and the product assay (preferably fluorescence based). Together these factors determine the required microdroplet production technique and sorting set-up. Because microdroplets allow relatively inexpensive ultrahigh-throughput screening, they are likely to become a standard tool in the strain selection toolbox of the fermentation industry."

  "description": "Vision of a near future: Bridging the human health\u2013environment divide. Toward an integrated strategy to understand mechanisms across species for chemical safety assessmentThere is a growing recognition that application of mechanistic approaches to understand cross-species shared molecular targets and pathway conservation in the context of hazard characterization, provide significant opportunities in risk assessment (RA) for both human health and environmental safety. Specifically, it has been recognized that a more comprehensive and reliable understanding of similarities and differences in biological pathways across a variety of species will better enable cross-species extrapolation of potential adverse toxicological effects. Ultimately, this would also advance the generation and use of mechanistic data for both human health and environmental RA. A workshop brought together representatives from industry, academia and government to discuss how to improve the use of existing data, and to generate new NAMs data to derive better mechanistic understanding between humans and environmentally-relevant species, ultimately resulting in holistic chemical safety decisions. Thanks to a thorough dialogue among all participants, key challenges, current gaps and research needs were identified, and potential solutions proposed. This discussion highlighted the common objective to progress toward more predictive, mechanistically based, data-driven and animal-free chemical safety assessments. Overall, the participants recognized that there is no single approach which would provide all the answers for bridging the gap between mechanism-based human health and environmental RA, but acknowledged we now have the incentive, tools and data availability to address this concept, maximizing the potential for improvements in both human health and environmental RA."

  "description": "The common message of constraint-based optimization approaches: overflow metabolism is caused by two growth-limiting constraintsLiving cells can express different metabolic pathways that support growth. The criteria that determine which pathways are selected in which environment remain unclear. One recurrent selection is overflow metabolism: the simultaneous usage of an ATP-efficient and -inefficient pathway, shown for example in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and cancer cells. Many models, based on different assumptions, can reproduce this observation. Therefore, they provide no conclusive evidence which mechanism is causing overflow metabolism. We compare the mathematical structure of these models. Although ranging from flux balance analyses to self-fabricating metabolism and expression models, we can rewrite all models into one standard form. We conclude that all models predict overflow metabolism when two, model-specific, growth-limiting constraints are hit. This is consistent with recent theory. Thus, identifying these two constraints is essential for understanding overflow metabolism. We list all imposed constraints by these models, so that they can hopefully be tested in future experiments."

  "description": "Hydrogen-bonded rosettes of aminotriazines for selective-ion recognitionIon recognition is still an emerging topic in supramolecular chemistry and has aroused great attention in the last few years. In this work, we have examined the assemblies of selected hexameric rosettes of melamine and ammeline and their capacities to host halide and alkali ions in the gas phase and in water. Using relativistic dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D), we first studied the stability and the effect of introducing monovalent anions (Cl\u2212, Br\u2212, and I\u2212) and cations (Na+, K+, and Rb+) in the center of the rosette\u2019s cavity. Finally, we explored the interactions in two stacked rosettes with an interlayer ion. Our computations reveal that amine-substituted triazines are promising candidates for anion and cation recognition either in self-assembled monolayers or pillar array structures. The anion recognition process is governed by both the electrostatic and charge-transfer (donor\u2212acceptor) interactions, while the cation recognition is governed by electrostatic and polarization. In addition, melamine and ammeline could constitute a potent mixture for dual-ion recognition strategies."

  "description": "Optimizing employee creativity in the digital era: Uncovering the interactional effects of abilities, motivations, and opportunitiesAn increasing digitalization in all aspects of life and work reshapes traditional assumptions about human creativity. Both scholars and practitioners raise many questions with regards to how to stimulate employee creativity in the digital work context. While there are many studies that examine predictors of employee creativity, little effort has been made thus far to synthesize these findings in way that would provide meaningful guidance to organizations and to provide bases for future research. With this paper we aim to contribute to filling this gap. We systematically review empirical studies on predictors of employee creativity published in the past 30 years and organize findings following an established human resources management framework: Ability\u2013Motivation\u2013Opportunity (AMO) theory. This organizing framework enables us to clearly depict how contextual factors (a) separately and (b) jointly influence individual employee creativity. Specifically, it enables us to depict two possible models\u2014combination and multiplicative models\u2014through which contextual factors interact with individual factors in predicting employee creativity. Through synthesizing evidence for each of the models, we demonstrate to scholars and practitioners what is known about the interactional effects of contextual and personal factors on employee creativity, and what still needs to be studied if we are to take the field of research on creativity in the digital era forward."

Adequate flow-confinement measures are necessary. Here, the use of permeability differences across different compartments of spatial two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) LC devices as a method to guide fluid flow and reduce analyte loss during the first, second- and third-dimension development was investigated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. In case of 2DLC devices, it was shown that porous barriers with a permeability on the order of 10\u221212 m2 suffice to keep the total sample spillage from an open 1D channel under 1%. In case of 3DLC devices, it was shown that flow confinement could be achieved using an open 1D channel in combination with a highly-permeable monolith (permeability on the order of 10\u221212 m2) in the second-dimension (2D) and a less permeable packing with a permeability on the order of 10\u221215 m2 (e.g. 1 \u03bcm particles) in the third-dimension (3D). Additionally, the impact of the 3D flow-distributor has been studied and a novel design, capable of limiting the spillage to the other dimensions to the absolute minimum, is proposed."

Linear interaction energy (LIE) is an efficient in silico method for \u0394Gbind computation. LIE models can be trained and used to directly calculate binding affinities from interaction energies involving ligands in the bound and unbound states only, and LIE can be combined with statistical weighting to calculate \u0394Gbind for flexible proteins that may bind their ligands in multiple orientations. Here, we investigate if LIE predictions can be effectively improved by explicitly including the entropy of (de)solvation into our free-energy calculations. For that purpose, we combine LIE calculations for the protein-ligand-bound state with explicit free-energy perturbation to rigorously compute the unbound ligand's solvation free energy. We show that for 28 Cytochrome P450 2A6 (CYP2A6) ligands, coupling LIE with alchemical solvation free-energy calculation helps to improve obtained correlation between computed and reference (experimental) binding data."

  "description": "Distortion-Controlled Redshift of Organic Dye MoleculesIt is shown, quantum chemically, how structural distortion of an aromatic dye molecule can be leveraged to rationally tune its optoelectronic properties. By using a quantitative Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital (KS-MO) approach, in combination with time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), the influence of various structural and electronic tuning parameters on the HOMO\u2013LUMO gap of a benzenoid model dye have been investigated. These parameters include 1) out-of-plane bending of the aromatic core, 2) bending of the bridge with respect to the core, 3) the nature of the bridge itself, and 4) \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking. The study reveals the coupling of multiple structural distortions as a function of bridge length and number of bridges in benzene to be chiefly responsible for a decreased HOMO\u2013LUMO gap, and consequently, red-shifting of the absorption wavelength associated with the lowest singlet excitation (\u03bb\u2248560 nm) in the model cyclophane systems. These physical insights together with a rational approach for tuning the oscillator strength were leveraged for the proof-of-concept design of an intense near-infrared (NIR) absorbing cyclophane dye at \u03bb=785 nm. This design may contribute to a new class of distortion-controlled NIR absorbing organic dye molecules."

  "description": "A Chimeric EccB-MycP Fusion Protein is Functional and a Stable Component of the ESX-5 Type VII Secretion System Membrane ComplexThe mycosin protease (MycP) is widely conserved in type VII secretion (T7S) systems throughout Actinobacteria. Within the T7S systems of mycobacteria, also known as the ESX systems, MycP is essential for secretion, which is probably linked to its stabilizing effect on the ESX membrane complex. However, it is unknown how this is mediated, as MycP is not a stable component of this complex. In this study, we set out to create a chimeric fusion protein of EccB5 and MycP5, based on a chimeric gene of eccB and mycP in the T7S locus of Bifidobacterium dentium. We show that this fusion protein is functional and capable of complementing ESX-5 secretion in both an eccB5 and a mycP5 knockout in Mycobacterium marinum. To study the ESX complex containing this fusion protein in more detail, we replaced the original eccB5 and mycP5 of the Mycobacterium xenopi esx-5 locus, reconstituted in Mycobacterium smegmatis, with the chimeric gene. The EccB5-MycP5 fusion construct also restored ESX-5 secretion under these double knockout conditions. Subsequent protein pulldowns on the central complex component EccC5 showed that under these conditions, the EccB5-MycP5 fusion was specifically copurified and a stable component of the ESX-5 complex. Based on our results, we can conclude that MycP5 carries out its essential function in secretion in close proximity to EccB5, indicating that EccB5 is the direct interaction partner of MycP5."

  "description": "Complex Stability and an Irrevertible Transition Reverted by Peptide and Fibroblasts in a Dynamic Model of Innate ImmunityWe here apply a control analysis and various types of stability analysis to an in silico model of innate immunity that addresses the management of inflammation by a therapeutic peptide. Motivation is the observation, both in silico and in experiments, that this therapy is not robust. Our modeling results demonstrate how (1) the biological phenomena of acute and chronic modes of inflammation may reflect an inherently complex bistability with an irrevertible flip between the two modes, (2) the chronic mode of the model has stable, sometimes unique, steady states, while its acute-mode steady states are stable but not unique, (3) as witnessed by TNF levels, acute inflammation is controlled by multiple processes, whereas its chronic-mode inflammation is only controlled by TNF synthesis and washout, (4) only when the antigen load is close to the acute mode's flipping point, many processes impact very strongly on cells and cytokines, (5) there is no antigen exposure level below which reduction of the antigen load alone initiates a flip back to the acute mode, and (6) adding healthy fibroblasts makes the transition from acute to chronic inflammation revertible, although (7) there is a window of antigen load where such a therapy cannot be effective. This suggests that triple therapies may be essential to overcome chronic inflammation. These may comprise (1) anti-immunoglobulin light chain peptides, (2) a temporarily reduced antigen load, and (3a) fibroblast repopulation or (3b) stem cell strategies."

Because allylation can occur at either the N1 or N2 position of the 1,2,3-benzotriazole, the complete Gibbs free energy profiles for both pathways were computed. A kinetic preference emerged for the experimentally observed N1 allylation with the JoSPOphos ligand, whereas N2 allylation was favored with DPEphos. Analysis of the regiodetermining oxidative addition step by using the activation strain model in conjunction with a matching energy decomposition analysis has revealed that the unprecedented N2 reaction regioselectivity is dictated by the strength of the electrostatic interactions between the 1,2,3-benzotriazole and the rhodium catalyst. The nature of the electrostatic interaction was rationalized by analysis of the electrostatic potential maps and Hirshfeld charges: a stabilizing electrostatic interaction was found between the key atoms involved in the oxidative addition for the N2 pathway, analogous interactions are weaker in the N1 case."

  "description": "A combined experimental and modelling approach for the Weimberg pathway optimisationThe oxidative Weimberg pathway for the five-step pentose degradation to \u03b1-ketoglutarate is a key route for sustainable bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to added-value products and biofuels. The oxidative pathway from Caulobacter crescentus has been employed in in-vivo metabolic engineering with intact cells and in in-vitro enzyme cascades. The performance of such engineering approaches is often hampered by systems complexity, caused by non-linear kinetics and allosteric regulatory mechanisms. Here we report an iterative approach to construct and validate a quantitative model for the Weimberg pathway. Two sensitive points in pathway performance have been identified as follows: (1) product inhibition of the dehydrogenases (particularly in the absence of an efficient NAD+ recycling mechanism) and (2) balancing the activities of the dehydratases. The resulting model is utilized to design enzyme cascades for optimized conversion and to analyse pathway performance in C. cresensus cell-free extracts."

Lactobacillus species have been shown to reduce aflatoxin contamination during the process of food fermentation. Twenty-three Lactobacillus strains were isolated from fecal samples obtained from a cohort of rural Ugandan children at the age of 54 to 60 months, typed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and characterized in terms of their ability to bind aflatoxin B1 in vitro. Evidence for chronic exposure of these children to aflatoxin B1 in the study area was obtained by analysis of local foods (maize flour and peanuts), followed by the identification of the breakdown product aflatoxin M1 in their urine samples. Surprisingly, Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota of 140 children from the same cohort at 24 and 36 months showed the highest positive correlation coefficient with stunting among all bacterial genera identified in the stool samples. This correlation was interpreted to be associated with dietary changes from breastfeeding to plant-based solid foods that pose an additional risk for aflatoxin contamination, on one hand, and lead to increased intake of Lactobacillus species on the other."

We describe a new hot loop mimicking modality, termed PepNats, in which natural product (NP)-inspired structures are incorporated as conformation-determining and -restricting structural elements into macrocyclic hot loop-derived peptides. Macrocyclic PepNats representing hot loops of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and human agouti-related protein (AGRP) were synthesized on solid support employing macrocyclization by imine formation and subsequent stereoselective 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition as key steps. PepNats derived from the iNOS DINNN hot loop and the AGRP RFF hot spot sequence yielded novel and potent ligands of the SPRY domain-containing SOCS box protein 2 (SPSB2) that binds to iNOS, and selective ligands for AGRP-binding melanocortin (MC) receptors. NP-inspired fragment absolute configuration determines the conformation of the peptide part responsible for binding. These results demonstrate that combination of NP-inspired scaffolds with peptidic epitopes enables identification of novel hot loop mimics with conformationally constrained and biologically relevant structure."

  "description": "Probing Protein Denaturation during Size-Exclusion Chromatography Using Native Mass SpectrometrySize-exclusion chromatography employing aqueous mobile phases with volatile salts at neutral pH combined with electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (SEC-ESI-MS) is a useful tool to study proteins in their native state. However, whether the applied eluent conditions actually prevent protein-stationary phase interactions, and/or protein denaturation, often is not assessed. In this study, the effects of volatile mobile phase additives on SEC retention and ESI of proteins were thoroughly investigated. Myoglobin was used as the main model protein, and eluents of varying ionic strength and pH were applied. The degree of interaction between protein and stationary phase was evaluated by calculating the SEC distribution coefficient. Protein-ion charge state distributions obtained during offline and online native ESI-MS were used to monitor alterations in protein structure. Interestingly, most of the supposedly mild eluent compositions induced nonideal SEC behavior and/or protein unfolding. SEC experiments revealed that the nature, ionic strength, and pH of the eluent affected protein retention. Protein-stationary phase interactions were effectively avoided using ammonium acetate at ionic strengths above 0.1 M. Direct-infusion ESI-MS showed that the tested volatile eluent salts seem to follow the Hofmeister series: no denaturation was induced using ammonium acetate (kosmotropic), whereas ammonium formate and bicarbonate (both chaotropic) caused structural changes. Using a mobile phase of 0.2 M ammonium acetate (pH 6.9), several proteins (i.e., myoglobin, carbonic anhydrase, and cytochrome c) could be analyzed by SEC-ESI-MS using different column chemistries without compromising their native state. Overall, with SEC-ESI-MS, the effect of nonspecific interactions between protein and stationary phase on the protein structure can be studied, even revealing gradual structural differences along a peak."

  "description": "An Improved ATP FRET Sensor for Yeast Shows Heterogeneity during Nutrient TransitionsAdenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) is the main free energy carrier in metabolism. In budding yeast, shifts to glucose-rich conditions cause dynamic changes in ATP levels, but it is unclear how heterogeneous these dynamics are at a single-cell level. Furthermore, pH also changes and affects readout of fluorescence-based biosensors for single-cell measurements. To measure ATP changes reliably in single yeast cells, we developed yAT1.03, an adapted version of the AT1.03 ATP biosensor, that is pH-insensitive. We show that pregrowth conditions largely affect ATP dynamics during transitions. Moreover, single-cell analyses showed a large variety in ATP responses, which implies large differences of glycolytic startup between individual cells. We found three clusters of dynamic responses, and we show that a small subpopulation of wild-type cells reached an imbalanced state during glycolytic startup, characterized by low ATP levels. These results confirm the need for new tools to study dynamic responses of individual cells in dynamic environments."

  "description": "How Alkali Cations Catalyze Aromatic Diels-Alder ReactionsWe have quantum chemically studied alkali cation-catalyzed aromatic Diels-Alder reactions between benzene and acetylene forming barrelene using relativistic, dispersion-corrected density functional theory. The alkali cation-catalyzed aromatic Diels-Alder reactions are accelerated by up to 5 orders of magnitude relative to the uncatalyzed reaction and the reaction barrier increases along the series Li+ < Na+ < K+ < Rb+ < Cs+ < none. Our detailed activation strain and molecular-orbital bonding analyses reveal that the alkali cations lower the aromatic Diels-Alder reaction barrier by reducing the Pauli repulsion between the closed-shell filled orbitals of the dienophile and the aromatic diene. We argue that such Pauli mechanism behind Lewis-acid catalysis is a more general phenomenon. Also, our results may be of direct importance for a more complete understanding of the network of competing mechanisms towards the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in an astrochemical context."

Viper snake venoms (family Viperidae) generally contain a high proportion of proteases which can cause devastating effects such as hemorrhage, coagulopathy, edema, necrosis, and severe pain, in envenomed victims. In this study, analytical techniques were combined with enzymatic assays to develop a novel method for the detection of snake venom protease activity by using rhodamine-110-peptide substrate. In the so called at-line nanofractionation set up, crude venoms were first separated with reversed phase liquid chromatography, after which fractions were collected onto 384-well plates. Protease activity assays were then performed in the 384-well plates and bioassay chromatograms were constructed revealing protease activity. Parallel obtained UV absorbance, MS and proteomics data from a previous study facilitated toxin identification. The application of the rhodamine-110-peptide substrate assay showed significantly greater sensitivity compared to prior assays using casein-FITC as the substrate. Moreover, cross referencing UV and MS data and resulted in the detection of a number of tentative proteases suspected to exhibit protease activity, including snake venom serine proteases from Calloselasma rhodostoma and Daboia russelli venom and a snake venom metalloproteinase from the venom of Echis ocellatus. Our data demonstrate that his methodology can be a useful tool for selectively identifying snake venom proteases, and can be applied to provide a better understanding of protease-induced pathologies and the development of novel therapeutics for treating snakebite."

Histology slides of four periprosthetic capsules from different implant types were obtained after explantation, as well as an enlarged axillary lymph node from a patient with a ruptured implant. SRS images coregistered with bright-field images revealed the distribution and quantity of silicone material in the tissue. Fast and high-resolution imaging of histology slides with molecular specificity using SRS provides an opportunity to investigate the role of silicone debris in the pathophysiology of implant-linked diseases."

  "description": "Profiling of a high mannose-type N-glycosylated lipase using hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometryMany industrial enzymes exhibit macro- and micro-heterogeneity due to co-occurring post-translational modifications. The resulting proteoforms may have different activity and stability and, therefore, the characterization of their distributions is of interest in the development and monitoring of enzyme products. Protein glycosylation may play a critical role as it can influence the expression, physical and biochemical properties of an enzyme. We report the use of hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) to profile intact glycoform distributions of high mannose-type N-glycosylated proteins, using an industrially produced fungal lipase for the food industry as an example. We compared these results with conventional reversed phase LC-MS (RPLC-MS) and sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). HILIC appeared superior in resolving lipase heterogeneity, facilitating mass assignment of N-glycoforms and sequence variants. In order to understand the glycoform selectivity provided by HILIC, fractions from the four main HILIC elution bands for lipase were taken and subjected to SDS-PAGE and bottom-up proteomic analysis. These analyses enabled the identification of the most abundant glycosylation sites present in each fraction and corroborated the capacity of HILIC to separate protein glycoforms based on the number of glycosylation sites occupied. Compared to RPLC-MS, HILIC-MS reducted the sample complexity delivered to the mass spectrometer, facilitating the assignment of the masses of glycoforms and sequence variants as well as increasing the number of glycoforms detected (69 more proteoforms, 177% increase). The HILIC-MS method required relatively short analysis time (<30 min), in which over 100 glycoforms were distinguished. We suggest that HILIC(-MS) can be a valuable tool in characterizing bioengineering processes aimed at steering protein glycoform expression as well as to check the consistency of product batches."

While long-chain CP (LCCP, C>17) levels were below method detection limits (MDLs), short-chain CPs (SCCPs, C10-13) and, for the first time, medium-chain CPs (MCCPs, C14-17) and CPs with a carbon chain length of nine (CP\u2013C9) were found at many sites (88%, 81% and 88%, respectively) across the Australian continent, representing a range of environmental conditions. Applying preliminary sampling rates of the XAD-PAS for CPs, gaseous CP levels in Australian air were <MDL-1.3 and <MDL-1.8 ng/m3 for \u03a3SCCPs and \u03a3MCCPs, respectively, with a significant decreasing trend from more densely to less densely populated areas. Atmospheric median levels in this study (0.37 and 0.47 ng/m3 for SCCPs and MCCPs, respectively) were at the lower end of the median range (0.32\u201310 and 3.0\u20134.2 ng/m3 for SCCPs and MCCPs, respectively) reported for CPs at predominantly urban or industrial sites elsewhere (apart from China and extremely remote sites such as Antarctica). Principal component analysis matched the SCCP and MCCP congener group patterns in samples with those found in commercial mixtures, indicating a prevalence of less chlorinated congener groups in the Australian atmosphere. Information about the Australian production, use and disposal of CPs as well as their levels in other environmental matrices, including humans, is needed for assessing their emissions, behaviour, fate and potential exposure."

  "description": "The carboxy-terminal insert in the Q-loop is needed for functionality of Escherichia coli cytochrome bd-ICytochrome bd, a component of the prokaryotic respiratory chain, is important under physiological stress and during pathogenicity. Electrons from quinol substrates are passed on via heme groups in the CydA subunit and used to reduce molecular oxygen. Close to the quinol binding site, CydA displays a periplasmic hydrophilic loop called Q-loop that is essential for quinol oxidation. In the carboxy-terminal part of this loop, CydA from Escherichia coli and other proteobacteria harbors an insert of ~60 residues with unknown function. In the current work, we demonstrate that growth of the multiple-deletion strain E. coli MB43\u2206cydA (\u2206cydA\u2206cydB\u2206appB\u2206cyoB\u2206nuoB) can be enhanced by transformation with E. coli cytochrome bd-I and we utilize this system for assessment of Q-loop mutants. Deletion of the cytochrome bd-I Q-loop insert abolished MB43\u2206cydA growth recovery. Swapping the cytochrome bd-I Q-loop for the Q-loop from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans or Mycobacterium tuberculosis CydA, which lack the insert, did not enhance the growth of MB43\u2206cydA, whereas swapping for the Q-loop from E. coli cytochrome bd-II recovered growth. Alanine scanning experiments identified the cytochrome bd-I Q-loop insert regions Ile318-Met322, Gln338-Asp342, Tyr353-Leu357, and Thr368-Ile372 as important for enzyme functionality. Those mutants that completely failed to recover growth of MB43\u2206cydA also lacked oxygen consumption activity and heme absorption peaks. Moreover, we were not able to isolate cytochrome bd-I from these inactive mutants.

  "description": "The effect of weathering on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from durable water repellent (DWR) clothingTo assess the effects of weathering on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) from durable water repellent (DWR) clothing, thirteen commercial textile samples were exposed to elevated ultra violet (UV) radiation, humidity, and temperature in an aging device for 300 h, which mimics the lifespan of outdoor clothing. Before and after aging, the textile samples were extracted and analysed for the ionic PFASs (perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA)) and volatile PFASs (fluorotelomer alcohols (FTOHs), acrylates (FTACs) and methacrylates (FTMACs)). Results showed that weathering can have an effect on PFASs used in DWR of outdoor clothing, both on the PFAS profile and on the measured concentrations. In most weathered samples the PFAA concentrations increased by 5- to more than 100-fold, while PFAAs not detected in the original textiles were detected in the weathered samples. DWR chemistries are based on side-chain fluorinated polymers. A possible explanation for the increase in concentration of the PFAAs is hydrolysis of the fluorotelomer based polymers (FTPs), or degradation of the FTOHs, which are used in the manufacturing of the FTPs. The concentrations of volatile PFASs also increased, by a factor up to 20. Suggested explanations are the degradation of the DWR polymers, making non-extractable fluorines extractable, or the transformation or degradation of unknown precursors. Further research is needed to unravel the details of these processes and to determine the transformation routes. This study shows that setting maximum tolerance limits only for a few individual PFASs is not sufficient to control these harmful substances in outdoor clothing."

  "description": "Global interlaboratory assessments of perfluoroalkyl substances under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutantsThe Global Monitoring Plan (GMP) according to article 16 of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) requires that POP laboratories must be capable \u2013 at any time \u2013 to analyse samples for POPs within a variation of \u00b125%. Based on this target error of 25%, a statistical model using z-scores was applied to assess the performance of analytical laboratories for POPs and a number of matrices. Since the second round of these \u2018Bi-ennial Global Interlaboratory Assessment on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)\u2019, carried out in 2012/2013, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been included into the proficiency tests. The third round was carried out in 2016/2017. The test materials included test solutions of PFASs analytical standards, the abiotic matrices sediment, air (extract) and water and the biotic matrices fish, human milk and human plasma. The number of laboratories submitting results for PFASs remained quite stable (IL2 = 27 laboratories; IL3 = 29), but there was broader geographic distribution observed in IL3: in addition to the laboratories from Asia and the Western Europe/other groups, two laboratories from Africa participated, two from Central-Eastern Europe and one from the Latin American/Caribbean region.Considering that PFASs were introduced for the first time in round 2, the results were good to reasonable compared to those of a number of other POPs included in the same study. However, it shall also be mentioned that for some matrices and PFASs, the number of laboratories submitting results was too small and the results too scattered to derive a consensus value. This was especially true for the PFOS precursor compounds and the air matrix. Also, laboratories struggle with the analysis of the branched PFOS isomers.These interlaboratory assessments on PFASs gave promising results and demonstrated the importance of proficiency tests in an international environment to generate trust in laboratory results. The need to participate regularly in such intercomparison assessments is highlighted. The results show the current level of PFAS analysis, which varies by laboratory and by matrix rather than per geographic region."

  "description": "Development and evaluation of a harmonized whole body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for flutamide in rats and its extrapolation to humansBy their definition, inadvertent exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) intervenes with the endocrine signalling system, even at low dose. On the one hand, some EDCs are used as important pharmaceutical drugs that one would not want to dismiss. On the other hand, these pharmaceutical drugs are having off-target effects and increasingly significant exposure to the general population with unwanted health implications. Flutamide, one of the top pharmaceutical products marketed all over the world for the treatment of prostate cancer, is also a pollutant. Its therapeutic action mainly depends on targeting the androgen receptors and inhibiting the androgen action that is essential for growth and survival of prostate tissue. Currently flutamide is of concern with respect to its categorization as an endocrine disruptor. In this work we have developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of flutamide that could serve as a standard tool for its human risk assessment. First we built the model for rat (where many parameters have been measured). The rat PBPK model was extrapolated to human where the re-parameterization involved human-specific physiology, metabolic kinetics derived from in-vitro studies, and the partition coefficient same as the rat model. We have harmonized the model by integrating different sets of in-vitro, in-vivo and physiological data into a PBPK model. Then the model was used to simulate different exposure scenarios and the results were compared against the observed data. Both uncertainty and sensitivity analysis was done. Since this new whole-body PBPK model can predict flutamide concentrations not only in plasma but also in various organs, the model may have clinical applications in efficacy and safety assessment of flutamide. The model can also be used for reverse dosimetry in the context of interpreting the available biomonitoring data to estimate the degree to which the population is currently being exposed, and a tool for the pharmaceutical companies to validate the estimated Permitted Daily Exposure (PDE) for flutamide."

  "description": "Long-term exposure of activated sludge in chemostats leads to changes in microbial communities composition and enhanced biodegradation of 4-chloroaniline and N-methylpiperazineExposure history and adaptation of the inoculum to chemicals have been shown to influence the outcome of ready biodegradability tests. However, there is a lack of information about the mechanisms involved in microbial adaptation and the implication thereof for the tests. In the present study, we investigated the impact of a long-term exposure to N-methylpiperazine (NMP) and 4-chloroaniline (4CA) of an activated sludge microbial community using chemostat systems. The objective was to characterize the influence of adaptation to the chemicals on an enhanced biodegradation testing, following the OECD 310 guideline. Cultures were used to inoculate the enhanced biodegradability tests, in batch, before and after exposure to each chemical independently in chemostat culture. Composition and diversity of the microbial communities were characterised by 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Using freshly sampled activated sludge, NMP was not degraded within the 28 d frame of the test while 4CA was completely eliminated. However, after one month of exposure, the community exposed to NMP was adapted and could completely degrade it. This result was in complete contrast with that from the culture exposed for 3 months to 4CA. Long term incubation in the chemostat system led to a progressive loss of the initial biodegradation capacity of the community, as a consequence of the loss of key degrading microorganisms. This study highlights the potential of chemostat systems to induce adaptation to a specific chemical, ultimately resulting in its biodegradation. At the same time, one should be critical of these observations as the dynamics of a microbial community are difficult to maintain in chemostat, as the loss of 4CA biodegradation capacity demonstrates."

  "description": "A European proposal for quality control and quality assurance of tandem mass spectral librariesBackground: High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is being used increasingly in the context of suspect and non-targeted screening for the identification of bioorganic molecules. There is correspondingly increasing awareness that higher confidence identification will require a systematic, group effort to increase the fraction of compounds with tandem mass spectra available in central, publicly available resources. While typical suspect screening efforts will only result in tentative annotations with a moderate level of confidence, library spectral matches will yield higher confidence or even full confirmation of the identity if the reference standards are available. Results: This article first explores representative percent coverage of measured tandem mass spectra in selected major environmental suspect databases of interest in the context of human biomonitoring, demonstrating the current extensive gap between the number of potential substances of interest (up to hundreds of thousands) and measured spectra (0.57\u20133.6% of the total chemicals have spectral information available). Furthermore, certain datasets are benchmarked, based on previous efforts, to show the extent to which acquired experimental data were comparable between laboratories, even with HRMS instruments based on different technologies (i.e., quadrupole\u2013quadrupole-time of flight versus ion trap/quadrupole-Orbitrap). Instruments and settings that are less comparable are also revealed, primarily linear ion trap instruments, which show distinctly lower comparability. Conclusions: Based on these efforts, harmonization guidelines for the acquisition and processing of tandem mass spectrometry data are proposed to enable European (and ideally worldwide) laboratories to contribute to common resources, without requiring extensive changes to their current in house methods."

  "description": "Modification of a PE/PPE substrate pair reroutes an Esx substrate pair from the mycobacterial ESX-1 type VII secretion system to the ESX-5 systemBacterial type VII secretion systems (T7SSs) secrete a wide range of extracellular proteins that play important roles in bacterial viability and in interactions of pathogenic mycobacteria with their hosts. Mycobacterial T7SSs consist of five subtypes, ESX-1-5, and have four substrate classes, namely, Esx, PE, PPE, and Esp proteins. At least some of these substrates are secreted as heterodimers. Each ESX system mediates the secretion of a specific set of Esx, PE, and PPE proteins, raising the question how these substrates are recognized in a system-specific fashion. For the PE/PPE heterodimers, it has been shown that they interact with their cognate EspG chaperone and that this chaperone determines the designated secretion pathway. However, both structural and pulldown analyses have suggested that EspG cannot interact with the Esx proteins. Therefore, the determining factor for system specificity of the Esx proteins remains unknown. Here, we investigated the secretion specificity of the ESX-1 substrate pair EsxB_1/EsxA_1 in Mycobacterium marinum While this substrate pair was hardly secreted when homologously expressed, it was secreted when co-expressed together with the PE35/PPE68_1 pair, indicating that this pair could stimulate secretion of the EsxB_1/EsxA_1 pair. Surprisingly, co-expression of EsxB_1/EsxA_1 with a modified PE35/PPE68_1 version that carried the EspG5 chaperone-binding domain, previously shown to redirect this substrate pair to the ESX-5 system, also resulted in redirection and co-secretion of the Esx pair via ESX-5. Our results suggest a secretion model in which PE35/PPE68_1 determines the system-specific secretion of EsxB_1/EsxA_1."

  "description": "Aralar Sequesters GABA into Hyperactive Mitochondria, Causing Social Behavior DeficitsSocial impairment is frequently associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and altered neurotransmission. Although mitochondrial function is crucial for brain homeostasis, it remains unknown whether mitochondrial disruption contributes to social behavioral deficits. Here, we show that Drosophila mutants in the homolog of the human CYFIP1, a gene linked to autism and schizophrenia, exhibit mitochondrial hyperactivity and altered group behavior. We identify the regulation of GABA availability by mitochondrial activity as a biologically relevant mechanism and demonstrate its contribution to social behavior. Specifically, increased mitochondrial activity causes gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) sequestration in the mitochondria, reducing GABAergic signaling and resulting in social deficits. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation of mitochondrial activity or GABA signaling corrects the observed abnormalities. We identify Aralar as the mitochondrial transporter that sequesters GABA upon increased mitochondrial activity. This study increases our understanding of how mitochondria modulate neuronal homeostasis and social behavior under physiopathological conditions."

However, accurate modeling of halogen bond interactions remains a challenge, since a thorough theoretical investigation of the bonding mechanism, focusing on the realistic complexity of drug-receptor systems, is lacking. Our systematic quantum-chemical study on ligand/peptide-like systems reveals that halogen bonding is driven by the same bonding interactions as hydrogen bonding. Besides the electrostatic and the dispersion interactions, our bonding analyses, based on quantitative Kohn-Sham molecular orbital theory together with energy decomposition analysis, reveal that donor-acceptor interactions and steric repulsion between the occupied orbitals of the halogenated ligand and the protein need to be considered more carefully within the drug design process."

In this framework, the optical properties of closed-shell Ag, Au and bimetallic Ag-Au nanoparticles with tetrahedral symmetry (with 20, 56, 120, and 165 atoms) and icosahedral structure (with 13, 55, and 147 atoms) were obtained and compared to full linear response time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) as a reference and also to time-dependent density functional based tight binding (TD-DFTB) as a low-cost alternative approach. We find an excellent agreement of TD-DFT+TB calculated absorption spectra with the TD-DFT reference with errors less than 0.15 eV in peak positions, while TD-DFTB shows larger errors of about 1 eV. The computational cost for the ground state calculation is identical for TD-DFT and TD-DFT+TB, but the excited state calculation becomes about a hundred times faster when applying the TB approximation and is then almost negligible for the overall timing of the calculation. In contrast to TD-DFTB, which can only be applied to element combinations for which a suitable DFTB parametrization is available, TD-DFT+TB can be applied to any combination of elements. To assess the accuracy of TD-DFT+TB for different combinations of atoms, the plasmonic properties of bimetallic clusters with different ratios of Ag and Au atoms were obtained and the trend of energy and intensity reproduced in good agreement with TD-DFT, which is not possible using TD-DFTB with standard parameter sets."

  "description": "Differential Role of Serines and Threonines in Intracellular Loop 3 and C-Terminal Tail of the Histamine H4 Receptor in \u03b2-Arrestin and G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase Interaction, Internalization, and SignalingThe histamine H4 receptor (H4R) activates G\u03b1i-mediated signaling and recruits \u03b2-arrestin2 upon stimulation with histamine. \u03b2-Arrestins play a regulatory role in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by interacting with phosphorylated serine and threonine residues in the GPCR C-terminal tail and intracellular loop 3, resulting in receptor desensitization and internalization. Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based biosensors, we show that G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) 2 and 3 are more quickly recruited to the H4R than \u03b2-arrestin1 and 2 upon agonist stimulation, whereas receptor internalization dynamics toward early endosomes was slower. Alanine-substitution revealed that a serine cluster at the distal end of the H4R C-terminal tail is essential for the recruitment of \u03b2-arrestin1/2, and consequently, receptor internalization and desensitization of G protein-driven extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 phosphorylation and label-free cellular impedance. In contrast, alanine substitution of serines and threonines in the intracellular loop 3 of the H4R did not affect \u03b2-arrestin2 recruitment and receptor desensitization, but reduced \u03b2-arrestin1 recruitment and internalization. Hence, \u03b2-arrestin recruitment to H4R requires the putative phosphorylated serine cluster in the H4R C-terminal tail, whereas putative phosphosites in the intracellular loop 3 have different effects on \u03b2-arrestin1 versus \u03b2-arrestin2. Mutation of these putative phosphosites in either intracellular loop 3 or the C-terminal tail did not affect the histamine-induced recruitment of GRK2 and GRK3 but does change the interaction of H4R with GRK5 and GRK6, respectively. Identification of H4R interactions with these proteins is a first step in the understanding how this receptor might be dysregulated in pathophysiological conditions."

  "description": "Toddler behavior, the home environment, and flame retardant exposureToddlers are at increased risk of dust ingestion and subsequently flame retardant (FR) exposure because they often play close to the floor and mouth hands and objects. Exposure to some FRs have been associated to endocrine disruption and neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous research has shown higher FR concentrations in toddlers\u2019 serum and urine, but which toddler-behaviors influence exposure levels remains to be determined. We investigated how toddler-behaviors are associated to FRs in hand wipes (HWs) and saliva. Fifty 8-18 month-old children from the Linking EDCs in maternal Nutrition to Child health study, were visited at home. The child's behavior was observed and assessed using a questionnaire. Hand-to-object behavior frequency was associated with HW tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP), tris(phenyl) phosphate, tris(methylphenyl) phosphate, and resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) levels above the detection limit. Children playing with electronics multiple times per week had higher TDCIPP HW levels compared to children playing with electronics once per month or never (p = 0.032 and p = 0.046). Frequent mouth-to-object and frequent mouthing a pacifier were associated with lower TDCIPP (p = 0.019) and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) HW levels, respectively (p = 0.002\u20130.019). Exposure estimates based on hand-to-mouth behavior did not exceed the available reference doses. This is the first study investigating toddler-behavior in relation to FR hand loadings. Although a range of behaviors was investigated, only a few showed a relation with FR HW levels, suggesting that toddler-behavior might not alone be responsible for the elevated FR levels in children. It is therefore important to explore other pathways including dermal absorption and inhalation."

  "description": "Comparison of molecular recognition of trimethyllysine and trimethylthialysine by epigenetic reader proteinsGaining a fundamental insight into the biomolecular recognition of posttranslationally modified histones by epigenetic reader proteins is of crucial importance to understanding the regulation of the activity of human genes. Here, we seek to establish whether trimethylthialysine, a simple trimethyllysine analogue generated through cysteine alkylation, is a good trimethyllysine mimic for studies on molecular recognition by reader proteins. Histone peptides bearing trimethylthialysine and trimethyllysine were examined for binding with five human reader proteins employing a combination of thermodynamic analyses, molecular dynamics simulations and quantum chemical analyses. Collectively, our experimental and computational findings reveal that trimethylthialysine and trimethyllysine exhibit very similar binding characteristics for the association with human reader proteins, thereby justifying the use of trimethylthialysine for studies aimed at dissecting the origin of biomolecular recognition in epigenetic processes that play important roles in human health and disease."

  "description": "A framework for exhaustive modelling of genetic interaction patterns using Petri netsMotivation: Genetic interaction (GI) patterns are characterized by the phenotypes of interacting single and double mutated gene pairs. Uncovering the regulatory mechanisms of GIs would provide a better understanding of their role in biological processes, diseases and drug response. Computational analyses can provide insights into the underpinning mechanisms of GIs. Results: In this study, we present a framework for exhaustive modelling of GI patterns using Petri nets (PN). Four-node models were defined and generated on three levels with restrictions, to enable an exhaustive approach. Simulations suggest \u223c5 million models of GIs. Generalizing these we propose putative mechanisms for the GI patterns, inversion and suppression. We demonstrate that exhaustive PN modelling enables reasoning about mechanisms of GIs when only the phenotypes of gene pairs are known. The framework can be applied to other GI or genetic regulatory datasets."

  "description": "Evaluation of phthalazinone phosphodiesterase inhibitors with improved activity and selectivity against Trypanosoma cruziBACKGROUND: Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, needs urgent alternative therapeutic options as the treatments currently available display severe limitations, mainly related to efficacy and toxicity. OBJECTIVES: As phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have been claimed as novel targets against T. cruzi, our aim was to evaluate the biological aspects of 12 new phthalazinone PDE inhibitors against different T. cruzi strains and parasite forms relevant for human infection. METHODS: In vitro trypanocidal activity of the inhibitors was assessed alone and in combination with benznidazole. Their effects on parasite ultrastructural and cAMP levels were determined. PDE mRNA levels from the different T. cruzi forms were measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. RESULTS: Five TcrPDEs were found to be expressed in all parasite stages. Four compounds displayed strong effects against intracellular amastigotes. Against bloodstream trypomastigotes (BTs), three were at least as potent as benznidazole. In vitro combination therapy with one of the most active inhibitors on both parasite forms (NPD-040) plus benznidazole demonstrated a quite synergistic profile (x\u03a3 FICI\u2009=\u20090.58) against intracellular amastigotes but no interaction (x\u03a3 FICI\u2009=\u20091.27) when BTs were assayed. BTs treated with NPD-040 presented disrupted Golgi apparatus, a swollen flagellar pocket and signs of autophagy. cAMP measurements of untreated parasites showed that amastigotes have higher ability to efflux this second messenger than BTs. NPD-001 and NPD-040 increase the intracellular cAMP content in both BTs and amastigotes, which is also released into the extracellular milieu. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrate the potential of PDE inhibitors as anti-T. cruzi drug candidates."

  "description": "High throughput screening and identification of coagulopathic snake venom proteins and peptides using nanofractionation and proteomics approachesSnakebite is a neglected tropical disease that results in a variety of systemic and local pathologies in envenomed victims and is responsible for around 138,000 deaths every year. Many snake venoms cause severe coagulopathy that makes victims vulnerable to suffering life-threating haemorrhage. The mechanisms of action of coagulopathic snake venom toxins are diverse and can result in both anticoagulant and procoagulant effects. However, because snake venoms consist of a mixture of numerous protein and peptide components, high throughput characterizations of specific target bioactives is challenging. In this study, we applied a combination of analytical and pharmacological methods to identify snake venom toxins from a wide diversity of snake species that perturb coagulation. To do so, we used a high-throughput screening approach consisting of a miniaturised plasma coagulation assay in combination with a venom nanofractionation approach. Twenty snake venoms were first separated using reversed-phase liquid chromatography, and a post-column split allowed a small fraction to be analyzed with mass spectrometry, while the larger fraction was collected and dispensed onto 384-well plates. After fraction collection, any solvent present in the wells was removed by means of freeze-drying, after which it was possible to perform a plasma coagulation assay in order to detect coagulopathic activity. Our results demonstrate that many snake venoms simultaneously contain both procoagulant and anticoagulant bioactives that contribute to coagulopathy. In-depth identification analysis from seven medically-important venoms, via mass spectrometry and nanoLC-MS/MS, revealed that phospholipase A2 toxins are frequently identified in anticoagulant venom fractions, while serine protease and metalloproteinase toxins are often associated with procoagulant bioactivities. The nanofractionation and proteomics approach applied herein seems likely to be a valuable tool for the rational development of next-generation snakebite treatments by facilitating the rapid identification and fractionation of coagulopathic toxins, thereby enabling specific targeting of these toxins by new therapeutics such as monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors."

  "description": "Polarisable force fields: what do they add in biomolecular simulations?The quality of biomolecular simulations critically depends on the accuracy of the force field used to calculate the potential energy of the molecular configurations. Currently, most simulations employ non-polarisable force fields, which describe electrostatic interactions as the sum of Coulombic interactions between fixed atomic charges. Polarisation of these charge distributions is incorporated only in a mean-field manner. In the past decade, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing simple, efficient, and yet generally applicable polarisable force fields for biomolecular simulations. In this review, we summarise the latest developments in accounting for key biomolecular interactions with polarisable force fields and applications to address challenging biological questions. In the end, we provide an outlook for future development in polarisable force fields."

  "description": "Proteomimetics as protein-inspired scaffolds with defined tertiary folding patternsProteins have evolved as a variable platform that provides access to molecules with diverse shapes, sizes and functions. These features have inspired chemists for decades to seek artificial mimetics of proteins with improved or novel properties. Such work has focused primarily on small protein fragments, often isolated secondary structures; however, there has lately been a growing interest in the design of artificial molecules that mimic larger, more complex tertiary folds. In this Perspective, we define these agents as \u2018proteomimetics\u2019 and discuss the recent advances in the field. Proteomimetics can be divided into three categories: protein domains with side-chain functionality that alters the native linear-chain topology; protein domains in which the chemical composition of the polypeptide backbone has been partially altered; and protein-like folded architectures that are composed entirely of non-natural monomer units. We give an overview of these proteomimetic approaches and outline remaining challenges facing the field."

  "description": "Why are consumers willing to pay more for liquid foods in environmentally friendly packaging? A dual attitudes perspectiveConsidering that one of the key components of liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging is its higher price, it may not be appealing to all consumers. However, a growing body of evidence has shown that the sale of liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging is increasing. The purpose of this study was to analyze why consumers are willing to pay more for liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging. Drawing on the theory of dual attitudes by Wilson, Lindsey, and Schooler, this study proposes that consumer purchasing behavior can be explained through implicit and explicit attitudes. Moreover, a consumer's ecoliteracy and ecofriendly lifestyle might be important predictors of consumer attitudes toward environmentally friendly packaging. Our conceptual model was tested on survey data from 11 countries, with a total of 7028 respondents. The study revealed that consumers' willingness to pay a higher price for liquid food in environmentally friendly packaging could be predicted by their positive attitudes toward (a) the environmental friendliness of the packaging, (b) the brand of the liquid food, and (c) the affordability of the liquid food in the environmentally friendly packaging. Ecoliteracy and having an ecofriendly lifestyle were found to be important predictors of consumer attitudes toward environmentally friendly packaging. This study contributes to the literature that aims to explain consumers' willingness to pay more for food in environmentally friendly packaging. It identifies how much more consumers are willing to pay for food in environmentally friendly packaging and why."

  "description": "Clb3-centered regulations are recurrent across distinct parameter regions in minimal autonomous cell cycle oscillator designsSome biological networks exhibit oscillations in their components to convert stimuli to time-dependent responses. The eukaryotic cell cycle is such a case, being governed by waves of cyclin-dependent kinase (cyclin/Cdk) activities that rise and fall with specific timing and guarantee its timely occurrence. Disruption of cyclin/Cdk oscillations could result in dysfunction through reduced cell division. Therefore, it is of interest to capture properties of network designs that exhibit robust oscillations. Here we show that a minimal yeast cell cycle network is able to oscillate autonomously, and that cyclin/Cdk-mediated positive feedback loops (PFLs) and Clb3-centered regulations sustain cyclin/Cdk oscillations, in known and hypothetical network designs. We propose that Clb3-mediated coordination of cyclin/Cdk waves reconciles checkpoint and oscillatory cell cycle models. Considering the evolutionary conservation of the cyclin/Cdk network across eukaryotes, we hypothesize that functional (\"healthy\") phenotypes require the capacity to oscillate autonomously whereas dysfunctional (potentially \"diseased\") phenotypes may lack this capacity."

Lehtola, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 1593-1604 (2019)]. Here, we study the differences between effective potentials from fully numerical density functional and optimized effective potential calculations for fixed configurations. We find that the differences are small, overall, and choose exchange-only potentials at the local density approximation level of theory computed on top of Hartree-Fock densities as a good compromise. The differences between potentials arising from different atomic configurations are also found to be small at this level of theory. Furthermore, we discuss the efficient Gaussian-basis implementation of SAP via error function fits to fully numerical atomic radial potentials. The guess obtained from the fitted potentials can be easily implemented in any Gaussian-basis quantum chemistry code in terms of two-electron integrals. Fits covering the whole periodic table from H to Og are reported for non-relativistic as well as fully relativistic four-component calculations that have been carried out with fully numerical approaches."

  "title": "A community proposal to integrate structural bioinformatics activities in ELIXIR (3D-Bioinfo Community)Structural bioinformatics provides the scientific methods and tools to analyse, archive, validate, and present the biomolecular structure data generated by the structural biology community. It also provides an important link with the genomics community, as structural bioinformaticians also use the extensive sequence data to predict protein structures and their functional sites. A very broad and active community of structural bioinformaticians exists across Europe, and 3D-Bioinfo will establish formal platforms to address their needs and better integrate their activities and initiatives. Our mission will be to strengthen the ties with the structural biology research communities in Europe covering life sciences, as well as chemistry and physics and to bridge the gap between these researchers in order to fully realize the potential of structural bioinformatics. Our Community will also undertake dedicated educational, training and outreach efforts to facilitate this, bringing new insights and thus facilitating the development of much needed innovative applications e.g. for human health, drug and protein design. Our combined efforts will be of critical importance to keep the European research efforts competitive in this respect. Here we highlight the major European contributions to the field of structural bioinformatics, the most pressing challenges remaining and how Europe-wide interactions, enabled by ELIXIR and its platforms, will help in addressing these challenges and in coordinating structural bioinformatics resources across Europe. In particular, we present recent activities and future plans to consolidate an ELIXIR 3D-Bioinfo Community in structural bioinformatics and propose means to develop better links across the community. These include building new consortia, organising workshops to establish data standards and seeking community agreement on benchmark data sets and strategies. We also highlight existing and planned collaborations with other ELIXIR Communities and other European infrastructures, such as the structural biology community supported by Instruct-ERIC, with whom we have synergies and overlapping common interests.General information",

  "description": "A community proposal to integrate structural bioinformatics activities in ELIXIR (3D-Bioinfo Community)Structural bioinformatics provides the scientific methods and tools to analyse, archive, validate, and present the biomolecular structure data generated by the structural biology community. It also provides an important link with the genomics community, as structural bioinformaticians also use the extensive sequence data to predict protein structures and their functional sites. A very broad and active community of structural bioinformaticians exists across Europe, and 3D-Bioinfo will establish formal platforms to address their needs and better integrate their activities and initiatives. Our mission will be to strengthen the ties with the structural biology research communities in Europe covering life sciences, as well as chemistry and physics and to bridge the gap between these researchers in order to fully realize the potential of structural bioinformatics. Our Community will also undertake dedicated educational, training and outreach efforts to facilitate this, bringing new insights and thus facilitating the development of much needed innovative applications e.g. for human health, drug and protein design. Our combined efforts will be of critical importance to keep the European research efforts competitive in this respect. Here we highlight the major European contributions to the field of structural bioinformatics, the most pressing challenges remaining and how Europe-wide interactions, enabled by ELIXIR and its platforms, will help in addressing these challenges and in coordinating structural bioinformatics resources across Europe. In particular, we present recent activities and future plans to consolidate an ELIXIR 3D-Bioinfo Community in structural bioinformatics and propose means to develop better links across the community. These include building new consortia, organising workshops to establish data standards and seeking community agreement on benchmark data sets and strategies. We also highlight existing and planned collaborations with other ELIXIR Communities and other European infrastructures, such as the structural biology community supported by Instruct-ERIC, with whom we have synergies and overlapping common interests."

  "description": "Linking leaders' voluntary workplace green behavior and team green innovation: The mediation role of team green efficacyGiven the increasing significance of green innovation, scholars have identified environment-oriented leader behavior as a key antecedent of green innovation in firms. However, despite the fact that previous studies highlight all kinds of benefits of environment-oriented leaders' voluntary workplace green behavior (VWGB) in and for firms, little is known about how these leaders' VWGB could affect a firm team's green product innovation as well as their process innovation. To narrow this research gap, this study theorizes and tests the effect of leaders' VWGB on their team's green innovation, as well as the mediation effect of team green efficacy belief on this relationship. Using a time-lagged research design, we collected data from 497 employees and 80 leaders in Chinese manufacturing firms. The results show that leaders' VWGB directly affects both their team's green product and process innovation, and facilitates the development of team green efficacy, which in turn stimulates team green innovation. This present study extends the multilevel phenomena by reinforcing the importance of leaders' VWGB and team green efficacy on team-level green innovation, and provides practical implications on developing leadership for environmentally sustainable innovation."

  "description": "Novel brominated flame retardants - A review of their occurrence in indoor air, dust, consumer goods and foodThis critical review summarizes the occurrence of 63 novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) in indoor air, dust, consumer goods and food. It includes their EU registration and (potential) risks. The increasing application of NBFRs calls for more research on their occurrence, environmental fate and toxicity. This review reports which NBFRs are actually being studied, which are detected and which are of most concern. It also connects data from the European Chemical Association on NBFRs with other scientific information. Large knowledge gaps emerged for 28 (out of 63) NBFRs, which were not included in any monitoring programs or other studies. This also indicates the need for optimized analytical methods including all NBFRs. Further research on indoor environments, emission sources and potential leaching is also necessary. High concentrations of 2-ethylhexyl 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EH-TBB), bis(2-ethylhexyl)tetrabromophthalate (BEH-TEBP), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) were often reported. The detection of hexabromobenzene (HBB), pentabromotoluene (PBT), 1,4-dimethyltetrabromobenzene (TBX), 4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)-1,2-dibromocyclohexane (DBE-DBCH) and tetrabromobisphenol A bis(2,3-dibromopropyl) ether (TBBPA-BDBPE) also raises concern."

  "description": "Removing critical gaps in chemical test methods by developing new assays for the identification of thyroid hormone system-disrupting chemicals\u2014the ATHENA projectThe test methods that currently exist for the identification of thyroid hormone system-disrupting chemicals are woefully inadequate. There are currently no internationally validated in vitro assays, and test methods that can capture the consequences of diminished or enhanced thyroid hormone action on the developing brain are missing entirely. These gaps put the public at risk and risk assessors in a difficult position. Decisions about the status of chemicals as thyroid hormone system disruptors currently are based on inadequate toxicity data. The ATHENA project (Assays for the identification of Thyroid Hormone axis-disrupting chemicals: Elaborating Novel Assessment strategies) has been conceived to address these gaps. The project will develop new test methods for the disruption of thyroid hormone transport across biological barriers such as the blood\u2013brain and blood\u2013placenta barriers. It will also devise methods for the disruption of the downstream effects on the brain. ATHENA will deliver a testing strategy based on those elements of the thyroid hormone system that, when disrupted, could have the greatest impact on diminished or enhanced thyroid hormone action and therefore should be targeted through effective testing. To further enhance the impact of the ATHENA test method developments, the project will develop concepts for better international collaboration and development in the area of thyroid hormone system disruptor identification and regulation."

  "description": "Evaluation of LC-MS and LC\u00d7LC-MS in analysis of zebrafish embryo samples for comprehensive lipid profilingIn this study, both conventional one-dimensional liquid chromatography (1DLC) and comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) coupled to a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer (HR-TOF MS) were used for full-scale lipid characterization of lipid extracts from zebrafish embryos. We investigated the influence on annotated lipids and different separation mechanisms (HILIC, C18, and PFP), and their different orders arranged in the first and the second dimensions. As a result, the number of lipid species annotated by conventional one-dimensional LC-MS was between 212 and 448. In contrast, the number of individual lipids species annotated by C18\u00d7HILIC, HILIC\u00d7C18, and HILIC\u00d7PFP were 1784, 1059, and 1123, respectively. Therefore, it was evident that the performance of comprehensive 2DLC, especially the C18\u00d7HILIC method, considerably exceeded 1DLC. Interestingly, a comparison of the HILIC\u00d7C18 and C18\u00d7HILIC approaches showed, under the optimized conditions, similar orthogonality, but the effective separation power of the C18\u00d7HILIC was much higher. A comparison of the HILIC\u00d7C18 and the HILIC\u00d7PFP methods demonstrated that the HILIC\u00d7PFP separation had superior orthogonality with a small increase on its effective peak capacity, indicating that the HILIC\u00d7PFP combination maybe a promising platform for untargeted lipidomics in complex samples. Finally, from the comprehensive lipid profiling respective, the C18\u00d7HILIC was selected for further studies."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

However, it remains to be applied to the ocular surface diseases, where biological samples are often of limited quantities. We successfully performed proof-of-concept metabolomics assessment of volume-limited cytology samples from a clinical form of chronic inflammatory cicatrizing conjunctivitis, i.e., ocular MMP and discovered metabolic changes of signaling lipid mediators upon disease onset and progression. The metabolomics assessment revealed active oxylipins, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and endocannabinoids alterations, from which potential biomarkers linked to inflammatory processes were identified. Possible underlying mechanisms such as dysregulated enzyme activities (e.g., lipoxygenases, cytochrome P450, and phospholipases) were suggested which may be considered as potential therapeutic targets in future studies. Key messages: Metabolic profile of the ocular surface can be measured using impression cytology samples.Metabolomics analysis of ocular pemphigoid is presented for the first time.The metabolomics assessment of OCP patients revealed active oxylipins, lysophospholipids, fatty acids, and endocannabinoids alterations.Several oxylipins are identified as diagnostic biomarkers for OCP."

We show that addition of butylamine to a nanoplatelet (NPL) dispersion maximally displaces \u223c40% of the original Cd(Ol)2 capping. On the basis of density functional theory simulations, we argue that this behavior reflects the preferential displacement of Cd(Ol)2 from (near)-edge surface sites. Opposite from CdSe core NPLs, core/crown NPL dispersions can retain 45% of their initial photoluminescence efficiency after ligand displacement, while radiative exciton recombination keeps dominating the luminescent decay. Using electron microscopy observations, we assign this robust photoluminescence to NPLs with a complete CdS crown, which prevents charge carrier trapping in the near-edge surface sites created by ligand displacement. We conclude that Z-type ligands such as cadmium carboxylates can provide full electronic passivation of (100) facets yet are prone to displacement from (near)-edge surface sites."

  "description": "Quantitative analysis of amino acid metabolism in liver cancer links glutamate excretion to nucleotide synthesisMany cancer cells consume glutamine at high rates; counterintuitively, they simultaneously excrete glutamate, the first intermediate in glutamine metabolism. Glutamine consumption has been linked to replenishment of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates and synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but the reason for glutamate excretion is unclear. Here, we dynamically profile the uptake and excretion fluxes of a liver cancer cell line (HepG2) and use genome-scale metabolic modeling for in-depth analysis. We find that up to 30% of the glutamine is metabolized in the cytosol, primarily for nucleotide synthesis, producing cytosolic glutamate. We hypothesize that excreting glutamate helps the cell to increase the nucleotide synthesis rate to sustain growth. Indeed, we show experimentally that partial inhibition of glutamate excretion reduces cell growth. Our integrative approach thus links glutamine addiction to glutamate excretion in cancer and points toward potential drug targets."

However, the molecular players and the mechanisms regulating the gene-specific expression of tRNAs are still unknown. Using an inducible auxin-degron system to rapidly deplete RPB1 (the largest subunit of RNA Pol II) in living cells, we identified Pol II as a direct gene-specific regulator of tRNA transcription. Our data suggest that Pol II transcription robustly interferes with Pol III function at specific tRNA genes. This activity was further found to be essential for MAF1-mediated repression of a large set of tRNA genes during serum starvation, indicating that repression of tRNA genes by Pol II is dynamically regulated. Hence, Pol II plays a direct and central role in the gene-specific regulation of tRNA expression."

  "description": "Predictors with regard to ingestion, inhalation and dermal absorption of estimated phthalate daily intakes in pregnant women: The Barwon infant studyHuman exposure to phthalate chemicals, used in consumer product plastics, occurs throughout the day. Phthalate levels in pregnant women are associated with offspring health effects including obesity and neurodevelopmental problems. Knowledge of predictors of exposure is necessary in order to effectively reduce phthalate exposure. The present study aims to identify predictors of phthalate levels in Australian pregnant women from the Barwon Infant study birth cohort. Maternal urine samples from 841 women were analyzed for phthalate metabolites. Maternal diet and food preparation practices, use of volatile household products, household characteristics and personal care product use were assessed with questionnaires. All maternal urine contained phthalate metabolites. Maternal prenatal high-fat milk consumption was associated with higher benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) (p < 0.001), and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) (p = 0.0023). Higher phthalate levels were associated with consumption of tinned food (fish and tomatoes). Diethyl phthalate (DEP) levels were significantly higher when women reported using air freshener (35% increase, p = 0.01), aerosols (40% increase, p = 0.005), hair treatment chemicals (28% increase, p = 0.031), and chlorine (34% increase, p = 0.009) compared to no use. Maternal phthalate levels did not vary by reported plastic avoidance during pregnancy. The study showed that phthalate exposure is ubiquitous and increased by multiple factors. Future intervention studies to reduce phthalate levels among pregnant women will need to take into account the variety of sources identified in this study."

  "description": "Suspect and non-targeted screening of chemicals of emerging concern for human biomonitoring, environmental health studies and support to risk assessment: From promises to challenges and harmonisation issuesLarge-scale suspect and non-targeted screening approaches based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) are today available for chemical profiling and holistic characterisation of biological samples. These advanced techniques allow the simultaneous detection of a large number of chemical features, including markers of human chemical exposure. Such markers are of interest for biomonitoring, environmental health studies and support to risk assessment. Furthermore, these screening approaches have the promising capability to detect chemicals of emerging concern (CECs), document the extent of human chemical exposure, generate new research hypotheses and provide early warning support to policy. Whilst of growing importance in the environment and food safety areas, respectively, CECs remain poorly addressed in the field of human biomonitoring. This shortfall is due to several scientific and methodological reasons, including a global lack of harmonisation. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to present an overview of the basic principles, promises and challenges of suspect and non-targeted screening approaches applied to human samples as this specific field introduce major specificities compared to other fields. Focused on liquid chromatography coupled to HRMS-based data acquisition methods, this overview addresses all steps of these new analytical workflows. Beyond this general picture, the main activities carried out on this topic within the particular framework of the European Human Biomonitoring initiative (project HBM4EU, 2017\u20132021) are described, with an emphasis on harmonisation measures."

  "description": "Viral G protein-coupled receptors as modulators of cancer hallmarksHerpesviruses encode transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which share structural homology to human chemokine receptors. These viral GPCRs include KSHV-encoded ORF74, EBV-encoded BILF1, and HCMV-encoded US28, UL33, UL78 and US27. Viral GPCRs hijack various signaling pathways and cellular networks, including pathways involved in the so-called cancer hallmarks as defined by Hanahan and Weinberg. These hallmarks describe cellular characteristics crucial for transformation and tumor progression. The cancer hallmarks involve growth factor-independent proliferation, angiogenesis, avoidance of apoptosis, invasion and metastasis, metabolic reprogramming, genetic instability and immune evasion amongst others. The role of beta herpesviruses modulating these cancer hallmarks is clearly highlighted by the proliferative and pro-angiogenic phenotype associated with KSHV infection which is largely ascribed to the ORF74-mediated modulation of signaling networks in host cells. For HCMV and Epstein-Bar encoded GPCRs, oncomodulatory effects have been described which contribute to the cancer hallmarks, thereby enhancing oncogenic development. In this review, we describe the main signaling pathways controlling the hallmarks of cancer which are affected by the betaherpesvirus encoded GPCRs. Most prominent among these involve the JAK-STAT, PI(3)K-AKT, NFkB and MAPK signaling nodes. These insights are important to effectively target these viral GPCRs and their signaling networks in betaherpesvirus-associated malignancies."

Although it has been well established that many polar functionalities interact with electron-rich aromatic residues through energetically favorable polar-\u03c0 interactions, there is a limited understanding of the association between thiols and aromatic systems. Herein we report physical-organic chemistry studies on 2,6-diarylthiophenols that possess the central thiophenol ring and two flanking aromatic rings with tunable electronic properties caused by substituents at distant para position. Hammett analysis revealed that pKa values and proton affinities correlate well with Hammett sigma values of substituents. Additional energy decomposition analysis supported the conclusion that both through-space SH-\u03c0 interactions and S\u2212-\u03c0 interactions contribute to intramolecular stabilization of 2,6-diarylthiophenols."

  "description": "A dual attack on the peroxide bond. The common principle of peroxidatic cysteine or selenocysteine residuesThe (seleno)cysteine residues in some protein families react with hydroperoxides with rate constants far beyond those of fully dissociated low molecular weight thiol or selenol compounds. In case of the glutathione peroxidases, we could demonstrate that high rate constants are achieved by a proton transfer from the chalcogenol to a residue of the active site [Orian et al. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 87 (2015)]. We extended this study to three more protein families (OxyR, GAPDH and Prx). According to DFT calculations, a proton transfer from the active site chalcogenol to a residue within the active site is a prerequisite for both, creating a chalcogenolate that attacks one oxygen of the hydroperoxide substrate and combining the delocalized proton with the remaining OH or OR, respectively, to create an ideal leaving group. The \u201cparking postions\u201d of the delocalized proton differ between the protein families. It is the ring nitrogen of tryptophan in GPx, a histidine in GAPDH and OxyR and a threonine in Prx. The basic principle, however, is common to all four families of proteins. We, thus, conclude that the principle outlined in this investigation offers a convincing explanation for how a cysteine residue can become peroxidatic."

  "description": "Double hybrid DFT calculations with Slater type orbitalsOn a comprehensive database with 1,644 datapoints, covering several aspects of main-group as well as of transition metal chemistry, we assess the performance of 60 density functional approximations (DFA), among them 36 double hybrids (DH). All calculations are performed using a Slater type orbital (STO) basis set of triple-\u03b6 (TZ) quality and the highly efficient pair atomic resolution of the identity approach for the exchange- and Coulomb-term of the KS matrix (PARI-K and PARI-J, respectively) and for the evaluation of the MP2 energy correction (PARI-MP2). Employing the quadratic scaling SOS-AO-PARI-MP2 algorithm, DHs based on the spin-opposite-scaled (SOS) MP2 approximation are benchmarked against a database of large molecules. We evaluate the accuracy of STO/PARI calculations for B3LYP as well as for the DH B2GP-PLYP and show that the combined basis set and PARI-error is comparable to the one obtained using the well-known def2-TZVPP Gaussian-type basis set in conjunction with global density fitting. While quadruple-\u03b6 (QZ) calculations are currently not feasible for PARI-MP2 due to numerical issues, we show that, on the TZ level, Jacob's ladder for classifying DFAs is reproduced. However, while the best DHs are more accurate than the best hybrids, the improvements are less pronounced than the ones commonly found on the QZ level. For conformers of organic molecules and noncovalent interactions where very high accuracy is required for qualitatively correct results, DHs provide only small improvements over hybrids, while they still excel in thermochemistry, kinetics, transition metal chemistry and the description of strained organic systems."

The sensitivity of eight pre-selected bacterial strains were tested to a training set of ten antibiotics, i.e. three Gram+ Bacillus subtilis strains with different read-outs, and five Gram\u2212 strains. The latter group consisted of a bioluminescent Allivibrio fischeri strain and four Escherichia coli strains, i.e. a wild type (WT) and three strains with a modified cell envelope to increase their sensitivity. The WT B. subtilis and an E. coli strain newly developed in this study, were most sensitive to the training set. This E. coli strain carries an open variant of an outer membrane protein combined with an inactivated multidrug efflux transport system. The assay conditions of these two strains were optimized and validated by exposure to a validation set of thirteen antibiotics with clinical and environmental relevance. The assay sensitivity ranged from the ng/mL to \u03bcg/mL range. The applicability of the assays for toxicological characterization of aquatic environmental samples was demonstrated for hospital effluent extract. A future application includes effect-directed analysis to identify yet unknown antibiotic contaminants or their transformation products."

  "description": "Safeguarding female reproductive health against endocrine disrupting chemicals\u2014The FREIA projectCurrently available test methods are not well-suited for the identification of chemicals that disturb hormonal processes involved in female reproductive development and function. This renders women\u2019s reproductive health at increasing risk globally, which, coupled with increasing incidence rates of reproductive disorders, is of great concern. A woman\u2019s reproductive health is largely established during embryonic and fetal development and subsequently matures during puberty. The endocrine system influences development, maturation, and function of the female reproductive system, thereby making appropriate hormone levels imperative for correct functioning of reproductive processes. It is concerning that the effects of human-made chemicals on the endocrine system and female reproductive health are poorly addressed in regulatory chemical safety assessment, partly because adequate test methods are lacking. Our EU-funded project FREIA aims to address this need by increasing understanding of how endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can impact female reproductive health. We will use this information to provide better test methods that enable fit-for-purpose chemical regulation and then share our knowledge, promote a sustainable society, and improve the reproductive health of women globally."

  "description": "The hydrophobic effect characterises the thermodynamic signature of amyloid fibril growthMany proteins have the potential to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, protein polymers associated with a wide range of human disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The thermodynamic stability of amyloid fibrils, in contrast to that of folded proteins, is not well understood: the balance between entropic and enthalpic terms, including the chain entropy and the hydrophobic effect, are poorly characterised. Using a combination of theory, in vitro experiments, simulations of a coarse-grained protein model and meta-data analysis, we delineate the enthalpic and entropic contributions that dominate amyloid fibril elongation. Our prediction of a characteristic temperature-dependent enthalpic signature is confirmed by the performed calorimetric experiments and a meta-analysis over published data. From these results we are able to define the necessary conditions to observe cold denaturation of amyloid fibrils. Overall, we show that amyloid fibril elongation is associated with a negative heat capacity, the magnitude of which correlates closely with the hydrophobic surface area that is buried upon fibril formation, highlighting the importance of hydrophobicity for fibril stability."

  "description": "You Are What You Eat, Microplastics in Porbeagle Sharks From the North East Atlantic: Method Development and Analysis in Spiral Valve Content and TissueResearchers worldwide are studying the environmental distribution and impacts of manufactured or environmentally fragmented small pieces of plastics, so called microplastics (<5 mm). These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the North-East Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators."

  "description": "A histone-like motif in yellow fever virus contributes to viral replicationThe mimicry of host proteins by viruses contributes to their ability to suppress antiviral immunity and hijack host biosynthetic machinery. Host adaptation to evade this exploitation depends on host protein functional redundancy. Non-redundant, essential host proteins have limited potential to adapt without severe consequences. Histones, which are essential for genome architecture and control of gene expression, are among the most evolutionary conserved proteins. Here we show that the capsid protein of the flavivirus yellow fever virus (YFV), mimics histone H4 and interferes with chromatin gene regulation by BRD4, a bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) protein. Two acetyl-lysine residues of YFV capsid are embedded in a histone-like motif that interacts with the BRD4 bromodomain, affecting gene expression and influencing YFV replication. These findings reveal histone mimicry as a strategy employed by an RNA virus that replicates in the cytosol and define convergent and distinct molecular determinants for motif recognition of the viral mimic versus histone H4.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest."

  "description": "Preclinical validation of a repurposed metal chelator as an early-intervention therapeutic for hemotoxic snakebiteSnakebite envenoming causes 138,000 deaths annually, and ~400,000 victims are left with permanent disabilities. Envenoming by saw-scaled vipers (Viperidae: Echis) leads to systemic hemorrhage and coagulopathy and represents a major cause of snakebite mortality and morbidity in Africa and Asia. The only specific treatment for snakebite, antivenom, has poor specificity and low affordability and must be administered in clinical settings because of its intravenous delivery and high rates of adverse reactions. This requirement results in major treatment delays in resource-poor regions and substantially affects patient outcomes after envenoming. Here, we investigated the value of metal ion chelators as prehospital therapeutics for snakebite. Among the tested chelators, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) and its derivative 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanesulfonic acid (DMPS) were found to potently antagonize the activity of Zn2+-dependent snake venom metalloproteinases in vitro. Moreover, DMPS prolonged or conferred complete survival in murine preclinical models of envenoming against a variety of saw-scaled viper venoms. DMPS also considerably extended survival in a \"challenge and treat\" model, where drug administration was delayed after venom injection and the oral administration of this chelator provided partial protection against envenoming. Last, the potential clinical scenario of early oral DMPS therapy combined with a delayed, intravenous dose of conventional antivenom provided prolonged protection against the lethal effects of envenoming in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that the safe and affordable repurposed metal chelator DMPS can effectively neutralize saw-scaled viper venoms in vitro and in vivo and highlight the promise of this drug as an early, prehospital, therapeutic intervention for hemotoxic snakebite envenoming."

  "description": "The omnistat: A flexible continuous-culture system for prolonged experimental evolutionMicrobial evolution experiments provide a powerful tool to unravel the molecular basis of adaptive evolution but their outcomes can be difficult to interpret, unless the selective forces that are applied during the experiment are carefully controlled. In this respect, experimental evolution in continuous cultures provides advantages over commonly used sequential batch-culture protocols because continuous cultures allow for more accurate control over the induced selective environment. However, commercial continuous-culture systems are large and expensive, while available DIY continuous-culture systems are not versatile enough to allow for multiple sensors and rigorous stirring. We present a modular continuous-culture system that adopts the commonly used GL45 glass laboratory bottle as a bioreactor vessel. Our design offers three advantages: first, it is equipped with a large head plate, fitting two sensors and seven input/output ports, enabling the customization of the system for many running modes (chemostat, auxostat, etc.). Second, the bioreactor is small (25\u2013250ml), which makes it feasible to run many replicates in parallel. Third, bioreactor modules can be coupled by uni- or bi-directional flows to induce spatiotemporal variation in selection. These features result in a particularly flexible culturing platform that facilitates the investigation of a broad range of evolutionary and ecological questions. To illustrate the versatility of our culturing system, we outline two evolution experiments that impose a temporally or spatially variable regime of selection. The first experiment illustrates how controlled temporal variation in resource availability can be utilized to select for anticipatory switching. The second experiment illustrates a spatially structured morbidostat setup that is designed to probe epistatic interactions between adaptive mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how sensor data can be used to stabilize selection pressures or track evolutionary adaptation. Evolution experiments in which populations are exposed to controlled spatiotemporal variation, are essential to gain insight into the process of adaptation and the mechanisms that constrain evolution. Continuous-culture systems, like the one presented here, offer control over key environmental parameters and establish a well-defined regime of selection. As such, they create the opportunity to expose evolutionary constraints in the form of phenotypic trade-offs, contributing to a mechanistic understanding of adaptive evolution."

  "description": "Human multidrug resistance protein 4 (MRP4) is a cellular efflux transporter for paracetamol glutathione and cysteine conjugatesParacetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) overdose is a leading cause of acute drug-induced liver failure. APAP hepatotoxicity is mediated by the reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is inactivated by conjugation with glutathione (GSH) to APAP-GSH, which is further converted into its cysteine derivative APAP-CYS. Before necrosis of hepatocytes occurs, APAP-CYS is measurable in plasma of the affected patient and it has been proposed as an early biomarker of acetaminophen toxicity. APAP-GSH and APAP-CYS can be extruded by hepatocytes, but the transporters involved are unknown. In this study we examined whether ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play a role in the cellular efflux of APAP, APAP-GSH, and APAP-CYS. The ABC transport proteins P-gp/ABCB1, BSEP/ABCB11, BCRP/ABCG2, and MRP/ABCC1-5 were overexpressed in HEK293 cells and membrane vesicles were produced. Whereas P-gp, BSEP, MRP3, MRP5, and BCRP did not transport any of the compounds, uptake of APAP-GSH was found for MRP1, MRP2 and MRP4. APAP-CYS appeared to be a substrate of MRP4 and none of the ABC proteins transported APAP. The results suggest that the NAPQI metabolite APAP-CYS can be excreted into plasma by MRP4, where it could be a useful biomarker for APAP exposure and toxicity. Characterization of the cellular efflux of APAP-CYS is important for its development as a biomarker, because plasma concentrations might be influenced by drug-transporter interactions and upregulation of MRP4."

However, birth cohort findings have been conflicting. This study aimed to (i) investigate the interplay between maternal prenatal phthalate levels, infant genetic vulnerability to oxidative stress, and child neurodevelopment and (ii) examine combined putative oxidant exposures. In a population-based birth cohort of 1064 women with prenatal recruitment in Victoria, Australia, maternal urine was collected at 36 weeks of pregnancy and phthalate metabolite concentrations measured. An unweighted genetic score for oxidative stress was made using a candidate gene approach. Cognition was assessed using the BAYLEY-III at two years (n = 678). Parents completed questionnaires for doctor diagnosed autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (1.4 %), ASD traits (4.9 %) and child inattention/hyperactivity (n = 791). Analyses included multiple linear and logistic regression. Higher prenatal phthalate levels and a higher oxidative stress genetic score were each associated with subsequent ASD. Several oxidative stress-related SNPs modified the association between prenatal phthalates and ASD and other outcomes. Consistent patterns were evident across gene score-phthalate combinations for cognition, ASD, ASD traits and inattention/hyperactivity. Other putative oxidant factors such as prenatal smoking further increased risk. Prenatal phthalate levels and infant oxidative stress-related genetic vulnerability are associated with adverse neurodevelopment. Combined exposures are important. Current recommendations and regulation on maternal phthalate exposure during pregnancy require re-evaluation."

  "description": "Human cytomegalovirus-encoded G protein-coupled receptor UL33 facilitates virus dissemination via the extracellular and cell-to-cell routeHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes four G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homologs. Three of these receptors, UL78, US27 and US28, are known for their roles in HCMV dissemination and latency. Despite importance of its rodent orthologs for viral replication and pathogenesis, such a function is not reported for the HCMV-encoded GPCR UL33. Using the clinical HCMV strain Merlin, we show that UL33 facilitates both cell-associated and cell-free virus transmission. A UL33-deficient virus derivative revealed retarded virus spread, formation of less and smaller plaques, and reduced extracellular progeny during multi-cycle growth analysis in fibroblast cultures compared to parental virus. The growth of UL33-revertant, US28-deficient, and US28-revertant viruses were similar to parental virus under multistep growth conditions. UL33- and US28-deficient Merlin viruses impaired cell-associated virus spread to a similar degree. Thus, the growth defect displayed by the UL33-deficient virus but not the US28-deficient virus reflects UL33\u2019s contribution to extracellular transmission. In conclusion, UL33 facilitates cell-associated and cell-free spread of the clinical HCMV strain Merlin in fibroblast cultures."

  "description": "Nanocrystals of Lead Chalcohalides: A Series of Kinetically Trapped Metastable NanostructuresWe report the colloidal synthesis of a series of surfactant-stabilized lead chalcohalide nanocrystals. Our work is mainly focused on Pb4S3Br2, a chalcohalide phase unknown to date that does not belong to the ambient-pressure PbS-PbBr2 phase diagram. The Pb4S3Br2 nanocrystals herein feature a remarkably narrow size distribution (with a size dispersion as low as 5%), a good size tunability (from 7 to \u223c30 nm), an indirect bandgap, photoconductivity (responsivity = 4 \u00b1 1 mA/W), and stability for months in air. A crystal structure is proposed for this new material by combining the information from 3D electron diffraction and electron tomography of a single nanocrystal, X-ray powder diffraction, and density functional theory calculations. Such a structure is closely related to that of the recently discovered high-pressure chalcohalide Pb4S3I2 phase, and indeed we were able to extend our synthesis scheme to Pb4S3I2 colloidal nanocrystals, whose structure matches the one that has been published for the bulk. Finally, we could also prepare nanocrystals of Pb3S2Cl2, which proved to be a structural analogue of the recently reported bulk Pb3Se2Br2 phase. It is remarkable that one high-pressure structure (for Pb4S3I2) and two metastable structures that had not yet been reported (for Pb4S3Br2 and Pb3S2Cl2) can be prepared on the nanoscale by wet-chemical approaches. This highlights the important role of colloidal chemistry in the discovery of new materials and motivates further exploration into metal chalcohalide nanocrystals."

The emission efficiency was maximized for low Ag+ amounts, reaching \u223c3% for the Cs2Na0.95Ag0.05BiCl6 composition. Density functional theory calculations coupled with spectroscopic investigations revealed that Cs2Na1-xAgxBiCl6 NCs are characterized by a complex photophysics stemming from the interplay of (i) radiative recombination via trapped excitons localized in spatially connected AgCl6-BiCl6 octahedra; (ii) surface traps, located on undercoordinated surface Bi centers, behaving as phonon-assisted nonradiative decay channels; and (iii) a thermal equilibrium between trapping and detrapping processes. These results offer insights into developing double-perovskite NCs with enhanced optoelectronic efficiency. "

For the first time, our combined activation strain and Kohn\u2013Sham molecular orbital analysis approach have revealed the interplay of physical factors that control the regioselectivity of these chemical reactions. Ring-opening under basic conditions occurs in a regime of strong interaction between the nucleophile (OH\u2013) and the epoxide and the interaction is governed by the steric (Pauli) repulsion. The latter steers the attack preferentially towards the sterically less encumbered C\u03b2. Under acidic conditions, the interaction between the nucleophile (H2O) and the epoxide is weak and, now, the regioselectivity is governed by the activation strain. Protonation of the epoxide induces elongation of the weaker (CH3)2C\u03b1\u2013O bond, and effectively predistorts the substrate for the attack at the sterically more hindered side, which goes with a less destabilizing overall strain energy. Our quantitative analysis significantly builds on the widely accepted rationales behind the regioselectivity of these ring-opening reactions and provide a concrete framework for understanding these indispensable textbook reactions."

  "description": "The energetic basis of population growth in animal kingdomPopulation growth, and other population characteristics, have been computed and made available online for over 2000 animal species in the Add-my-Pet (AmP) collection, assuming constant food and temperature environments. The AmP collection \u2013 online database of Dynamic Energy Budget model parameters, implied properties and referenced underlying data \u2013 provides an unique opportunity to study how energetics of individuals relates to population growth. For the comparisons of traits, we assume that the background hazard rate is zero, but aging applies to all species and \u2018thinning\u2019 to species with high reproduction rates. The new concept \u2018thinning\u2019 is a state-dependent hazard rate such that the feeding rate of a cohort does not change in time: the increase of individual feeding rates due to growth is exactly compensated by a reduction in numbers. Thinning affects population growth rate, but the impact differs substantially between species. Some 11% of species do not survive thinning, even at abundant food. The population growth rate relates to the underlying energetics; we discuss and suggest explanations for how population growth rates fit into all known patterns in the co-variation of parameter values: body size-scaling, metabolic acceleration, waste-to-hurry, supply-demand spectrum and altricial-precocial spectrum. We show that, after reproduction, age at puberty dominates population growth. The specific population growth rate scales with maximum body weight in the same way as the weight-specific respiration scales with body weight. DEB theory, which explains both, shows, however, that no direct relationship exists between the population growth rate and respiration. We suggest that the similarity in scaling results from the equality between specific population growth and specific growth rate at maximum growth of structure, and might be an evolutionary relict from times that life consisted of dividing unicellulars; population and body growth are directly connected for unicellulars. We show that the specific growth rate at maximum growth equals 1.5 times the von Bertalanffy growth rate, in a DEB context, which is a new interpretation of the latter growth rate. We expected the population growth rate to co-vary with specific somatic maintenance rate, based on a previously discovered pattern, called the waste-to-hurry strategy, where growth and reproduction are increased by simultaneously increasing assimilation and somatic maintenance in species that live off temporarily abundant food supplies. We did find this effect in ecdysozoa and spiralia, which comprise roughly 95% of animal species, but hardly so in tetrapods. The reason might be that specific somatic maintenance also co-varies with specific maturity levels at puberty for tetrapods. The scaled functional response at which the population growth rate is zero is very close to that at which puberty can just be reached in absence of thinning, and somewhat higher in presence of thinning. The specific population growth rate at abundant food correlates negatively with the functional response for which population growth rate is zero. It also correlates negatively with the precociality index, i.e. the ratio of maturity levels at puberty and birth: the more precocial, the larger neonate size, the smaller reproduction rate, especially in restricted taxa such as mammals and cartilaginous fish. Like other traits, the population growth rate shows considerable segregation among taxa, where mammals have a relatively low rate, glires a relatively high rate among mammals, followed by marsupials; afrotherians have the lowest population growth rates."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

  "description": "Biosignature Analysis of Mars Soil Analogs from the Atacama Desert: Challenges and Implications for Future Missions to MarsThe detection of biosignatures on Mars is of outstanding interest in the current field of astrobiology and drives various fields of research, ranging from new sample collection strategies to the development of more sensitive detection techniques. Detailed analysis of the organic content in Mars analog materials collected from extreme environments on Earth improves the current understanding of biosignature preservation and detection under conditions similar to those of Mars. In this article, we examined the biological fingerprint of several locations in the Atacama Desert (Chile), which include different wet and dry, and intermediate to high elevation salt flats (also named salars). Liquid chromatography and multidimensional gas chromatography mass spectrometry measurement techniques were used for the detection and analysis of amino acids extracted from the salt crusts and sediments by using sophisticated extraction procedures. Illumina 16S amplicon sequencing was used for the identification of microbial communities associated with the different sample locations. Although amino acid load and organic carbon and nitrogen quantities were generally low, it was found that most of the samples harbored complex and versatile microbial communities, which were dominated by (extremely) halophilic microorganisms (most notably by species of the Archaeal family Halobacteriaceae). The dominance of salts (i.e., halites and sulfates) in the investigated samples leaves its mark on the composition of the microbial communities but does not appear to hinder the potential of life to flourish since it can clearly adapt to the higher concentrations. Although the Atacama Desert is one of the driest and harshest environments on Earth, it is shown that there are still sub-locations where life is able to maintain a foothold, and, as such, salt flats could be considered as interesting targets for future life exploration missions on Mars."

  "description": "Mechanism of biomolecular recognition of trimethyllysine by the fluorinated aromatic cage of KDM5A PHD3 fingerThe understanding of biomolecular recognition of posttranslationally modified histone proteins is centrally important to the histone code hypothesis. Despite extensive binding and structural studies on the readout of histones, the molecular language by which posttranslational modifications on histone proteins are read remains poorly understood. Here we report physical-organic chemistry studies on the recognition of the positively charged trimethyllysine by the electron-rich aromatic cage containing PHD3 finger of KDM5A. The aromatic character of two tryptophan residues that solely constitute the aromatic cage of KDM5A was fine-tuned by the incorporation of fluorine substituents. Our thermodynamic analyses reveal that the wild-type and fluorinated KDM5A PHD3 fingers associate equally well with trimethyllysine. This work demonstrates that the biomolecular recognition of trimethyllysine by fluorinated aromatic cages is associated with weaker cation\u2013\u03c0 interactions that are compensated by the energetically more favourable trimethyllysine-mediated release of high-energy water molecules that occupy the aromatic cage."

  "description": "The ENDpoiNTs project: Novel testing strategies for endocrine disruptors linked to developmental neurotoxicityUbiquitous exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has caused serious concerns about the ability of these chemicals to affect neurodevelopment, among others. Since endocrine disruption (ED)-induced developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) is hardly covered by the chemical testing tools that are currently in regulatory use, the Horizon 2020 research and innovation action ENDpoiNTs has been launched to fill the scientific and methodological gaps related to the assessment of this type of chemical toxicity. The ENDpoiNTs project will generate new knowledge about ED-induced DNT and aims to develop and improve in vitro, in vivo, and in silico models pertaining to ED-linked DNT outcomes for chemical testing. This will be achieved by establishing correlative and causal links between known and novel neurodevelopmental endpoints and endocrine pathways through integration of molecular, cellular, and organismal data from in vitro and in vivo models. Based on this knowledge, the project aims to provide adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for ED-induced DNT and to develop and integrate new testing tools with high relevance for human health into European and international regulatory frameworks."

  "description": "Development of high-throughput screening assays for profiling snake venom phospholipase A2 activity after chromatographic fractionationMany organisms, ranging from plants to mammals, contain phospholipase A2 enzymes (PLA2s), which catalyze the production of lysophospholipids and fatty acid proinflammatory mediators. PLA2s are also common constituents of animal venoms, including bees, scorpions and snakes, and they cause a wide variety of toxic effects including neuro-, myo-, cyto-, and cardio-toxicity, anticoagulation and edema. The aim of this study was to develop a generic method for profiling enzymatically active PLA2s in snake venoms after chromatographic separation. For this, low-volume high-throughput assays for assessment of enzymatic PLA2 activity were evaluated and optimized. Subsequently, the assays were incorporated into a nanofractionation platform that combines high-resolution fractionation of crude venoms by liquid chromatography (LC) with bioassaying in 384-well plate format, and parallel mass spectrometric (MS) detection for toxin identification. The miniaturized assays developed are based on absorbance or fluorescence detection (respectively, using cresol red or fluorescein as pH indicators) to monitor the pH drop associated with free fatty acid formation by enzymatically active PLA2s. The methodology was demonstrated for assessment of PLA2 activity profiles of venoms from the snake species Bothrops asper, Echis carinatus, Echis coloratus, Echis ocellatus, Oxyuranus scutellatus and Daboia russelii russelii."

  "description": "Unary Words Have the Smallest Levenshtein k-NeighbourhoodsThe edit distance (a.k.a. the Levenshtein distance) between two words is defined as the minimum number of insertions, deletions or substitutions of letters needed to transform one word into another. The Levenshtein k-neighbourhood of a word w is the set of words that are at edit distance at most k from w. This is perhaps the most important concept underlying BLAST, a widely-used tool for comparing biological sequences. A natural combinatorial question is to ask for upper and lower bounds on the size of this set. The answer to this question has important algorithmic implications as well. Myers notes that \"such bounds would give a tighter characterisation of the running time of the algorithm\" behind BLAST. We show that the size of the Levenshtein k-neighbourhood of any word of length n over an arbitrary alphabet is not smaller than the size of the Levenshtein k-neighbourhood of a unary word of length n, thus providing a tight lower bound on the size of the Levenshtein k-neighbourhood. We remark that this result was posed as a conjecture by Dufresne at WCTA 2019. 2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation ! Pattern matching."

  "description": "Recent Developments in Linear Interaction Energy Based Binding Free Energy CalculationsThe linear interaction energy (LIE) approach is an end\u2013point method to compute binding affinities. As such it combines explicit conformational sampling (of the protein-bound and unbound-ligand states) with efficiency in calculating values for the protein-ligand binding free energy \u0394Gbind. This perspective summarizes our recent efforts to use molecular simulation and empirically calibrated LIE models for accurate and efficient calculation of \u0394Gbind for diverse sets of compounds binding to flexible proteins (e.g., Cytochrome P450s and other proteins of direct pharmaceutical or biochemical interest). Such proteins pose challenges on \u0394Gbind computation, which we tackle using a previously introduced statistically weighted LIE scheme. Because calibrated LIE models require empirical fitting of scaling parameters, they need to be accompanied with an applicability domain (AD) definition to provide a measure of confidence for predictions for arbitrary query compounds within a reference frame defined by a collective chemical and interaction space. To enable AD assessment of LIE predictions (or other protein-structure and -dynamic based \u0394Gbind calculations) we recently introduced strategies for AD assignment of LIE models, based on simulation and training data only. These strategies are reviewed here as well, together with available tools to facilitate and/or automate LIE computation (including software for combined statistically-weighted LIE calculations and AD assessment)."

  "description": "Advancements in effect-based surface water quality assessmentLegally-prescribed chemical monitoring is unfit for determining the pollution status of surface waters, and there is a need for improved assessment methods that consider the aggregated risk of all bioavailable micropollutants present in the aquatic environment. Therefore, the present study aimed to advance effect-based water quality assessment by implementing methodological improvements and to gain insight into contamination source-specific bioanalytical responses. Passive sampling of non-polar and polar organic compounds and metals was applied at 14 surface water locations that were characterized by two major anthropogenic contamination sources, agriculture and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, as well as reference locations with a low expected impact from micropollutants. Departing from the experience gained in previous studies, a battery of 20 in vivo and in vitro bioassays was composed and subsequently exposed to the passive sampler extracts. Next, the bioanalytical responses were divided by their respective effect-based trigger values to obtain effect-based risk quotients, which were summed per location. These cumulative ecotoxicological risks were lowest for reference locations (4.3\u201310.9), followed by agriculture locations (11.3\u201327.2) and the highest for WWTP locations (12.8\u201347.7), and were mainly driven by polar organic contaminants. The bioanalytical assessment of the joint risks of metals and (non-)polar organic compounds resulted in the successful identification of pollution source-specific ecotoxicological risk profiles: none of the bioassays were significantly associated with reference locations nor with multiple location types, while horticulture locations were significantly characterized by anti-AR and anti-PR activity and cytotoxicity, and WWTP sites by ER\u03b1 activity and toxicity in the in vivo bioassays. It is concluded that the presently employed advanced effect-based methods can readily be applied in surface water quality assessment and that the integration of chemical- and effect-based monitoring approaches will foster future-proof water quality assessment strategies on the road to a non-toxic environment."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity. How to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine-disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine-disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower than S-EDCs. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea, and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

  "description": "Multiple low dose therapy as an effective strategy to treat EGFR inhibitor-resistant NSCLC tumoursResistance to targeted cancer drugs is thought to result from selective pressure exerted by a high drug dose. Partial inhibition of multiple components in the same oncogenic signalling pathway may add up to complete pathway inhibition, while decreasing the selective pressure on each component to acquire a resistance mutation. We report here testing of this Multiple Low Dose (MLD) therapy model in EGFR mutant NSCLC. We show that as little as 20% of the individual effective drug doses is sufficient to completely block MAPK signalling and proliferation when used in 3D (RAF\u2009+\u2009MEK\u2009+\u2009ERK) or 4D (EGFR\u2009+\u2009RAF\u2009+\u2009MEK\u2009+\u2009ERK) inhibitor combinations. Importantly, EGFR mutant NSCLC cells treated with MLD therapy do not develop resistance. Using several animal models, we find durable responses to MLD therapy without associated toxicity. Our data support the notion that MLD therapy could deliver clinical benefit, even for those having acquired resistance to third generation EGFR inhibitor therapy."

  "description": "Functions of paralogous RNA polymerase III subunits POLR3G and POLR3GL in mouse developmentMammalian cells contain two isoforms of RNA polymerase III (Pol III) that differ in only a single subunit, with POLR3G in one form (Pol III\u03b1) and the related POLR3GL in the other form (Pol III\u03b2). Previous research indicates that POLR3G and POLR3GL are differentially expressed, with POLR3G expression being highly enriched in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and tumor cells relative to the ubiquitously expressed POLR3GL. To date, the functional differences between these two subunits remain largely unexplored, especially in vivo. Here, we show that POLR3G and POLR3GL containing Pol III complexes bind the same target genes and assume the same functions both in vitro and in vivo and, to a significant degree, can compensate for each other in vivo. Notably, an observed defect in the differentiation ability of POLR3G knockout ESCs can be rescued by exogenous expression of POLR3GL. Moreover, whereas POLR3G knockout mice die at a very early embryonic stage, POLR3GL knockout mice complete embryonic development without noticeable defects but die at about 3 wk after birth with signs of both general growth defects and potential cerebellum-related neuronal defects. The different phenotypes of the knockout mice likely reflect differential expression levels of POLR3G and POLR3GL across developmental stages and between tissues and insufficient amounts of total Pol III in vivo."

  "description": "Development of a Conformational Histamine H3Receptor Biosensor for the Synchronous Screening of Agonists and Inverse AgonistsThe histamine H3 receptor (H3R) represents a highly attractive drug target for the treatment of various central nervous system disorders, but the discovery of novel H3R targeting compounds relies on the assessment of highly amplified intracellular signaling events that do not only reflect H3R modulation and carry the risk of high false-positive and -negative screening rates. To address these limitations, we designed an intramolecular H3R biosensor based on the principle of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) that reports the receptor's real-time conformational dynamics and provides an advanced tool to screen for both H3R agonists and inverse agonists in a live cell screening-compatible assay format. This conformational G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) sensor allowed us to characterize the pharmacological properties of known and new H3 receptor ligands with unprecedented accuracy. Interestingly, we found that one newly developed H3 receptor ligand possesses even stronger inverse agonistic activity than reference H3R inverse agonists including the current gold standard pitolisant. Taken together, we describe here the design and validation of the first screening-compatible H3R conformational biosensor that will aid in the discovery of novel H3R ligands and can be employed to gain deeper insights into the (in-)activation mechanism of this highly attractive drug target.

Their small size allows for easy genetic manipulation of the nanobody sequence to incorporate protein tags, facilitating their use as biochemical probes. The nanobody VUN400, which recognizes the second extracellular loop of the human CXCR4 chemokine receptor, was used as a probe to monitor specific CXCR4 conformations. VUN400 was fused via its C terminus to the 11-amino-acid HiBiT tag (VUN400-HiBiT) which complements LgBiT protein, forming a full-length functional NanoLuc luciferase. Here, complemented luminescence was used to detect VUN400-HiBiT binding to CXCR4 receptors expressed in living HEK293 cells. VUN400-HiBiT binding to CXCR4 could be prevented by orthosteric and allosteric ligands, allowing VUN400-HiBiT to be used as a probe to detect allosteric interactions with CXCR4. These data demonstrate that the high specificity offered by extracellular targeted nanobodies can be utilized to probe receptor pharmacology."

  "description": "Multiparametric assessment of mitochondrial respiratory inhibition in HepG2 and RPTEC/TERT1 cells using a panel of mitochondrial targeting agrochemicalsEvidence is mounting for the central role of mitochondrial dysfunction in several pathologies including metabolic diseases, accelerated ageing, neurodegenerative diseases and in certain xenobiotic-induced organ toxicity. Assessing mitochondrial perturbations is not trivial and the outcomes of such investigations are dependent on the cell types used and assays employed. Here we systematically investigated the effect of electron transport chain (ETC) inhibitors on multiple mitochondrial-related parameters in two human cell types, HepG2 and RPTEC/TERT1. Cells were exposed to a broad range of concentrations of 20 ETC-inhibiting agrochemicals and capsaicin, consisting of inhibitors of NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I, CI), succinate dehydrogenase (Complex II, CII) and cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III, CIII). A battery of tests was utilised, including viability assays, lactate production, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the Seahorse bioanalyser, which simultaneously measures extracellular acidification rate [ECAR] and oxygen consumption rate [OCR]. CI inhibitors caused a potent decrease in OCR, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased ECAR and increased lactate production in both cell types. Twenty-fourhour exposure to CI inhibitors decreased viability of RPTEC/TERT1 cells and 3D spheroid-cultured HepG2 cells in the presence of glucose. CI inhibitors decreased 2D HepG2 viability only in the absence of glucose. CII inhibitors had no notable effects in intact cells up to 10 \u00b5M. CIII inhibitors had similar effects to the CI inhibitors. Antimycin A was the most potent CIII inhibitor, with activity in the nanomolar range. The proposed CIII inhibitor cyazofamid demonstrated a mitochondrial uncoupling signal in both cell types. The study presents a comprehensive example of a mitochondrial assessment workflow and establishes measurable key events of ETC inhibition."

  "description": "Human exposure to synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) is generally negligible as compared to natural compounds with higher or comparable endocrine activity: how to evaluate the risk of the S-EDCs?Theoretically, both synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (S-EDCs) and natural (exogenous and endogenous) endocrine disrupting chemicals (N-EDCs) can interact with endocrine receptors and disturb hormonal balance. However, compared to endogenous hormones, S-EDCs are only weak partial agonists with receptor affinities several orders of magnitude lower. Thus, to elicit observable effects, S-EDCs require considerably higher concentrations to attain sufficient receptor occupancy or to displace natural hormones and other endogenous ligands. Significant exposures to exogenous N-EDCs may result from ingestion of foods such as soy-based diets, green tea and sweet mustard. While their potencies are lower as compared to natural endogenous hormones, they usually are considerably more potent than S-EDCs. Effects of exogenous N-EDCs on the endocrine system were observed at high dietary intakes. A causal relation between their mechanism of action and these effects is established and biologically plausible. In contrast, the assumption that the much lower human exposures to S-EDCs may induce observable endocrine effects is not plausible. Hence, it is not surprising that epidemiological studies searching for an association between S-EDC exposure and health effects have failed. Regarding testing for potential endocrine effects, a scientifically justified screen should use in vitro tests to compare potencies of S-EDCs with those of reference N-EDCs. When the potency of the S-EDC is similar or smaller than that of the N-EDC, further testing in laboratory animals and regulatory consequences are not warranted."

To this end, the effect of different donor and \u03c0-bridge moieties on the energy gaps between local and charge-transfer singlet and triplet states is examined. To prove this computationally aided design concept, the D-\u03c0-B(FXyl)2 compounds 1\u20135 were synthesized and fully characterized. The photophysical properties of these compounds in various solvents, polymeric film, and in a frozen matrix were investigated in detail and show excellent agreement with the computationally obtained data. Furthermore, a simple structure\u2013property relationship is presented on the basis of the molecular fragment orbitals of the donor and the \u03c0-bridge, which minimize the relevant singlet\u2013triplet gaps to achieve efficient TADF emitters."

  "description": "New Generations of MS2 Variants and MCP Fusions to Detect Single mRNAs in Living Eukaryotic CellsLive imaging of single RNA from birth to death brought important advances in our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. These studies have provided a comprehensive understanding of RNA metabolism by describing the process step by step. Most of these studies used for live imaging a genetically encoded RNA-tagging system fused to fluorescent proteins. One of the best characterized RNA-tagging systems is derived from the bacteriophage MS2 and it allows single RNA imaging in real-time and live cells. This system has been successfully used to track the different steps of mRNA processing in many living organisms. The recent development of optimized MS2 and MCP variants now allows the labeling of endogenous RNAs and their imaging without modifying their behavior. In this chapter, we discuss the improvements in detecting single mRNAs with different variants of MCP and fluorescent proteins that we tested in yeast and mammalian cells. Moreover, we describe protocols using MS2-MCP systems improved for real-time imaging of single mRNAs and transcription dynamics in S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells, respectively."

  "description": "Simultaneous Detection of mRNA and Protein in S. cerevisiae by Single-Molecule FISH and ImmunofluorescenceSingle-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) enables the detection and quantification of endogenous mRNAs within intact fixed cells. This method utilizes tens of singly labeled fluorescent DNA probes hybridized against the mRNA of interest, which can be detected by using standard wide-field fluorescence microscopy. This approach provides the means to generate absolute quantifications of gene expression within single cells, which can be used to link molecular fluctuations to phenotypes. To be able to correlate the expression of an mRNA and a protein of interest in individual cells, we combined smFISH with immunofluorescence (IF) in yeast cells. Here, we present our smFISH-IF protocol to visualize and quantify two cell cycle-controlled mRNAs (CLN2 and ASH1) and the cell cycle marker alpha-tubulin in S. cerevisiae. This protocol, which is performed over 2days, can be used to visualize up to three colors at the time (i.e., two mRNAs, one protein). Even if the described protocol is designed for S. cerevisiae, we think that the considerations discussed here can be useful to develop and troubleshoot smFISH-IF protocols for other model organisms."

  "description": "Acetylene containing cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Tyr)-analogs as mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP121A1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosisTuberculosis (TB) is a globally significant infective disease that is caused by a single infectious agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Because of the rise in the number of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB strains, identification of alternative drug targets for the development of drugs with different mechanism of actions is desired. CYP121A1, one of the twenty cytochrome P450 enzymes encoded in the Mtb genome, was previously shown to be essential for bacterial growth. This enzyme catalyzes the intramolecular C\u2013C crosslinking reaction of the cyclopeptide cyclo(L-tyr-L-tyr) (cYY) yielding the metabolite mycocyclosin. In the present study, acetylene-substituted cYY-analogs were synthesized and evaluated as potential mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP121A1. The acetylene-substituted cYY-analogs were capable of binding to CYP121A1 with affinities comparable with cYY, and exhibited a Type I binding mode, indicative of a substrate-like binding, mandatory for metabolism. Only the cYY-analogs which contain an acetylene-substitution at one (2a) or both (3) para-positions of cYY showed mechanism-based inhibition of CYP121A1 activity. The values of KI and kinact were 236 \u00b5M and 0.045 min\u22121, respectively, for compound 2a, and 145 \u00b5M and 0.015 min\u22121, repectively, for compound 3 The inactivation could neither be reversed by dialysis nor be prevented by including glutathione. LC-MS analysis demonstrated that the inactivation results from covalent binding to the apoprotein, whereas the heme was unmodified. Interestingly, the mass increment of the CYP121A1 apoprotein was significantly smaller than was expected from the ketene formed by oxidation of the acetylene-group, indicative for a secondary cleavage reaction in the active site of CYP121A1. Although the two acetylene-containing cYY-analogs showed significant mechanism-based inhibition, growth inhibition of the Mtb strains was only observed at millimolar concentrations. This low efficacy may be due to insufficient irreversible inactivation of CYP121A1 and/or insufficient cellular uptake. Although the identified mechanism-based inhibitors have no perspective for Mtb-treatment, this study is the first proof-of-principle that mechanism-based inhibition of CYP121A1 is feasible and may provide the basis for new strategies in the design and development of compounds against this promising therapeutic target."

  "description": "Fragmentation of plastic objects in a laboratory seawater microcosmWe studied the fragmentation of conventional thermoplastic and compostable plastic items in a laboratory seawater microcosm. In the microcosm, polyurethane foams, cellulose acetate cigarette filters, and compostable polyester and polylactic acid items readily sank, whereas polyethylene air pouches, latex balloons, polystyrene foams and polypropylene cups remained afloat. Microbial biofilms dominated by Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Bacteriodetes grew on the plastics, and caused some of the polyethylene items to sink to the bottom. Electrical resistances (ER) of plastic items decreased as function of time, an indication that seawater had penetrated into microscopic crevices in the plastic that had developed over time. Rate constants for ER decrease in polyethylene items in the microcosm were similar to tensile elongation decrease of polyethylene sheets floating in sea, measured previously by others. Weight loss of plastic items was \u2264 1% per year for polyethylene, polystyrene and polypropylene, 3\u20135% for latex, polyethylene terephthalate and polyurethane, 15% for cellulose acetate, and 7\u201327% for polyester and polylactic acid compostable bags. The formation of microplastics observed in the microcosm was responsible for at least part of the weight loss. This study emphasizes the need to obtain experimental data on plastic litter degradation under conditions that are realistic for marine environments."

  "description": "Learning strategies in sustainable energy demonstration projects: What organizations learn from sustainable energy demonstrationsThis literature review study presents and discusses the learning strategies of organizations participating in sustainable energy demonstration projects. It finds that academic, commercial, and governmental organizations build on six major learning strategies. The first learning strategy is to capture intellectual property and benefit from knowledge spillovers. The second learning strategy comprises the building of a series of prototypes that are technically and commercially fit for purpose. The third learning strategy aims at operating production plants that produce the prototypes on a large scale. The fourth learning strategy concentrates on exploiting learning curves in these production plants. The fifth learning strategy focuses on creating supply-demand networks that serve increasing markets. Finally, the sixth learning strategy is to develop governmental regulation and funding schemes that support the emergence of an industrial and societal institutional infrastructure for sustainable energy technology, based on the lessons learned from the demonstration projects. This study also finds that the six learning strategies are facilitated by four key behaviors of participants in demonstration projects, which are mutual trust-building, decision-making in favor of sustainable energy technology, learning-network building, and demonstration program development. To academics, this study provides a comprehensive insight into organizations\u2019 learning strategies in sustainable energy demonstration projects, regarding learning directions and outcomes. Its contribution to practice is that it supports academic, commercial, and governmental organizations in managing their portfolio of learning strategies in new sustainable energy demonstration projects."

  "description": "The EU-ToxRisk method documentation, data processing and chemical testing pipeline for the regulatory use of new approach methodsHazard assessment, based on new approach methods (NAM), requires the use of batteries of assays, where individual tests may be contributed by different laboratories. A unified strategy for such collaborative testing is presented. It details all procedures required to allow test information to be usable for integrated hazard assessment, strategic project decisions and/or for regulatory purposes. The EU-ToxRisk project developed a strategy to provide regulatorily valid data, and exemplified this using a panel of\u2009>\u200920 assays (with\u2009>\u200950 individual endpoints), each exposed to 19 well-known test compounds (e.g. rotenone, colchicine, mercury, paracetamol, rifampicine, paraquat, taxol). Examples of strategy implementation are provided for all aspects required to ensure data validity: (i) documentation of test methods in a publicly accessible database; (ii) deposition of standard operating procedures (SOP) at the European Union DB-ALM repository; (iii) test readiness scoring accoding to defined criteria; (iv) disclosure of the pipeline for data processing; (v) link of uncertainty measures and metadata to the data; (vi) definition of test chemicals, their handling and their behavior in test media; (vii) specification of the test purpose and overall evaluation plans. Moreover, data generation was exemplified by providing results from 25 reporter assays. A complete evaluation of the entire test battery will be described elsewhere. A major learning from the retrospective analysis of this large testing project was the need for thorough definitions of the above strategy aspects, ideally in form of a study pre-registration, to allow adequate interpretation of the data and to ensure overall scientific/toxicological validity."

  "description": "Putative adverse outcome pathways for female reproductive disorders to improve testing and regulation of chemicalsModern living challenges female reproductive health. We are witnessing a rise in reproductive disorders and drop in birth rates across the world. The reasons for these manifestations are multifaceted and most likely include continuous exposure to an ever-increasing number of chemicals. The cause\u2013effect relationships between chemical exposure and female reproductive disorders, however, have proven problematic to determine. This has made it difficult to assess the risks chemical exposures pose to a woman\u2019s reproductive development and function. To address this challenge, this review uses the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept to summarize current knowledge about how chemical exposure can affect female reproductive health. We have a special focus on effects on the ovaries, since they are essential for lifelong reproductive health in women, being the source of both oocytes and several reproductive hormones, including sex steroids. The AOP framework is widely accepted as a new tool for toxicological safety assessment that enables better use of mechanistic knowledge for regulatory purposes. AOPs equip assessors and regulators with a pragmatic network of linear cause\u2013effect relationships, enabling the use of a wider range of test method data in chemical risk assessment and regulation. Based on current knowledge, we propose ten putative AOPs relevant for female reproductive disorders that can be further elaborated and potentially be included in the AOPwiki. This effort is an important step towards better safeguarding the reproductive health of all girls and women."

  "description": "Assessing anti-estrogenic effects of AHR ligands in primary human and rat endometrial epithelial cellsUnopposed estrogenic action in the uterus can lead to the development of endometrial cancer in both humans and rats. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) activation gives rise to anti-estrogenic actions and may consequently reduce the development of endometrial cancer. In this study, the anti-estrogenic potential of the AHR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and DELAQ, a metabolite of the pharmaceutical laquinimod, was assessed in in primary human and rat endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) with and without co-exposure to endogenous hormones. In human EECs, estradiol and progesterone did not affect AHR gene expression, but in rat EECs, progesterone decreased Ahre xpression (1.4-fold). In accordance, AHR-mediated induction of Cyp1a1/1b1 expression by DELAQ and TCDD decreased in hormone-treated rat EECs. DELAQ was 22-fold more potent than TCDD in human EECs in inducing CYP1A1/1B1 gene expression, while DELAQ was approximately 16\u221233-fold less potent than TCDD in rat EECs. In human EECs, 10 nM DELAQ decreased estradiol-induced expression of growth-regulated estrogen receptor binding 1 (GREB1) by 1.8-fold. In rat EECs, both DELAQ and TCDD did not affect the expression of estradiol-induced genes. This study shows that AHR ligand DELAQ, but not TCDD, causes anti-estrogenic effects in primary human EECs. Furthermore, although AHR-mediated CYP1A1/1B1/Cyp1a1/1b1 induction by DELAQ and TCDD was stronger in rat EECs than human EECs, this did not result in apparent anti-estrogenic effects in the rat cells. This study shows that primary human and rat endometrial cells respond differently towards hormones and AHR ligands. This should be considered in human risk assessment based on rodent studies."

  "description": "The CTD Is Not Essential for the Post-Initiation Control of RNA Polymerase II ActivityInterest in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) has been revived in recent years, owing to its numerous posttranslational modifications and its \u201cphase-separation\u201d properties. A large number of studies have shown that the status of CTD modifications is associated with the activity of Pol II during the transcription cycle. However, because this domain is essential in living cells, the functional requirement of the full CTD for the control of Pol II activity at endogenous mammalian genes has never been addressed directly in living cells. Using an inducible Pol II-degradation system that we previously established, we investigated here the roles of the CTD in the post-initiation control of Pol II. The selective ablation of the RPB1 CTD, post-initiation, at promoter-proximal pause-sites revealed that this domain, and by extension the CTD heptads and their modifications, is functionally neither absolutely required to maintain pausing in the absence of CDK9 activity nor essential for the release of Pol II into productive elongation."

  "description": "High resolution effect-directed analysis of steroid hormone (ant)agonists in surface and wastewater quality monitoringMonitoring of chemical water quality is extremely challenging due to the large variety of compounds and the presence of biologically active compounds with unknown chemical identity. Previously, we developed a high resolution Effect-Directed Analysis (EDA) platform that combines liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry and parallel bioassay detection. In this study, the platform is combined with CALUX bioassays for (anti)androgenic, estrogenic and glucocorticoid activities, and the performance of the platform is evaluated. It appeared to render very repeatable results, with high recoveries of spiked compounds and high consistency between the mass spectrometric and bioassay results. Application of the platform to wastewater treatment plant effluent and surface water samples led to the identification of several compounds contributing to the measured activities. Eventually, a workflow is proposed for the application of the platform in a routine monitoring context. The workflow divides the platform into four phases, of which one to all can be performed depending on the research question and the results obtained. This allows one to make a balance between the effort put into the platform and the certainty and depth by which active compounds will be identified. The EDA platform is a valuable tool to identify unknown bioactive compounds, both in an academic setting as in the context of legislative, governmental or routine monitoring."

  "description": "Time integrative sampling properties of Speedisk and silicone rubber passive samplers determined by chemical analysis and in vitro bioassay testingCompared to grab samples, passive samplers have the advantage that they sample over a longer time period and can detect lower compound concentrations in water quality monitoring campaigns. To allow the determination of time-weighted average concentrations, however, sampler uptake should remain linear in time over the entire sampling period. Therefore, the time integrative or linear uptake properties of adsorption-based Speedisks and partitioning-based silicone rubber samplers were assessed with respect to chemically analyzed single compounds and measured bioactivity in in vitro bioassays. Both sampler types were deployed in consecutive and overlapping time series in a WTTP effluent and in the river Meuse up to 105 days. Extracts were chemically analyzed for PCBs, PAHs and pesticides and tested in the Aliivibrio fischeri and DR-LUC bioassays. Speedisks showed time integrative sampling for the detected pesticides as well as for bioassay responses at both sampling locations for the entire sampling period. The silicone rubber samplers showed poor linear uptake in time for the unknown compounds causing bioassay responses. The bioassay results indicate that conversion of a bioassay response to a passive sampler extract into a time-weighted average bioactivity per liter water seems justified for Speedisks, confirming that concentrations in the samplers correspond to a single volume of sampled water for all compounds. The bioassay results also indicate that a similar conversion for silicone rubber extracts should be interpreted with caution. In principle, it is actually impossible, because the concentration of each compound contributing to the bioassay response corresponds to a different sampled water volume."

  "description": "Pesticide residue levels in vegetables and surface waters at the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of EthiopiaSeven pesticides, profenofos, metalaxyl, \u03bb-cyhalothrin, 4,4\u2032-DDT, 4,4\u2032-DDE, and \u03b1- and \u03b2-endosulfan, were determined in vegetables (tomato, onion) from 20 locations and surface waters from 12 locations in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia. Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) and solid phase extraction (SPE) methods were used for the vegetables and water, respectively. In 2.5% of the tomato samples, profenofos was detected above European maximum residue limits (MRLs), in 12.5% of the samples metalaxyl, and in 2.5% \u03b1- and \u03b2-endosulfan. In 5% of the onion samples, profenofos was detected above European MRLs, in 7.5% of the onion samples metalaxyl, and in 5% \u03bb-cyhalothrin. In surface water, profenofos was detected at the highest concentration of 2300 \u03bcg/L in the Bulbula River, 890 \u03bcg/L near the agricultural land north of Lake Ziway (ANLZ-1), 1700 \u03bcg/L in the floriculture effluent (FE-1), and 900 \u03bcg/L in tap water at the Batu Drinking Water (BDW) supply. These results show that the levels of pesticides are in several cases substantially elevated, and emphasize the need of regular pesticide monitoring programs for surface waters and vegetables in the Ethiopian CRV."

  "description": "A single-step preparation of carbohydrate functionalized monoliths for separation and trapping of polar compoundsA single-step copolymerization strategy was developed for the preparation of carbohydrate (glucose and maltose) functionalized monoliths using click reaction. Firstly, novel carbohydrate-functionalized methacrylate monomers were synthesized through Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (alkyne-azide reaction) of terminal alkyne with azide of carbohydrate derivatives. The corresponding carbohydrate functionalized monolithic columns were then prepared through a single-step in-situ copolymerization. The physicochemical properties and performance of the fabricated monolithic columns were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and nano-liquid chromatography. For the optimized monolithic column, satisfactory column permeability and good separation performance were demonstrated for polar compounds including nucleoside, phenolic compounds and benzoic acid derivatives. The monolithic column is also highly useful for selective and efficient enrichment of glycopeptides from human IgG tryptic digests. This study not only provided a novel hydrophilic column for separation and selective trapping of polar compounds, but also proposed a facile and efficient approach for preparing carbohydrate functionalized monoliths."
