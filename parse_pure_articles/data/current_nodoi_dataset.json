  "description": "Protein cost allocation explains metabolic strategies in Escherichia coliIn-depth understanding of microbial growth is crucial for the development of new advances in biotechnology and for combating microbial pathogens. Condition-specific proteome expression is central to microbial physiology and growth. A multitude of processes are dependent on the protein expression, thus, whole-cell analysis of microbial metabolism using genome-scale metabolic models is an attractive toolset to investigate the behaviour of microorganisms and their communities. However, genome-scale models that incorporate macromolecular expression are still inhibitory complex: the conceptual and computational complexity of these models severely limits their potential applications. In the need for alternatives, here we revisit some of the previous attempts to create genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression to develop a novel framework for integrating protein abundance and turnover costs to conventional genome-scale models. We show that such a model of Escherichia coli successfully reproduces experimentally determined adaptations of metabolism in a growth condition-dependent manner. Moreover, the model can be used as means of investigating underutilization of the protein machinery among different growth settings. Notably, we obtained strongly improved predictions of flux distributions, considering the costs of protein translation explicitly. This finding in turn suggests protein translation being the main regulation hub for cellular growth."

CEA is often overexpressed and released by many solid tumors, including colorectal carcinomas. CEA displays an impressive heterogeneity and variability in sugar content; however, site-specific distribution of carbohydrate structures has not been reported so far. The present study investigated CEA samples purified from human colon carcinoma and human liver metastases and enabled the characterization of 21 out of 28 potential N-glycosylation sites with respect to their occupancy. The coverage was achieved by a multienzymatic digestion approach with specific enzymes, such as trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and the nonspecific enzyme, Pronase, followed by analysis using sheathless CE-MS/MS. In total, 893 different N-glycopeptides and 128 unique N-glycan compositions were identified. Overall, a great heterogeneity was found both within (micro) and in between (macro) individual N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, notable differences were found on certain N-glycosylation sites between primary adenocarcinoma and metastatic tumor in regard to branching, bisection, sialylation, and fucosylation. Those features, if further investigated in a targeted manner, may pave the way toward improved diagnostics and monitoring of colorectal cancer progression and recurrence.

  "description": "Network medicine framework shows that proximity of polyphenol targets and disease proteins predicts therapeutic effects of polyphenolsPolyphenols, natural products present in plant-based foods, play a protective role against several complex diseases through their antioxidant activity and by diverse molecular mechanisms. Here we develop a network medicine framework to uncover mechanisms for the effects of polyphenols on health by considering the molecular interactions between polyphenol protein targets and proteins associated with diseases. We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighbourhoods of the human interactome, whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the molecule\u2019s known therapeutic effects. The methodology recovers known associations, such as the effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on type 2 diabetes, and predicts that rosmarinic acid has a direct impact on platelet function, representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health. We experimentally confirm that rosmarinic acid inhibits platelet aggregation and \u03b1-granule secretion through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, offering direct support for the predicted molecular mechanism. Our framework represents a starting point for mechanistic interpretation of the health effects underlying food-related compounds, allowing us to integrate into a predictive framework knowledge on food metabolism, bioavailability and drug interaction. Molecular interactions between polyphenol targets and proteins associated with disease are explored through a network medicine framework. The network proximity of polyphenol protein targets to disease proteins can predict therapeutic effects, highlighting more broadly the potential of network medicine as a tool for nutritional sciences."

It became clear that the inclusion of information to enhance discussions among this mix of participants would be even more valuable.

  "description": "Structure and dynamics of a mycobacterial typeVII secretion systemMycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of one of the most important infectious diseases in humans, which leads to 1.4 million deaths every year1. Specialized protein transport systems-known as type VII secretion systems (T7SSs)-are central to the virulence of this pathogen, and are also crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport across the mycobacterial cell envelope2,3. Here we present the structure of an intact T7SS inner-membrane complex of M. tuberculosis. We show how the 2.32-MDa ESX-5 assembly, which contains 165 transmembrane helices, is restructured and stabilized as a trimer of dimers by the MycP5 protease. A trimer of MycP5 caps a central periplasmic dome-like chamber that is formed by three EccB5 dimers, with the proteolytic sites of MycP5 facing towards the cavity. This chamber suggests a central secretion and processing conduit. Complexes without MycP5 show disruption of the EccB5 periplasmic assembly and increased flexibility, which highlights the importance of MycP5 for complex integrity. Beneath the EccB5-MycP5 chamber, dimers of the EccC5 ATPase assemble into three bundles of four transmembrane helices each, which together seal the potential central secretion channel. Individual cytoplasmic EccC5 domains adopt two distinctive conformations that probably reflect different secretion states. Our work suggests a previously undescribed mechanism of protein transport and provides a structural scaffold to aid in the development of drugs against this major human pathogen."

  "description": "FRET Analysis of RNA -Protein Interactions Using Spinach AptamersThe method development to analyze direct RNA-protein interaction is of high importance as not many homogeneous assay formats are available.The discovery of fluorescent light-up aptamers (FLAPs), short RNA aptamers that switch the fluorescence of small, cell-permeable, and nontoxic organic chromophores on, paved the road for their utilization in direct RNA -protein interactions. The combination with fluorescent proteins as biological fluorophores enabled the development of homogeneous assays that are in principle even encodable on genomic level.Here the rules and methods to design a homogeneous in vitro assay for the detection and quantification of a direct RNA -protein interaction will be described. The design and application of a homogeneous assay to observe and quantify the interaction of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage coat protein 7 (PP7) with its binding RNA sequence (pp7-RNA) will be shown. For this, the Spinach-DFHBI aptamer as RNA fusion and the red fluorescent mCherry as protein fusion was used.The methods presented here do not require any chemical modification of proteins or RNAs which make them relatively easy to use and to adopt on other systems. As all fluorophores are fusion tags to the according biomolecules, standard cloning strategies and molecular biology technologies are sufficient and make this method available for a broad community of researchers."

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.In cetaceans, blubber is the primary and largest lipid body reservoir. Our current understanding about lipid stores and uses in cetaceans is still limited, and most studies only focused on a single narrow snapshot of the lipidome. We documented an extended lipidomic fingerprint in two cetacean species present in northern Norway during wintertime. We were able to detect 817 molecular lipid species in blubber of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The profiles were largely dominated by triradylglycerols in both species and, to a lesser extent, by other constituents including glycerophosphocholines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and diradylglycerols. Through a unique combination of traditional statistical approaches, together with a novel bioinformatic tool (LION/web), we showed contrasting fingerprint composition between species. The higher content of triradylglycerols in humpback whales is necessary to fuel their upcoming half a year fasting and energy-demanding migration between feeding and breeding grounds. In adipocytes, we assume that the intense feeding rate of humpback whales prior to migration translates into an important accumulation of triacylglycerol content in lipid droplets. Upstream, the endoplasmic reticulum is operating at full capacity to supply acute lipid storage, consistent with the reported enrichment of glycerophosphocholines in humpback whales, major components of the endoplasmic reticulum. There was also an enrichment of membrane components, which translates into higher sphingolipid content in the lipidome of killer whales, potentially as a structural adaptation for their higher hydrodynamic performance. Finally, the presence of both lipid-enriched and lipid-depleted individuals within the killer whale population in Norway suggests dietary specialization, consistent with significant differences in \u03b415N and \u03b413C isotopic ratios in skin between the two groups, with higher values and a wider niche for the lipid-enriched individuals.

Cyanogen halide and halocyanoacetylene chains possess an extra stabilizing effect with increasing chain size, whereas the 4-halobenzonitrile chains do not. This cooperativity can be traced back to charge separation within the \u03c3-electronic system by charge-transfer between the lone-pair orbital of the nitrogen (\u03c3HOMO) on one unit and the acceptor orbital of the C\u2212X (\u03c3*LUMO) on the adjacent unit. As such, the HOMO-LUMO gap in the \u03c3-system decreases, and the cooperativity increases with chain length revealing the similarity in the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen and halogen bonds."

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) contributes to alveolar repair, but for its structural and functional homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) this is unknown. MIF mediates its effects through CD74 and/or C-X-C chemokine receptors 2 (CXCR2), 4(CXCR4), and possibly 7 (ACKR3). DDT can also signal through CD74, but interactions with other receptors have not been described yet. We therefore aimed at investigating if and how DDT contributes to epithelial repair in COPD. Methods: We studied effects of recombinant DDT on cell proliferation and survival by clonogenic assay and annexin V-PI staining respectively. DDT-induced signaling was investigated by Western blot. Effects on epithelial growth and differentiation was studied using lung organoid cultures with primary murine or human epithelial cells and incubating with DDT or an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. DDT-ACKR3 interactions were identified by ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation. Findings: We found that DDT promoted proliferation of and prevented staurosporine-induced apoptosis in A549 lung epithelial cells. Importantly, DDT also stimulated growth of primary alveolar epithelial cells as DDT treatment resulted in significantly more and larger murine and human alveolar organoids compared to untreated controls. The anti-apoptotic effect of DDT and DDT-induced organoid growth were inhibited in the presence of an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. Furthermore, ELISA assay and co-immunoprecipitation suggested DDT complexes with ACKR3. DDT could activate the PI3K-Akt pathway and this activation was enhanced in ACKR3-overexpressing cells. Interpretation: In conclusion, DDT contributes to alveolar epithelial repair via ACKR3 and may thus augment lung epithelial repair in COPD.General information",

  "description": "Reduced mGluR5 Activity Modulates Mitochondrial FunctionThe metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is an essential modulator of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory; whereas in pathological conditions, it is an acknowledged therapeutic target that has been implicated in multiple brain disorders. Despite robust pre-clinical data, mGluR5 antagonists failed in several clinical trials, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mGluR5 function. In this study, we dissected the molecular synaptic modulation mediated by mGluR5 using genetic and pharmacological mouse models to chronically and acutely reduce mGluR5 activity. We found that next to dysregulation of synaptic proteins, the major regulation in protein expression in both models concerned specific processes in mitochondria, such as oxidative phosphorylation. Second, we observed morphological alterations in shape and area of specifically postsynaptic mitochondria in mGluR5 KO synapses using electron microscopy. Third, computational and biochemical assays suggested an increase of mitochondrial function in neurons, with increased level of NADP/H and oxidative damage in mGluR5 KO. Altogether, our observations provide diverse lines of evidence of the modulation of synaptic mitochondrial function by mGluR5. This connection suggests a role for mGluR5 as a mediator between synaptic activity and mitochondrial function, a finding which might be relevant for the improvement of the clinical potential of mGluR5."

  "description": "New approach methods supporting read-across: Two neurotoxicity AOP-based IATA case studiesRead-across approaches are considered key in moving away from in vivo animal testing towards addressing data-gaps using new approach methods (NAMs). Ample successful examples are still required to substantiate this strategy. Here we present and discuss the learnings from two OECD IATA endorsed read-across case studies. They involve two classes of pesticides -rotenoids and strobilurins- each having a defined mode-of-action that is assessed for its neurological hazard by means of an AOP-based testing strategy coupled to toxicokinetic simulations of human tissue concentrations. The endpoint in question is potential mitochondrial respiratory chain mediated neurotoxicity, specifically through inhibition of complex I or III. An AOP linking inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons formed the basis for both cases, but was deployed in two different regulatory contexts. The two cases also exemplify several different read-across concepts: analogue versus category approach, consolidated versus putative AOP, positive versus negative prediction (i.e., neurotoxicity versus low potential for neurotoxicity), and structural versus biological similarity. We applied a range of NAMs to explore the toxicodynamic properties of the compounds, e.g., in silico docking as well as in vitro assays and readouts -including transcriptomics- in various cell systems, all anchored to the relevant AOPs. Interestingly, although some of the data addressing certain elements of the read-across were associated with high uncertainty, their impact on the overall read-across conclusion remained limited. Coupled to the elaborate regulatory review that the two cases underwent, we propose some generic learnings of AOP-based testing strategies supporting read-across."

Subsequent regio- and diastereoselective, inter- and intramolecular dipolar cycloaddition reactions with variously substituted electron-deficient alkenes enabled ready and efficient access to structurally complex pyrrolidine architectures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the dipolar cycloaddition reactions uncovered an intimate balance between asynchronicity and interaction energies of transition structures, which ultimately control the unusual selectivities observed in certain cases."

  "description": "Age-Dependent Hippocampal Proteomics in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer Mouse Model: A Comparative Analysis with Classical SWATH/DIA and directDIA ApproachesAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the human population, for which there is currently no cure. The cause of AD is unknown; however, the toxic effects of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) are believed to play a role in its onset. To investigate this, we examined changes in global protein levels in a hippocampal synaptosome fraction of the Amyloid Precursor Protein swe/Presenelin 1 dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD at 6 and 12 months of age (moa). Data independent acquisition (DIA), or Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical fragment-ion (SWATH), was used for a quantitative label-free proteomics analysis. We first assessed the usefulness of a recently improved directDIA workflow as an alternative to conventional DIA data analysis using a project-specific spectral library. Subsequently, we applied directDIA to the 6- and 12-moa APP/PS1 datasets and applied the Mass Spectrometry Downstream Analysis Pipeline (MS-DAP) for differential expression analysis and candidate discovery. We observed most regulation at 12-moa, in particular of proteins involved in A\u03b2 homeostasis and microglial-dependent processes, like synaptic pruning and the immune response, such as APOE, CLU and C1QA-C. All proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025777."

  "description": "Managing service innovations at online travel agencies: Evidence from ChinaPurposeResearch on service innovation management of online travel agencies (OTAs) remains relatively scarce. This study aims to illuminate the detailed components of managing service innovations at OTAs.Design/methodology/approachAn in-depth case study is conducted at Trip, the largest OTA in China. A coherent framework of managing service innovations at OTAs is proposed through refining an existing framework from new service development (NSD), and concerning the success factors of service innovation. Based on theoretical synthesis and empirical analysis, the NSD framework is adapted, restructured and refined for service innovation management at OTAs.FindingsThe proposed framework contains three facets and associated managerial elements: (1) resources, including stakeholders, technologies and systems; (2) contexts, including innovation strategy, structure and culture; and (3) ideation, including idea generation and idea application. Different success factors are attached to the managerial elements. The facets, managerial elements and success factors serve as the components in the framework.Research limitations/implicationsThis study provides academia with an analytical framework to understand and interpret service innovation management at OTAs, which can be used as a point of departure for future research.Practical implicationsThe analytical framework inspires OTA managers to adopt a structured approach in service innovation management, and policymakers to design related interventions.Originality/valueThis study offers a first step toward the investigation of service innovation management at OTAs, specifically in China. The proposed framework is potentially applicable to other industries.[With also Chinese summary, see DOI.]"

  "description": "Association of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants and children's behavior at a median age of 18 monthsExposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants (FRs) could have adverse effects on neurodevelopment in children. Some organophosphate (OPFRs) are used as alternatives for the phased-out decabromodiphenylether such as resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate (PBDPP) and bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate (BPA-BDPP). This study aims to investigate the relationship between indoor OPFR exposure and neurodevelopmental behavior in children. OPFRs were measured in house dust and hand wipes from 42 children, aged 8-16 months, from the LInking maternal Nutrition to Child health (LINC) study. At the median age of 18 months, the children's behavior was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, using three composite behavior scales: externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and total problems. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for maternal education and smoking by the partner. Children with higher BPA-BDPP, PBDPP, and tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) house dust concentrations were found to have higher scores on the behavioral problems scales. A 10-fold increase in BPA-BDPP and PBDPP concentration was associated with a 4.1 and 2.6 point increase on the internalizing problems scale (respectively p=0.004 and p=0.042). Increased BPA-BDPP concentrations were associated with elevated scores on the externalizing problems scale and total behavioral problems scale (respectively 7.6 and 16 points increase per 10-fold BPA-BDPP concentration increase, p=0.015 and p=0.007). TCEP dust concentrations were associated with the externalizing problems scale (13 point increase per 10-fold TCEP concentration increase, p=0.043). This study showed the importance of investigating the health effects of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants. Further research on neurodevelopmental health effects of OPFR exposure is warranted."

  "description": "How sticky are our proteins? Quantifying hydrophobicity of the human proteomeProteins tend to bury hydrophobic residues inside their core during the folding process to provide stability to the protein structure and to prevent aggregation. Nevertheless, proteins do expose some 'sticky' hydrophobic residues to the solvent. These residues can play an important functional role, for example in protein-protein and membrane interactions. Here, we investigate how hydrophobic protein surfaces are by providing three measures for surface hydrophobicity: the total hydrophobic surface area, the relative hydrophobic surface area, and - using our MolPatch method - the largest hydrophobic patch. Secondly, we analyse how difficult it is to predict these measures from sequence: by adapting solvent accessibility predictions from NetSurfP2.0, we obtain well-performing prediction methods for the THSA and RHSA, while predicting LHP is more difficult. Finally, we analyse implications of exposed hydrophobic surfaces: we show that hydrophobic proteins typically have low expression, suggesting cells avoid an overabundance of sticky proteins. "

These biogenic amines are known to raise vaginal pH, cause malodour, and make the environment more favourable to vaginal pathogens. In vitro experiments confirmed that strains isolated from women with a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota have higher antimicrobial effects against the common urogenital pathogens Escherichia coli and En-terococcus faecium. The results indicate that not all L. crispatus vaginal strains appear suitable for probiotic application and the basis for selection should not be only the overall composition of the vaginal microbiota of the host from which they came, but specific biochemical and genetic traits."

  "description": "Temporal transcriptomic alterations of cadmium exposed human iPSC-derived renal proximal tubule-like cellsCadmium is a well-studied environmental pollutant where the kidney and particularly the proximal tubule cells are especially sensitive as they are exposed to higher concentrations of cadmium than other tissues. Here we investigated the temporal transcriptomic alterations (TempO-Seq) of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived renal proximal tubule-like (PTL) cells exposed to 5 \u03bcM cadmium chloride for 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 72 and 168 h. There was an early activation (within 4 h) of the metal and oxidative stress responses (metal-responsive transcription factor-1 (MTF1) and nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) genes). The Nrf2 response returned to baseline within 24 h. The Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) regulated genes HSPA6 and FOSL-1 followed the Nrf2 time course. While the MTF1 genes also spiked at 4 h, they remained strongly elevated over the entire exposure period. The data and cell culture model utilised will be useful in further research aimed at the refinement of safe human exposure limits for cadmium, other metals and their mixtures."

  "description": "Managing service innovations at online travel agencies: Evidence from ChinaPurposeResearch on service innovation management of online travel agencies (OTAs) remains relatively scarce. This study aims to illuminate the detailed components of managing service innovations at OTAs.Design/methodology/approachAn in-depth case study is conducted at Trip, the largest OTA in China. A coherent framework of managing service innovations at OTAs is proposed through refining an existing framework from new service development (NSD), and concerning the success factors of service innovation. Based on theoretical synthesis and empirical analysis, the NSD framework is adapted, restructured and refined for service innovation management at OTAs.FindingsThe proposed framework contains three facets and associated managerial elements: (1) resources, including stakeholders, technologies and systems; (2) contexts, including innovation strategy, structure and culture; and (3) ideation, including idea generation and idea application. Different success factors are attached to the managerial elements. The facets, managerial elements and success factors serve as the components in the framework.Research limitations/implicationsThis study provides academia with an analytical framework to understand and interpret service innovation management at OTAs, which can be used as a point of departure for future research.Practical implicationsThe analytical framework inspires OTA managers to adopt a structured approach in service innovation management, and policymakers to design related interventions.Originality/valueThis study offers a first step toward the investigation of service innovation management at OTAs, specifically in China. The proposed framework is potentially applicable to other industries.[With also Chinese summary, see DOI.]"

This book aims to give an introduction into Structural Bioinformatics, which is where the previous topics meet to explore three dimensional protein structures through computational analysis. We provide an overview of existing computational techniques, to validate, simulate, predict and analyse protein structures. More importantly, it will aim to provide practical knowledge about how and when to use such techniques. We will consider proteins from three major vantage points: Protein structure quantification, Protein structure prediction, and Protein simulation & dynamics. The main emphasis of this work is to provide a background on experimental techniques for protein structure determination. The focus is set on X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR), which are by far the main methods used to determine the structure of soluble proteins. We will also introduce cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) and electron diffraction which are more suited to analyze membrane proteins and larger protein complexes. At the end, more qualitative techniques are summarized that are used to obtain insight on the overall structure and dynamics of proteins. Note that this introduction to protein structure determination aims at familiarizing the reader to different experimental techniques, their benefits and bottlenecks, but that a thorough mathematical and technical description of the concept is beyond the scope of this work."

  "description": "Association of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants and children's behavior at a median age of 18 monthsExposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants (FRs) could have adverse effects on neurodevelopment in children. Some organophosphate (OPFRs) are used as alternatives for the phased-out decabromodiphenylether such as resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate (PBDPP) and bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate (BPA-BDPP). This study aims to investigate the relationship between indoor OPFR exposure and neurodevelopmental behavior in children. OPFRs were measured in house dust and hand wipes from 42 children, aged 8-16 months, from the LInking maternal Nutrition to Child health (LINC) study. At the median age of 18 months, the children's behavior was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, using three composite behavior scales: externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and total problems. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for maternal education and smoking by the partner. Children with higher BPA-BDPP, PBDPP, and tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) house dust concentrations were found to have higher scores on the behavioral problems scales. A 10-fold increase in BPA-BDPP and PBDPP concentration was associated with a 4.1 and 2.6 point increase on the internalizing problems scale (respectively p=0.004 and p=0.042). Increased BPA-BDPP concentrations were associated with elevated scores on the externalizing problems scale and total behavioral problems scale (respectively 7.6 and 16 points increase per 10-fold BPA-BDPP concentration increase, p=0.015 and p=0.007). TCEP dust concentrations were associated with the externalizing problems scale (13 point increase per 10-fold TCEP concentration increase, p=0.043). This study showed the importance of investigating the health effects of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants. Further research on neurodevelopmental health effects of OPFR exposure is warranted."

  "description": "Progress towards an OECD reporting framework for transcriptomics and metabolomics in regulatory toxicology\u00a9 2021Omics methodologies are widely used in toxicological research to understand modes and mechanisms of toxicity. Increasingly, these methodologies are being applied to questions of regulatory interest such as molecular point-of-departure derivation and chemical grouping/read-across. Despite its value, widespread regulatory acceptance of omics data has not yet occurred. Barriers to the routine application of omics data in regulatory decision making have been: 1) lack of transparency for data processing methods used to convert raw data into an interpretable list of observations; and 2) lack of standardization in reporting to ensure that omics data, associated metadata and the methodologies used to generate results are available for review by stakeholders, including regulators. Thus, in 2017, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Extended Advisory Group on Molecular Screening and Toxicogenomics (EAGMST) launched a project to develop guidance for the reporting of omics data aimed at fostering further regulatory use. Here, we report on the ongoing development of the first formal reporting framework describing the processing and analysis of both transcriptomic and metabolomic data for regulatory toxicology. We introduce the modular structure, content, harmonization and strategy for trialling this reporting framework prior to its publication by the OECD."
