  "description": "Protein cost allocation explains metabolic strategies in Escherichia coliIn-depth understanding of microbial growth is crucial for the development of new advances in biotechnology and for combating microbial pathogens. Condition-specific proteome expression is central to microbial physiology and growth. A multitude of processes are dependent on the protein expression, thus, whole-cell analysis of microbial metabolism using genome-scale metabolic models is an attractive toolset to investigate the behaviour of microorganisms and their communities. However, genome-scale models that incorporate macromolecular expression are still inhibitory complex: the conceptual and computational complexity of these models severely limits their potential applications. In the need for alternatives, here we revisit some of the previous attempts to create genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression to develop a novel framework for integrating protein abundance and turnover costs to conventional genome-scale models. We show that such a model of Escherichia coli successfully reproduces experimentally determined adaptations of metabolism in a growth condition-dependent manner. Moreover, the model can be used as means of investigating underutilization of the protein machinery among different growth settings. Notably, we obtained strongly improved predictions of flux distributions, considering the costs of protein translation explicitly. This finding in turn suggests protein translation being the main regulation hub for cellular growth."

CEA is often overexpressed and released by many solid tumors, including colorectal carcinomas. CEA displays an impressive heterogeneity and variability in sugar content; however, site-specific distribution of carbohydrate structures has not been reported so far. The present study investigated CEA samples purified from human colon carcinoma and human liver metastases and enabled the characterization of 21 out of 28 potential N-glycosylation sites with respect to their occupancy. The coverage was achieved by a multienzymatic digestion approach with specific enzymes, such as trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and the nonspecific enzyme, Pronase, followed by analysis using sheathless CE-MS/MS. In total, 893 different N-glycopeptides and 128 unique N-glycan compositions were identified. Overall, a great heterogeneity was found both within (micro) and in between (macro) individual N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, notable differences were found on certain N-glycosylation sites between primary adenocarcinoma and metastatic tumor in regard to branching, bisection, sialylation, and fucosylation. Those features, if further investigated in a targeted manner, may pave the way toward improved diagnostics and monitoring of colorectal cancer progression and recurrence.

  "description": "Network medicine framework shows that proximity of polyphenol targets and disease proteins predicts therapeutic effects of polyphenolsPolyphenols, natural products present in plant-based foods, play a protective role against several complex diseases through their antioxidant activity and by diverse molecular mechanisms. Here we develop a network medicine framework to uncover mechanisms for the effects of polyphenols on health by considering the molecular interactions between polyphenol protein targets and proteins associated with diseases. We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighbourhoods of the human interactome, whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the molecule\u2019s known therapeutic effects. The methodology recovers known associations, such as the effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on type 2 diabetes, and predicts that rosmarinic acid has a direct impact on platelet function, representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health. We experimentally confirm that rosmarinic acid inhibits platelet aggregation and \u03b1-granule secretion through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, offering direct support for the predicted molecular mechanism. Our framework represents a starting point for mechanistic interpretation of the health effects underlying food-related compounds, allowing us to integrate into a predictive framework knowledge on food metabolism, bioavailability and drug interaction. Molecular interactions between polyphenol targets and proteins associated with disease are explored through a network medicine framework. The network proximity of polyphenol protein targets to disease proteins can predict therapeutic effects, highlighting more broadly the potential of network medicine as a tool for nutritional sciences."

It became clear that the inclusion of information to enhance discussions among this mix of participants would be even more valuable.

  "description": "Structure and dynamics of a mycobacterial typeVII secretion systemMycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of one of the most important infectious diseases in humans, which leads to 1.4 million deaths every year1. Specialized protein transport systems-known as type VII secretion systems (T7SSs)-are central to the virulence of this pathogen, and are also crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport across the mycobacterial cell envelope2,3. Here we present the structure of an intact T7SS inner-membrane complex of M. tuberculosis. We show how the 2.32-MDa ESX-5 assembly, which contains 165 transmembrane helices, is restructured and stabilized as a trimer of dimers by the MycP5 protease. A trimer of MycP5 caps a central periplasmic dome-like chamber that is formed by three EccB5 dimers, with the proteolytic sites of MycP5 facing towards the cavity. This chamber suggests a central secretion and processing conduit. Complexes without MycP5 show disruption of the EccB5 periplasmic assembly and increased flexibility, which highlights the importance of MycP5 for complex integrity. Beneath the EccB5-MycP5 chamber, dimers of the EccC5 ATPase assemble into three bundles of four transmembrane helices each, which together seal the potential central secretion channel. Individual cytoplasmic EccC5 domains adopt two distinctive conformations that probably reflect different secretion states. Our work suggests a previously undescribed mechanism of protein transport and provides a structural scaffold to aid in the development of drugs against this major human pathogen."

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.In cetaceans, blubber is the primary and largest lipid body reservoir. Our current understanding about lipid stores and uses in cetaceans is still limited, and most studies only focused on a single narrow snapshot of the lipidome. We documented an extended lipidomic fingerprint in two cetacean species present in northern Norway during wintertime. We were able to detect 817 molecular lipid species in blubber of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The profiles were largely dominated by triradylglycerols in both species and, to a lesser extent, by other constituents including glycerophosphocholines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and diradylglycerols. Through a unique combination of traditional statistical approaches, together with a novel bioinformatic tool (LION/web), we showed contrasting fingerprint composition between species. The higher content of triradylglycerols in humpback whales is necessary to fuel their upcoming half a year fasting and energy-demanding migration between feeding and breeding grounds. In adipocytes, we assume that the intense feeding rate of humpback whales prior to migration translates into an important accumulation of triacylglycerol content in lipid droplets. Upstream, the endoplasmic reticulum is operating at full capacity to supply acute lipid storage, consistent with the reported enrichment of glycerophosphocholines in humpback whales, major components of the endoplasmic reticulum. There was also an enrichment of membrane components, which translates into higher sphingolipid content in the lipidome of killer whales, potentially as a structural adaptation for their higher hydrodynamic performance. Finally, the presence of both lipid-enriched and lipid-depleted individuals within the killer whale population in Norway suggests dietary specialization, consistent with significant differences in \u03b415N and \u03b413C isotopic ratios in skin between the two groups, with higher values and a wider niche for the lipid-enriched individuals.

  "description": "Cooperative Self-Assembly in Linear ChainsBased on Halogen Bonds\u00a9 2021 The Authors. ChemPlusChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbHCooperative properties of halogen bonds were investigated with computational experiments based on dispersion-corrected relativistic density functional theory. The bonding mechanism in linear chains of cyanogen halide (X\u2212CN), halocyanoacetylene (X\u2212CC\u2212CN), and 4-halobenzonitrile (X\u2212C6H4\u2212CN) were examined for X = H, Cl, Br, and I. Our energy decomposition and Kohn-Sham molecular-orbital analyses revealed the bonding mechanism of the studied systems. Cyanogen halide and halocyanoacetylene chains possess an extra stabilizing effect with increasing chain size, whereas the 4-halobenzonitrile chains do not. This cooperativity can be traced back to charge separation within the \u03c3-electronic system by charge-transfer between the lone-pair orbital of the nitrogen (\u03c3HOMO) on one unit and the acceptor orbital of the C\u2212X (\u03c3*LUMO) on the adjacent unit. As such, the HOMO-LUMO gap in the \u03c3-system decreases, and the cooperativity increases with chain length revealing the similarity in the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen and halogen bonds."

  "title": "D-dopachrome tautomerase contributes to lung epithelial repair via atypical chemokine receptor 3-dependent Akt signaling\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)Background: Emphysematous COPD is characterized by aberrant alveolar repair. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) contributes to alveolar repair, but for its structural and functional homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) this is unknown. MIF mediates its effects through CD74 and/or C-X-C chemokine receptors 2 (CXCR2), 4(CXCR4), and possibly 7 (ACKR3). DDT can also signal through CD74, but interactions with other receptors have not been described yet. We therefore aimed at investigating if and how DDT contributes to epithelial repair in COPD. Methods: We studied effects of recombinant DDT on cell proliferation and survival by clonogenic assay and annexin V-PI staining respectively. DDT-induced signaling was investigated by Western blot. Effects on epithelial growth and differentiation was studied using lung organoid cultures with primary murine or human epithelial cells and incubating with DDT or an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. DDT-ACKR3 interactions were identified by ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation. Findings: We found that DDT promoted proliferation of and prevented staurosporine-induced apoptosis in A549 lung epithelial cells. Importantly, DDT also stimulated growth of primary alveolar epithelial cells as DDT treatment resulted in significantly more and larger murine and human alveolar organoids compared to untreated controls. The anti-apoptotic effect of DDT and DDT-induced organoid growth were inhibited in the presence of an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. Furthermore, ELISA assay and co-immunoprecipitation suggested DDT complexes with ACKR3. DDT could activate the PI3K-Akt pathway and this activation was enhanced in ACKR3-overexpressing cells. Interpretation: In conclusion, DDT contributes to alveolar epithelial repair via ACKR3 and may thus augment lung epithelial repair in COPD.General information",

  "description": "Reduced mGluR5 Activity Modulates Mitochondrial FunctionThe metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is an essential modulator of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory; whereas in pathological conditions, it is an acknowledged therapeutic target that has been implicated in multiple brain disorders. Despite robust pre-clinical data, mGluR5 antagonists failed in several clinical trials, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying mGluR5 function. In this study, we dissected the molecular synaptic modulation mediated by mGluR5 using genetic and pharmacological mouse models to chronically and acutely reduce mGluR5 activity. We found that next to dysregulation of synaptic proteins, the major regulation in protein expression in both models concerned specific processes in mitochondria, such as oxidative phosphorylation. Second, we observed morphological alterations in shape and area of specifically postsynaptic mitochondria in mGluR5 KO synapses using electron microscopy. Third, computational and biochemical assays suggested an increase of mitochondrial function in neurons, with increased level of NADP/H and oxidative damage in mGluR5 KO. Altogether, our observations provide diverse lines of evidence of the modulation of synaptic mitochondrial function by mGluR5. This connection suggests a role for mGluR5 as a mediator between synaptic activity and mitochondrial function, a finding which might be relevant for the improvement of the clinical potential of mGluR5."

  "description": "New approach methods supporting read-across: Two neurotoxicity AOP-based IATA case studiesRead-across approaches are considered key in moving away from in vivo animal testing towards addressing data-gaps using new approach methods (NAMs). Ample successful examples are still required to substantiate this strategy. Here we present and discuss the learnings from two OECD IATA endorsed read-across case studies. They involve two classes of pesticides -rotenoids and strobilurins- each having a defined mode-of-action that is assessed for its neurological hazard by means of an AOP-based testing strategy coupled to toxicokinetic simulations of human tissue concentrations. The endpoint in question is potential mitochondrial respiratory chain mediated neurotoxicity, specifically through inhibition of complex I or III. An AOP linking inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons formed the basis for both cases, but was deployed in two different regulatory contexts. The two cases also exemplify several different read-across concepts: analogue versus category approach, consolidated versus putative AOP, positive versus negative prediction (i.e., neurotoxicity versus low potential for neurotoxicity), and structural versus biological similarity. We applied a range of NAMs to explore the toxicodynamic properties of the compounds, e.g., in silico docking as well as in vitro assays and readouts -including transcriptomics- in various cell systems, all anchored to the relevant AOPs. Interestingly, although some of the data addressing certain elements of the read-across were associated with high uncertainty, their impact on the overall read-across conclusion remained limited. Coupled to the elaborate regulatory review that the two cases underwent, we propose some generic learnings of AOP-based testing strategies supporting read-across."

  "description": "Association of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants and children's behavior at a median age of 18 monthsExposure to polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants (FRs) could have adverse effects on neurodevelopment in children. Some organophosphate (OPFRs) are used as alternatives for the phased-out decabromodiphenylether such as resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate (PBDPP) and bisphenol A bis(diphenyl phosphate (BPA-BDPP). This study aims to investigate the relationship between indoor OPFR exposure and neurodevelopmental behavior in children. OPFRs were measured in house dust and hand wipes from 42 children, aged 8-16 months, from the LInking maternal Nutrition to Child health (LINC) study. At the median age of 18 months, the children's behavior was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist, using three composite behavior scales: externalizing problems, internalizing problems, and total problems. Linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for maternal education and smoking by the partner. Children with higher BPA-BDPP, PBDPP, and tris(chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) house dust concentrations were found to have higher scores on the behavioral problems scales. A 10-fold increase in BPA-BDPP and PBDPP concentration was associated with a 4.1 and 2.6 point increase on the internalizing problems scale (respectively p=0.004 and p=0.042). Increased BPA-BDPP concentrations were associated with elevated scores on the externalizing problems scale and total behavioral problems scale (respectively 7.6 and 16 points increase per 10-fold BPA-BDPP concentration increase, p=0.015 and p=0.007). TCEP dust concentrations were associated with the externalizing problems scale (13 point increase per 10-fold TCEP concentration increase, p=0.043). This study showed the importance of investigating the health effects of exposure to organophosphate flame retardants. Further research on neurodevelopmental health effects of OPFR exposure is warranted."

Subsequent regio- and diastereoselective, inter- and intramolecular dipolar cycloaddition reactions with variously substituted electron-deficient alkenes enabled ready and efficient access to structurally complex pyrrolidine architectures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the dipolar cycloaddition reactions uncovered an intimate balance between asynchronicity and interaction energies of transition structures, which ultimately control the unusual selectivities observed in certain cases."

  "description": "Age-Dependent Hippocampal Proteomics in the APP/PS1 Alzheimer Mouse Model: A Comparative Analysis with Classical SWATH/DIA and directDIA ApproachesAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the human population, for which there is currently no cure. The cause of AD is unknown; however, the toxic effects of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) are believed to play a role in its onset. To investigate this, we examined changes in global protein levels in a hippocampal synaptosome fraction of the Amyloid Precursor Protein swe/Presenelin 1 dE9 (APP/PS1) mouse model of AD at 6 and 12 months of age (moa). Data independent acquisition (DIA), or Sequential Window Acquisition of all THeoretical fragment-ion (SWATH), was used for a quantitative label-free proteomics analysis. We first assessed the usefulness of a recently improved directDIA workflow as an alternative to conventional DIA data analysis using a project-specific spectral library. Subsequently, we applied directDIA to the 6- and 12-moa APP/PS1 datasets and applied the Mass Spectrometry Downstream Analysis Pipeline (MS-DAP) for differential expression analysis and candidate discovery. We observed most regulation at 12-moa, in particular of proteins involved in A\u03b2 homeostasis and microglial-dependent processes, like synaptic pruning and the immune response, such as APOE, CLU and C1QA-C. All proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD025777."

Quantifying hydrophobicity of the human proteome Proteins tend to bury hydrophobic residues inside their core during the folding process to provide stability to the protein structure and to prevent aggregation. Nevertheless, proteins do expose some 'sticky' hydrophobic residues to the solvent. These residues can play an important functional role, for example in protein-protein and membrane interactions. Here, we investigate how hydrophobic protein surfaces are by providing three measures for surface hydrophobicity: the total hydrophobic surface area, the relative hydrophobic surface area, and - using our MolPatch method - the largest hydrophobic patch. Secondly, we analyse how difficult it is to predict these measures from sequence: by adapting solvent accessibility predictions from NetSurfP2.0, we obtain well-performing prediction methods for the THSA and RHSA, while predicting LHP is more difficult. Finally, we analyse implications of exposed hydrophobic surfaces: we show that hydrophobic proteins typically have low expression, suggesting cells avoid an overabundance of sticky proteins. "

In this study, a split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid assay was used to identify H4R interactors in a Jurkat T cell line cDNA library. Forty-three novel H4R interactors were identified, of which 17 have also been previously observed in MYTH screens to interact with other GPCR subtypes. The interaction of H4R with the tetraspanin TSPAN4 was confirmed in transfected cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, bimolecular fluorescence complementation, and co-immunoprecipitation. Histamine stimulation reduced the interaction between H4R and TSPAN4, but TSPAN4 did not affect H4R-mediated G protein signaling. Nonetheless, the identification of novel GPCR interactors by MYTH is a starting point to further investigate the regulation of GPCR signaling."

  "description": "On-top description of the effect of excitation on electron correlation with quasiparticles\u00a92021 American Physical SocietyA spectrum of -correlon quasiparticles is proposed to describe the excitation effect on electron correlation. The proposed quasiparticle description is based on the comparison of the pair-correlation functions of the excited and ground states at the special coalescence points of the configurational space. The complex form of the -correlon wave function allows us to naturally separate regions with the excitation suppression of correlation (ESC -correlon), where correlation is stronger in the ground state, from those with the excitation enhancement of correlation (EEC -correlon), where correlation is stronger in the excited state. The proposed -correlon approach is applied to characterize the important single excitations with the competition of \u201canticorrelation squeezing\u201d and \u201cenhanced-correlation spreading\u201d of the two-electron distribution. The former feature characterizes single valence excitations of the ionic nature and this leads to the prevailing of the ESC effect in this type of excitations. In turn, the enhanced-correlation spreading characterizes single Rydberg excitations, which leads to the prevailing of the EEC effect in this type of excitations. The proposed -correlon quasiparticles are studied both analytically and numerically. The analytical expressions for the on-top correlation functions are obtained with the two-determinantal two-electron model of the active site of an excitation. The two-dimensional contour plots of the ESC and EEC -correlons obtained for the lowest vertical valence ionic and Rydberg excitations in the prototype molecules , and from the highly correlated wave functions confirm, in general, the trends in the relative correlation strength deduced from the model."

Het stichten, inrichten en bouwen van organisaties waarin wordt gestreefd naar een her-balans die ten goede komt aan people en planet, zonder profit te veronachtzamen, staat centraal in dit boek. Vanuit een integrale visie op circulaire innovatie en duurzame vernieuwing gaat het boek in op alle belangrijke aspecten, methodes en concepten die kunnen worden ingezet om op duurzame en maatschappelijk verantwoorde wij ze te ondernemen, te innoveren, te produceren en te organiseren."

  "description": "Fluorescent tagging of endogenous Heme oxygenase-1 in human induced pluripotent stem cells for high content imaging of oxidative stress in various differentiated lineagesTagging of endogenous stress response genes can provide valuable in vitro models for chemical safety assessment. Here, we present the generation and application of a fluorescent human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) reporter line for Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1), which is considered a sensitive and reliable biomarker for the oxidative stress response. CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to insert an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) at the C-terminal end of the endogenous HMOX1 gene. Individual clones were selected and extensively characterized to confirm precise editing and retained stem cell properties. Bardoxolone-methyl (CDDO-Me) induced oxidative stress caused similarly increased expression of both the wild-type and eGFP-tagged HMOX1 at the mRNA and protein level. Fluorescently tagged hiPSC-derived proximal tubule-like, hepatocyte-like, cardiomyocyte-like and neuron-like progenies were treated with CDDO-Me (5.62-1000 nM) or diethyl maleate (5.62-1000 \u00b5M) for 24 h and 72 h. Multi-lineage oxidative stress responses were assessed through transcriptomics analysis, and HMOX1-eGFP reporter expression was carefully monitored using live-cell confocal imaging. We found that eGFP intensity increased in a dose-dependent manner with dynamics varying amongst lineages and stressors. Point of departure modelling further captured the specific lineage sensitivities towards oxidative stress. We anticipate that the newly developed HMOX1 hiPSC reporter will become a valuable tool in understanding and quantifying critical target organ cell-specific oxidative stress responses induced by (newly developed) chemical entities."
