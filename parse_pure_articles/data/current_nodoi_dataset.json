  "description": "Front Cover: \u03c3\u2010Electrons Responsible for Cooperativity and Ring Equalization in Hydrogen\u2010Bonded Supramolecular PolymersThe cover picture shows \u03c3-electrons, which by traveling through the chain, strengthen the hydrogen bonds in squaramide linear chains. This increasing gain in stability becomes more pronounced when the chain elongates and originates from the donor\u2013acceptor charge transfer interaction within the \u03c3-electronic system. As the charge flows from one end of the chain towards the other, it amplifies the charge separation across the chain, resulting in a stronger hydrogen bond with the new incoming monomer.

  "description": "(Astro)Chemistry: From Molecules to ReactionsOne of the biggest challenges in astrochemistry is to gain a better understanding of the chemical processes that take place in space. This could ultimately help to answer the question: What is the origin of life on Earth? This thesis has aimed to get an idea of the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in space. This has been done by envisioning that that gaining a better understanding of related earthlike processes will help to obtain a more complete picture of analogous processes within an astrochemical context. An example of a chemical reaction that is commonly used in laboratories to create six-membered ring motifs is the Diels-Alder reaction. This thesis is, therefore, dedicated to obtaining a better understanding of how different types of Lewis acids catalyze Diels-Alder reactions by using state-of-the-art quantum chemical techniques. The results obtained in this thesis completely contradict the traditional view of Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder reactions and thus present a paradigm shift in organic chemistry. In fact, it turns out that Lewis acid catalysts accelerate Diels-Alder reaction not by increasing the attraction between the reactants but rather by reducing the steric repulsion between them. These, and other finding emerging from this thesis, not only provide a more complete understanding of the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in space but also contribute to the development of more economically and environmentally sustainable Lewis acid-catalyzed Diels-Alder reactions."

Thus, the development of human-based models for toxicity testing is highly encouraged. Here, we propose an in vitro multi-organ strategy to assess the toxicity of chemicals. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived models of the brain, blood-brain barrier, kidney, liver and vasculature were generated and exposed to paraquat (PQ), a widely employed herbicide with known toxic effects in kidneys and brain. The models showed differential cytotoxic sensitivity to PQ after acute exposure. TempO-Seq\u2122 analysis with a set of 3565 probes revealed the deregulation of oxidative stress, unfolded protein response and Estrogen Receptor-mediated signaling pathways, in line with the existing knowledge on PQ mechanisms of action. The main advantages of this strategy are to assess chemical toxicity on multiple tissues/organs in parallel, exclusively in human cells, eliminating the interspecies bias, allowing a better evaluation of the differential sensitivity of the models representing the diverse organs, and increasing the chance to identify toxic compounds. Furthermore, although we focused on the mechanisms of action of PQ shared by the different models, this strategy would also allow for organ-specific toxicity testing, by including more cell type-specific probes for TempO-Seq analyses. In conclusion, we believe this strategy will participate in the further improvement of chemical risk assessment for human health."

  "description": "Implementation of Zebrafish Ontologies for Toxicology ScreeningToxicological evaluation of chemicals using early-life stage zebrafish (Danio rerio) involves the observation and recording of altered phenotypes. Substantial variability has been observed among researchers in phenotypes reported from similar studies, as well as a lack of consistent data annotation, indicating a need for both terminological and data harmonization. When examined from a data science perspective, many of these apparent differences can be parsed into the same or similar endpoints whose measurements differ only in time, methodology, or nomenclature. Ontological knowledge structures can be leveraged to integrate diverse data sets across terminologies, scales, and modalities. Building on this premise, the National Toxicology Program\u2019s Systematic Evaluation of the Application of Zebrafish in Toxicology undertook a collaborative exercise to evaluate how the application of standardized phenotype terminology improved data consistency. To accomplish this, zebrafish researchers were asked to assess images of zebrafish larvae for morphological malformations in two surveys. In the first survey, researchers were asked to annotate observed malformations using their own terminology. In the second survey, researchers were asked to annotate the images from a list of terms and definitions from the Zebrafish Phenotype Ontology. Analysis of the results suggested that the use of ontology terms increased consistency and decreased ambiguity, but a larger study is needed to confirm. We conclude that utilizing a common data standard will not only reduce the heterogeneity of reported terms but increases agreement and repeatability between different laboratories. Thus, we advocate for the development of a zebrafish phenotype atlas to help laboratories create interoperable, computable data."

A validated target for the treatment of HAT is the parasitic T.b. cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase B1 (TbrPDEB1). Although nanomolar TbrPDEB1 inhibitors have been obtained, their activity against the off-target human PDE4 (hPDE4) is likely to lead to undesirable clinical side effects, such as nausea, emesis, and immune suppression. Thus, new and more selective TbrPDEB1 inhibitors are still needed. This retrospective study evaluated the free energy perturbation (FEP+) method to predict the affinity profiles of TbrPDEB1 inhibitors against hPDE4. We demonstrate that FEP+ can be used to accurately predict the activity profiles of these homologous proteins. Moreover, we show how FEP+ can overcome challenges like protein flexibility and high sequence conservation. This also implies that the method can be applied prospectively for the lead optimization campaigns to design new and more selective TbrPDEB1 inhibitors."

This study looked to extend the use of WBE to explore the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that have been used in response to COVID-19 and compare the results to the effect of such interventions on COVID-19 hospitalizations. A data-driven approach demonstrated that trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, from Amsterdam and Utrecht (The Netherlands), precede hospitalizations by at least 3\u20139 days. Additionally, the effect of NPIs can be seen in wastewater and hospitalizations after 20 and 24 days, respectively. Changepoint analysis indicated that the closure of schools and universities significantly reduced the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and COVID-19 hospitalizations. Regression modeling suggested the stay-at-home policy is an effective intervention for reducing the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater, whereas the closure of workplaces significantly reduced hospitalizations in both Dutch cities. This study demonstrates how WBE can be used to inform public health decisions and anticipate future strain on healthcare facilities in major cities but also indicates a need for higher temporal resolution of wastewater sampling."

  "description": "Tumour break load is a biologically relevant feature of genomic instability with prognostic value in colorectal cancerBACKGROUND: Clinically implemented prognostic biomarkers are lacking for the 80% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) that exhibit chromosomal instability (CIN). CIN is characterised by chromosome segregation errors and double-strand break repair defects that lead to somatic copy number aberrations (SCNAs) and chromosomal rearrangement-associated structural variants (SVs), respectively. We hypothesise that the number of SVs is a distinct feature of genomic instability and defined a new measure to quantify SVs: the tumour break load (TBL). The present study aimed to characterise the biological impact and clinical relevance of TBL in CRC.METHODS: Disease-free survival and SCNA data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and two independent CRC studies. TBL was defined as the sum of SCNA-associated SVs. RNA gene expression data of microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC samples were used to train an RNA-based TBL classifier. Dichotomised DNA-based TBL data were used for survival analysis.RESULTS: TBL shows large variation in CRC with poor correlation to tumour mutational burden and fraction of genome altered. TBL impact on tumour biology was illustrated by the high accuracy of classifying cancers in TBL-high and TBL-low (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.88; p < 0.01). High TBL was associated with disease recurrence in 85 stages II-III MSS CRCs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.1; p = 0.007) and in two independent validation series of 57 untreated stages II-III (HR: 4.1; p = 0.012) and 74 untreated stage II MSS CRCs (HR: 2.4; p = 0.01).CONCLUSION: TBL is a prognostic biomarker in patients with non-metastatic MSS CRC with great potential to be implemented in routine molecular diagnostics."

  "description": "Towards a knowledge graph for pre-/probiotics and microbiota-gut-brain axis diseasesScientific publications present biological relationships but are structured for human reading, making it difficult to use this resource for semantic integration and querying. Existing databases, on the other hand, are well structured for automated analysis, but do not contain comprehensive biological knowledge. We devised an approach for constructing comprehensive knowledge graphs from these two types of resources and applied it to investigate relationships between pre-/probiotics and microbiota-gut-brain axis diseases. To this end, we created (i) a knowledge base, dubbed ppstatement, containing manually curated detailed annotations, and (ii) a knowledge base, called ppconcept, containing automatically annotated concepts. The resulting Pre-/Probiotics Knowledge Graph (PPKG) combines these two knowledge bases with three other public databases (i.e. MeSH, UMLS and SNOMED CT). To validate the performance of PPKG and to demonstrate the added value of integrating two knowledge bases, we created four biological query cases. The query cases demonstrate that we can retrieve co-occurring concepts of interest, and also that combining the two knowledge bases leads to more comprehensive query results than utilizing them separately. The PPKG enables users to pose research queries such as \"which pre-/probiotics combinations may benefit depression?\", potentially leading to novel biological insights."

  "description": "Bioinformatics tools and data resources for assay development of fluid protein biomarkersFluid protein biomarkers are important tools in clinical research and health care to support diagnosis and to monitor patients. Especially within the field of dementia, novel biomarkers could address the current challenges of providing an early diagnosis and of selecting trial participants. While the great potential of fluid biomarkers is recognized, their implementation in routine clinical use has been slow. One major obstacle is the often unsuccessful translation of biomarker candidates from explorative high-throughput techniques to sensitive antibody-based immunoassays. In this review, we propose the incorporation of bioinformatics into the workflow of novel immunoassay development to overcome this bottleneck and thus facilitate the development of novel biomarkers towards clinical laboratory practice. Due to the rapid progress within the field of bioinformatics many freely available and easy-to-use tools and data resources exist which can aid the researcher at various stages. Current prediction methods and databases can support the selection of suitable biomarker candidates, as well as the choice of appropriate commercial affinity reagents. Additionally, we examine methods that can determine or predict the epitope - an antibody's binding region on its antigen - and can help to make an informed choice on the immunogenic peptide used for novel antibody production. Selected use cases for biomarker candidates help illustrate the application and interpretation of the introduced tools."

  "description": "INFLECT: an R-package for cytometry cluster evaluation using marker modalityBACKGROUND: Current methods of high-dimensional unsupervised clustering of mass cytometry data lack means to monitor and evaluate clustering results. Whether unsupervised clustering is correct is typically evaluated by agreement with dimensionality reduction techniques or based on benchmarking with manually classified cells. The ambiguity and lack of reproducibility of sequential gating has been replaced with ambiguity in interpretation of clustering results. On the other hand, spurious overclustering of data leads to loss of statistical power. We have developed INFLECT, an R-package designed to give insight in clustering results and provide an optimal number of clusters. In our approach, a mass cytometry dataset is overclustered intentionally to ensure the smallest phenotypically different subsets are captured using FlowSOM. A range of metacluster number endpoints are generated and evaluated using marker interquartile range and distribution unimodality checks. The fraction of marker distributions that pass these checks is taken as a measure of clustering success. The fraction of unimodal distributions within metaclusters is plotted against the number of generated metaclusters and reaches a plateau of diminishing returns. The inflection point at which this occurs gives an optimal point of capturing cellular heterogeneity versus statistical power.RESULTS: We applied INFLECT to four publically available mass cytometry datasets of different size and number of markers. The unimodality score consistently reached a plateau, with an inflection point dependent on dataset size and number of dimensions. We tested both ConsenusClusterPlus metaclustering and hierarchical clustering. While hierarchical clustering is less computationally expensive and thus faster, it achieved similar results to ConsensusClusterPlus. The four datasets consisted of labeled data and we compared INFLECT metaclustering to published results. INFLECT identified a higher optimal number of metaclusters for all datasets. We illustrated the underlying heterogeneity within labels, showing that these labels encompass distinct types of cells.CONCLUSION: INFLECT addresses a knowledge gap in high-dimensional cytometry analysis, namely assessing clustering results. This is done through monitoring marker distributions for interquartile range and unimodality across a range of metacluster numbers. The inflection point is the optimal trade-off between cellular heterogeneity and statistical power, applied in this work for FlowSOM clustering on mass cytometry datasets."
