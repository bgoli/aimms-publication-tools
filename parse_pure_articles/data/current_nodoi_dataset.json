  "description": "Protein cost allocation explains metabolic strategies in Escherichia coliIn-depth understanding of microbial growth is crucial for the development of new advances in biotechnology and for combating microbial pathogens. Condition-specific proteome expression is central to microbial physiology and growth. A multitude of processes are dependent on the protein expression, thus, whole-cell analysis of microbial metabolism using genome-scale metabolic models is an attractive toolset to investigate the behaviour of microorganisms and their communities. However, genome-scale models that incorporate macromolecular expression are still inhibitory complex: the conceptual and computational complexity of these models severely limits their potential applications. In the need for alternatives, here we revisit some of the previous attempts to create genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression to develop a novel framework for integrating protein abundance and turnover costs to conventional genome-scale models. We show that such a model of Escherichia coli successfully reproduces experimentally determined adaptations of metabolism in a growth condition-dependent manner. Moreover, the model can be used as means of investigating underutilization of the protein machinery among different growth settings. Notably, we obtained strongly improved predictions of flux distributions, considering the costs of protein translation explicitly. This finding in turn suggests protein translation being the main regulation hub for cellular growth."

  "description": "Network medicine framework shows that proximity of polyphenol targets and disease proteins predicts therapeutic effects of polyphenolsPolyphenols, natural products present in plant-based foods, play a protective role against several complex diseases through their antioxidant activity and by diverse molecular mechanisms. Here we develop a network medicine framework to uncover mechanisms for the effects of polyphenols on health by considering the molecular interactions between polyphenol protein targets and proteins associated with diseases. We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighbourhoods of the human interactome, whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the molecule\u2019s known therapeutic effects. The methodology recovers known associations, such as the effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on type 2 diabetes, and predicts that rosmarinic acid has a direct impact on platelet function, representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health. We experimentally confirm that rosmarinic acid inhibits platelet aggregation and \u03b1-granule secretion through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, offering direct support for the predicted molecular mechanism. Our framework represents a starting point for mechanistic interpretation of the health effects underlying food-related compounds, allowing us to integrate into a predictive framework knowledge on food metabolism, bioavailability and drug interaction. Molecular interactions between polyphenol targets and proteins associated with disease are explored through a network medicine framework. The network proximity of polyphenol protein targets to disease proteins can predict therapeutic effects, highlighting more broadly the potential of network medicine as a tool for nutritional sciences."

It became clear that the inclusion of information to enhance discussions among this mix of participants would be even more valuable. The present version retains a chemical structure theme while expanding tutorial comments that aim to bridge the various perspectives that may arise during interdisciplinary communications about a given term.

ChemPlusChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbHCooperative properties of halogen bonds were investigated with computational experiments based on dispersion-corrected relativistic density functional theory. The bonding mechanism in linear chains of cyanogen halide (X\u2212CN), halocyanoacetylene (X\u2212CC\u2212CN), and 4-halobenzonitrile (X\u2212C6H4\u2212CN) were examined for X = H, Cl, Br, and I. Our energy decomposition and Kohn-Sham molecular-orbital analyses revealed the bonding mechanism of the studied systems. Cyanogen halide and halocyanoacetylene chains possess an extra stabilizing effect with increasing chain size, whereas the 4-halobenzonitrile chains do not. This cooperativity can be traced back to charge separation within the \u03c3-electronic system by charge-transfer between the lone-pair orbital of the nitrogen (\u03c3HOMO) on one unit and the acceptor orbital of the C\u2212X (\u03c3*LUMO) on the adjacent unit. As such, the HOMO-LUMO gap in the \u03c3-system decreases, and the cooperativity increases with chain length revealing the similarity in the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen and halogen bonds."

  "description": "Structure and dynamics of a mycobacterial typeVII secretion systemMycobacterium tuberculosis is the cause of one of the most important infectious diseases in humans, which leads to 1.4 million deaths every year1. Specialized protein transport systems-known as type VII secretion systems (T7SSs)-are central to the virulence of this pathogen, and are also crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport across the mycobacterial cell envelope2,3. Here we present the structure of an intact T7SS inner-membrane complex of M. tuberculosis. We show how the 2.32-MDa ESX-5 assembly, which contains 165 transmembrane helices, is restructured and stabilized as a trimer of dimers by the MycP5 protease. A trimer of MycP5 caps a central periplasmic dome-like chamber that is formed by three EccB5 dimers, with the proteolytic sites of MycP5 facing towards the cavity. This chamber suggests a central secretion and processing conduit. Complexes without MycP5 show disruption of the EccB5 periplasmic assembly and increased flexibility, which highlights the importance of MycP5 for complex integrity. Beneath the EccB5-MycP5 chamber, dimers of the EccC5 ATPase assemble into three bundles of four transmembrane helices each, which together seal the potential central secretion channel. Individual cytoplasmic EccC5 domains adopt two distinctive conformations that probably reflect different secretion states. Our work suggests a previously undescribed mechanism of protein transport and provides a structural scaffold to aid in the development of drugs against this major human pathogen."

Our current understanding about lipid stores and uses in cetaceans is still limited, and most studies only focused on a single narrow snapshot of the lipidome. We documented an extended lipidomic fingerprint in two cetacean species present in northern Norway during wintertime. We were able to detect 817 molecular lipid species in blubber of killer whales (Orcinus orca) and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). The profiles were largely dominated by triradylglycerols in both species and, to a lesser extent, by other constituents including glycerophosphocholines, phosphosphingolipids, glycerophosphoethanolamines, and diradylglycerols. Through a unique combination of traditional statistical approaches, together with a novel bioinformatic tool (LION/web), we showed contrasting fingerprint composition between species. The higher content of triradylglycerols in humpback whales is necessary to fuel their upcoming half a year fasting and energy-demanding migration between feeding and breeding grounds. In adipocytes, we assume that the intense feeding rate of humpback whales prior to migration translates into an important accumulation of triacylglycerol content in lipid droplets. Upstream, the endoplasmic reticulum is operating at full capacity to supply acute lipid storage, consistent with the reported enrichment of glycerophosphocholines in humpback whales, major components of the endoplasmic reticulum. There was also an enrichment of membrane components, which translates into higher sphingolipid content in the lipidome of killer whales, potentially as a structural adaptation for their higher hydrodynamic performance. Finally, the presence of both lipid-enriched and lipid-depleted individuals within the killer whale population in Norway suggests dietary specialization, consistent with significant differences in \u03b415N and \u03b413C isotopic ratios in skin between the two groups, with higher values and a wider niche for the lipid-enriched individuals.

  "title": "D-dopachrome tautomerase contributes to lung epithelial repair via atypical chemokine receptor 3-dependent Akt signaling\u00a9 2021 The Author(s)Background: Emphysematous COPD is characterized by aberrant alveolar repair. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) contributes to alveolar repair, but for its structural and functional homolog D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) this is unknown. MIF mediates its effects through CD74 and/or C-X-C chemokine receptors 2 (CXCR2), 4(CXCR4), and possibly 7 (ACKR3). DDT can also signal through CD74, but interactions with other receptors have not been described yet. We therefore aimed at investigating if and how DDT contributes to epithelial repair in COPD. Methods: We studied effects of recombinant DDT on cell proliferation and survival by clonogenic assay and annexin V-PI staining respectively. DDT-induced signaling was investigated by Western blot. Effects on epithelial growth and differentiation was studied using lung organoid cultures with primary murine or human epithelial cells and incubating with DDT or an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. DDT-ACKR3 interactions were identified by ELISA and co-immunoprecipitation. Findings: We found that DDT promoted proliferation of and prevented staurosporine-induced apoptosis in A549 lung epithelial cells. Importantly, DDT also stimulated growth of primary alveolar epithelial cells as DDT treatment resulted in significantly more and larger murine and human alveolar organoids compared to untreated controls. The anti-apoptotic effect of DDT and DDT-induced organoid growth were inhibited in the presence of an ACKR3-blocking nanobody. Furthermore, ELISA assay and co-immunoprecipitation suggested DDT complexes with ACKR3. DDT could activate the PI3K-Akt pathway and this activation was enhanced in ACKR3-overexpressing cells. Interpretation: In conclusion, DDT contributes to alveolar epithelial repair via ACKR3 and may thus augment lung epithelial repair in COPD.General information",

  "title": "Probing Polyester Branching by Hybrid Trapped Ion-Mobility Spectrometry-Tandem Mass Spectrometry\u00a9 Trapped ion-mobility spectrometry combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-QTOFMS) was evaluated as a tool for resolving linear and branched isomeric polyester oligomers. Solutions of polyester samples were infused directly into the ion source employing electrospray ionization (ESI). TIMS-MS provides both mobility and m/z data on the formed ions, allowing construction of extracted-ion mobilograms (EIMs). EIMs of polyester molecules showed multimodal patterns, indicating conformational differences among isomers. Subsequent TIMS-MS/MS experiments indicated mobility differences to be caused by (degree of) branching. These assignments were supported by liquid chromatography-TIMS-MS/MS analysis, confirming that direct TIMS-MS provided fast (500 ms/scan) distinction between linear and branched small oligomers. Observing larger oligomers (up to 3000 Da) using TIMS required additional molecular charging to ensure ion entrapment within the mobility window. Molecular supercharging was achieved using m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA). The additional charges on the oligomer structures enhanced mobility separation of isomeric species but also added to the complexity of the obtained fragmentation mass spectra. This complexity could be partly reduced by post-TIMS analyte-decharging applying collision-induced dissociation (CID) prior to Q1 with subsequent isolation of the singly charged ions for further fragmentation. The as-obtained EIM profiles were still quite complex as larger molecules possess more possible structural isomers.

  "description": "Probing Polyester Branching by Hybrid Trapped Ion-Mobility Spectrometry-Tandem Mass Spectrometry\u00a9 Trapped ion-mobility spectrometry combined with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TIMS-QTOFMS) was evaluated as a tool for resolving linear and branched isomeric polyester oligomers. Solutions of polyester samples were infused directly into the ion source employing electrospray ionization (ESI). TIMS-MS provides both mobility and m/z data on the formed ions, allowing construction of extracted-ion mobilograms (EIMs). EIMs of polyester molecules showed multimodal patterns, indicating conformational differences among isomers. Subsequent TIMS-MS/MS experiments indicated mobility differences to be caused by (degree of) branching. These assignments were supported by liquid chromatography-TIMS-MS/MS analysis, confirming that direct TIMS-MS provided fast (500 ms/scan) distinction between linear and branched small oligomers. Observing larger oligomers (up to 3000 Da) using TIMS required additional molecular charging to ensure ion entrapment within the mobility window. Molecular supercharging was achieved using m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (NBA). The additional charges on the oligomer structures enhanced mobility separation of isomeric species but also added to the complexity of the obtained fragmentation mass spectra. This complexity could be partly reduced by post-TIMS analyte-decharging applying collision-induced dissociation (CID) prior to Q1 with subsequent isolation of the singly charged ions for further fragmentation. The as-obtained EIM profiles were still quite complex as larger molecules possess more possible structural isomers. Nevertheless, distinguishing between linear and symmetrically branched oligomers was possible based on measured differences in collisional cross sections (CCSs). The established TIMS-QTOFMS approach reliably allows branching information on isomeric polyester molecules up to 3000 Da to be obtained in less than 1 min analysis time."

  "description": "Contribution of genetic ancestry and polygenic risk score in meeting vitamin B12 needs in healthy Brazilian children and adolescentsPolymorphisms in genes related to the metabolism of vitamin B12 haven't been examined in a Brazilian population. To (a) determine the correlation between the local genetic ancestry components and vitamin B12 levels using ninety B12-related genes; (b) determine associations between these genes and their SNPs with vitamin B12 levels; (c) determine a polygenic risk score (PRS) using significant variants. This cross-sectional study included 168 children and adolescents, aged 9-13 years old. Total cobalamin was measured in plasma. Genotyping arrays and whole exome data were combined to yield\u2009~\u20097000 SNPs in 90 genes related to vitamin B12. The Efficient Local Ancestry Inference was used to estimate local ancestry for African (AFR), Native American, and European (EUR). The association between the genotypes and vitamin B12 levels were determined with generalized estimating equation. Vitamin B12 levels were driven by positive (EUR) and negative (AFR, AMR) correlations with genetic ancestry. A set of 36 variants were used to create a PRS that explained 42% of vitamin level variation. Vitamin B12 levels are influenced by genetic ancestry and a PRS explained almost 50% of the variation in plasma cobalamin in Brazilian children and adolescents."

  "description": "New approach methods supporting read-across: Two neurotoxicity AOP-based IATA case studiesRead-across approaches are considered key in moving away from in vivo animal testing towards addressing data-gaps using new approach methods (NAMs). Ample successful examples are still required to substantiate this strategy. Here we present and discuss the learnings from two OECD IATA endorsed read-across case studies. They involve two classes of pesticides -rotenoids and strobilurins- each having a defined mode-of-action that is assessed for its neurological hazard by means of an AOP-based testing strategy coupled to toxicokinetic simulations of human tissue concentrations. The endpoint in question is potential mitochondrial respiratory chain mediated neurotoxicity, specifically through inhibition of complex I or III. An AOP linking inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons formed the basis for both cases, but was deployed in two different regulatory contexts. The two cases also exemplify several different read-across concepts: analogue versus category approach, consolidated versus putative AOP, positive versus negative prediction (i.e., neurotoxicity versus low potential for neurotoxicity), and structural versus biological similarity. We applied a range of NAMs to explore the toxicodynamic properties of the compounds, e.g., in silico docking as well as in vitro assays and readouts -including transcriptomics- in various cell systems, all anchored to the relevant AOPs. Interestingly, although some of the data addressing certain elements of the read-across were associated with high uncertainty, their impact on the overall read-across conclusion remained limited. Coupled to the elaborate regulatory review that the two cases underwent, we propose some generic learnings of AOP-based testing strategies supporting read-across."

Subsequent regio- and diastereoselective, inter- and intramolecular dipolar cycloaddition reactions with variously substituted electron-deficient alkenes enabled ready and efficient access to structurally complex pyrrolidine architectures. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the dipolar cycloaddition reactions uncovered an intimate balance between asynchronicity and interaction energies of transition structures, which ultimately control the unusual selectivities observed in certain cases."

The aim of this study was to explore differences in proteomic profiles, for 117 pro-inflammatory proteins, in two previously defined groups of individuals with different DNA damage and EPA and DHA levels. Healthy children and adolescents (n = 140) aged 9 to 13 years old in an urban area of Brazil were divided by k-means cluster test into two clusters of DNA damage (tail intensity) using the comet assay (cluster 1 = 5.9% \u00b1 1.2 and cluster 2 = 13.8% \u00b1 3.1) in our previous study. The cluster with higher DNA damage and lower levels of DHA (6.2 \u00b1 1.6 mg/dL; 5.4 \u00b1 1.3 mg/dL, p = 0.003) and EPA (0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mg/dL; 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 mg/dL, p < 0.001) presented increased expression of the proteins CDK8\u2013CCNC, PIK3CA\u2013PIK3R1, KYNU, and PRKCB, which are involved in pro-inflammatory pathways.

These biogenic amines are known to raise vaginal pH, cause malodour, and make the environment more favourable to vaginal pathogens. In vitro experiments confirmed that strains isolated from women with a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota have higher antimicrobial effects against the common urogenital pathogens Escherichia coli and En-terococcus faecium. The results indicate that not all L. crispatus vaginal strains appear suitable for probiotic application and the basis for selection should not be only the overall composition of the vaginal microbiota of the host from which they came, but specific biochemical and genetic traits."

An integrated, automated platform for the routine online/at-line monitoring of key factors in the cell culture medium could greatly improve process monitoring. Mono- and disaccharides, as the main energy and carbon source, are one of these key factors. A CE-LIF method was developed for the analysis of several mono- and disaccharides, considering requirements and restrictions for analysis in an integrated, automated monitoring platform, such as the possibility for miniaturization to microchip electrophoresis. Analysis was performed after fluorescent derivatization with 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid. The derivatisation reaction and the separation BGE were optimized using design of experiments. The developed method is applicable to the complex matrix of cell culture medium and proved transferable to microchip electrophoresis."

  "description": "Building bridges: The role of authenticity in academic educationUniversities educate students in various disciplines, so as to go to work in society with an academic frame of mind. However, only a fraction of students pursue an academic career; the majority end up in business, government or the non-profit sector. These non-academic worlds, also known as business systems, are fundamentally different economic organisations. Although academia is typically non-vocational, we want to properly prepare students for the job-market by bridging the gap between the world of science and the world of business, while realising that each of these worlds has its own logic. The overarching logic of the world of science is to contribute to our collective body of knowledge, while the overarching logic of the world of business is to make money. Many bridges have been suggested and built; in this article, we build a bridge from an educational perspective."

  "description": "Sixteen capillary Electrophoresis applications for viral vaccine analysisA broad range of CE applications from our organization are reviewed to give a flavour of the use of CE within the field of vaccine analyses. Applicability of CE for viral vaccine characterization, and release and stability testing of seasonal influenza virosomal vaccines, universal subunit influenza vaccines, Sabin inactivated polio vaccines (sIPV), and adenovirus vector vaccines was demonstrated. Diverse CZE, CE-SDS, CGE, and cIEF methods were developed, validated, and applied for virus, protein, post translational modifications, DNA, and excipient concentration determinations, as well as for integrity and composition verifications, and identity testing (e.g., CZE for intact virus particles, CE-SDS application for hemagglutinin quantification and influenza strain identification, chloride or bromide determination in process samples). Results were supported by other methods such as RP-HPLC, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurements. Overall, sixteen CE methods are presented that were developed and applied, comprising six adenovirus methods, five viral protein methods, and methods for antibodies determination of glycans, host cell-DNA, excipient chloride and process impurity bromide. These methods were applied to support in-process control, release, stability, process- and product characterization and development, and critical reagent testing. Thirteen methods were validated. Intact virus particles were analyzed at concentrations as low as 0.8 pmol/L. Overall, CE took viral vaccine testing beyond what was previously possible, improved process and product understanding and, in total, safety, efficacy and quality.

  "description": "Predicting the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders with knowledge graphsGut microbiota produce and modulate the production of neurotransmitters which have been implicated in mental disorders. Neurotransmitters may act as 'matchmaker' between gut microbiota imbalance and mental disorders. Most of the relevant research effort goes into the relationship between gut microbiota and neurotransmitters and the other between neurotransmitters and mental disorders, while few studies collect and analyze the dispersed research results in systematic ways. We therefore gather the dispersed results that in the existing studies into a structured knowledge base for identifying and predicting the potential relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders. In this study, we propose to construct a gut microbiota knowledge graph for mental disorder, which named as MiKG4MD. It is extendable by linking to future ontologies by just adding new relationships between existing information and new entities. This extendibility is emphasized for the integration with existing popular ontologies/terminologies, e.g. UMLS, MeSH, and KEGG. We demonstrate the performance of MiKG4MD with three SPARQL query test cases. Results show that the MiKG4MD knowledge graph is an effective method to predict the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders."

  "title": "Elevated plasma succinate levels are linked to higher cardiovascular disease risk factors in young adults\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).Background: Succinate is produced by both host and microbiota, with a key role in the interplay of immunity and metabolism and an emerging role as a biomarker for inflammatory and metabolic disorders in middle-aged adults. The relationship between plasma succinate levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in young adults is unknown. Methods: Cross-sectional study in 100 (65% women) individuals aged 18\u201325 years from the ACTIvating Brown Adipose Tissue through Exercise (ACTIBATE) study cohort. CVD risk factors, body composition, dietary intake, basal metabolic rate, and cardiorespiratory fitness were assessed by routine methods. Plasma succinate was measured with an enzyme-based assay. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) was evaluated by positron emission tomography, and circulating oxylipins were assessed by targeted metabolomics. Fecal microbiota composition was analyzed in a sub-sample. Results: Individuals with higher succinate levels had higher levels of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass (+ 42.5%), triglycerides (+ 63.9%), C-reactive protein (+ 124.2%), diastolic blood pressure (+ 5.5%), and pro-inflammatory omega-6 oxylipins than individuals with lower succinate levels. Succinate levels were also higher in metabolically unhealthy individuals than in healthy overweight/obese peers. Succinate levels were not associated with BAT volume or activity or with fecal microbiota composition and diversity. Conclusions: Plasma succinate levels are linked to a specific pro-inflammatory omega-6 signature pattern and higher VAT levels, and seem to reflect the cardiovascular status of young adults.General information",

  "title": "Physiological and interactomic analysis reveals versatile functions of Arabidopsis 14-3-3 quadruple mutants in response to Fe deficiency\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).To date, few phenotypes have been described for Arabidopsis 14-3-3 mutants or the phenotypes showing the role of 14-3-3 in plant responding to abiotic stress. Although one member of the 14-3-3 protein family (14-3-3 omicron) was shown to be involved in the proper operation of Fe acquisition mechanisms at physiological and gene expression levels in Arabidopsis thaliana, it remains to be explored whether other members play a role in regulating iron acquisition. To more directly and effectively observe whether members of 14-3-3 non-epsilon group have a function in Fe-deficiency adaptation, three higher order quadruple KOs, kappa/lambda/phi/chi (klpc), kappa/lambda/upsilon/nu(klun), and upsilon/nu/phi/chi (unpc) were generated and studied for physiological analysis in this study. The analysis of iron-utilization efficiency, root phenotyping, and transcriptional level of Fe-responsive genes suggested that the mutant with kl background showed different phenotypes from Wt when plants suffered Fe starved, while these phenotypes were absent in the unpc mutant. Moreover, the absence of the four 14-3-3 isoforms in the klun mutant has a clear impact on the 14-3-3 interactome upon Fe deficiency. Dynamics of 14-3-3-client interactions analysis showed that 27 and 17 proteins differentially interacted with 14-3-3 in Wt and klun roots caused by Fe deficiency, respectively.
