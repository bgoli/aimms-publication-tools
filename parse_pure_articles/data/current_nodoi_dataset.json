  "description": "Different resource allocation in a Bacillus subtilis population displaying bimodal motilityTo cope with sudden changes in their environment, bacteria can use a bet-hedging strategy by dividing the population into cells with different properties. This so-called bimodal or bistable cellular differentiation is generally controlled by positive feedback regulation of transcriptional activators. Due to the continuous increase in cell volume, it is difficult for these activators to reach an activation threshold concentration when cells are growing exponentially. This is one reason why bimodal differentiation is primarily observed from the onset of the stationary phase when exponential growth ceases. An exception is the bimodal induction of motility in Bacillus subtilis, which occurs early during exponential growth. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain this, including double negative-feedback regulation and the stability of the mRNA molecules involved. In this study, we used fluorescence-assisted cell sorting to compare the transcriptome of motile and non-motile cells and noted that expression of ribosomal genes is lower in motile cells. This was confirmed using an unstable GFP reporter fused to the strong ribosomal rpsD promoter. We propose that the reduction in ribosomal gene expression in motile cells is the result of a diversion of cellular resources to the synthesis of the chemotaxis and motility systems. In agreement, single-cell microscopic analysis showed that motile cells are slightly shorter than non-motile cells, an indication of slower growth. We speculate that this growth rate reduction can contribute to the bimodal induction of motility during exponential growth."

  "description": "Protein cost allocation explains metabolic strategies in Escherichia coliIn-depth understanding of microbial growth is crucial for the development of new advances in biotechnology and for combating microbial pathogens. Condition-specific proteome expression is central to microbial physiology and growth. A multitude of processes are dependent on the protein expression, thus, whole-cell analysis of microbial metabolism using genome-scale metabolic models is an attractive toolset to investigate the behaviour of microorganisms and their communities. However, genome-scale models that incorporate macromolecular expression are still inhibitory complex: the conceptual and computational complexity of these models severely limits their potential applications. In the need for alternatives, here we revisit some of the previous attempts to create genome-scale models of metabolism and macromolecular expression to develop a novel framework for integrating protein abundance and turnover costs to conventional genome-scale models. We show that such a model of Escherichia coli successfully reproduces experimentally determined adaptations of metabolism in a growth condition-dependent manner. Moreover, the model can be used as means of investigating underutilization of the protein machinery among different growth settings. Notably, we obtained strongly improved predictions of flux distributions, considering the costs of protein translation explicitly. This finding in turn suggests protein translation being the main regulation hub for cellular growth."

  "description": "Site-Specific N-Linked Glycosylation Analysis of Human Carcinoembryonic Antigen by Sheathless Capillary Electrophoresis-Tandem Mass SpectrometryWith 28 potential N-glycosylation sites, human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) bears an extreme amount of N-linked glycosylation, and approximately 60% of its molecular mass can be attributed to its carbohydrates. CEA is often overexpressed and released by many solid tumors, including colorectal carcinomas. CEA displays an impressive heterogeneity and variability in sugar content; however, site-specific distribution of carbohydrate structures has not been reported so far. The present study investigated CEA samples purified from human colon carcinoma and human liver metastases and enabled the characterization of 21 out of 28 potential N-glycosylation sites with respect to their occupancy. The coverage was achieved by a multienzymatic digestion approach with specific enzymes, such as trypsin, endoproteinase Glu-C, and the nonspecific enzyme, Pronase, followed by analysis using sheathless CE-MS/MS. In total, 893 different N-glycopeptides and 128 unique N-glycan compositions were identified. Overall, a great heterogeneity was found both within (micro) and in between (macro) individual N-glycosylation sites. Moreover, notable differences were found on certain N-glycosylation sites between primary adenocarcinoma and metastatic tumor in regard to branching, bisection, sialylation, and fucosylation. Those features, if further investigated in a targeted manner, may pave the way toward improved diagnostics and monitoring of colorectal cancer progression and recurrence. Raw mass spectrometric data and Skyline processed data files that support the findings of this study are available in the MassIVE repository with the identifier MSV000086774 [DOI: 10.25345/C5Z50X]."

  "description": "Bicyclic \u03b2-sheet mimetics that target the transcriptional coactivator \u03b2-catenin and inhibit Wnt signalingProtein complexes are defined by the three-dimensional structure of participating binding partners. Knowledge about these structures can facilitate the design of peptidomimetics which have been applied e.g. as inhibitors of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Even though \u03b2-sheets participate widely in PPIs, they have only rarely served as the basis for peptidomimetic PPI inhibitors, in particular when addressing intracellular targets. Here, we present the structure-based design of \u03b2-sheet mimetics targeting the intracellular protein \u03b2-catenin, a central component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Based on a protein binding partner of \u03b2-catenin, a macrocyclic peptide was designed and its crystal structure in complex with \u03b2-catenin obtained. Using this structure, we designed a library of bicyclic \u03b2-sheet mimetics employing a late-stage diversification strategy. Several mimetics were identified that compete with transcription factor binding to \u03b2-catenin and inhibit Wnt signaling in cells. The presented design strategy can support the development of inhibitors for other \u03b2-sheet-mediated PPIs."
